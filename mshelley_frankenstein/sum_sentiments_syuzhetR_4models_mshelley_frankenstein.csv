"6","5,""I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.""",0.2,1,2,0

"12","11,""Therefor with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.""",0.65,3,5,2
"13","12,""Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.""",0.75,1,4,1
"14","13,What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?",0,0,0,0
"15","14,I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.",2.75,2,1,5
"16","15,""I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.""",1.25,1,1,3
"17","16,""These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.""",1.3,-1,-3,1
"18","17,""But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.""",1,1,2,3
"19","18,""These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.""",2.2,4,2,2
"20","19,This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.",0.85,0,3,1
"21","20,I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.",0.6,0,1,2
"22","21,You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas library.",2.75,1,3,4
"23","22,""My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.""",0.85,1,0,0
"24","23,""These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.""",0.55,-3,-5,1
"25","24,""These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.""",1.4,2,3,0
"26","25,I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.",0.5,1,3,0
"27","26,You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.",-1.7,-2,-6,-4
"28","27,""But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.""",0.1,0,2,1

"30","29,""I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.""",1,2,5,0
"31","30,I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.",-0.75,-1,-2,-1
"32","31,""I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.""",2.3,0,7,1
"33","32,""Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.""",0.5,1,2,2
"34","33,""I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.""",3,5,7,5
"35","34,""And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?""",2,2,7,3
"36","35,""My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.""",3.3,3,9,4
"37","36,""Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!""",1.5,2,2,1
"38","37,""My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.""",0.6,0,4,1
"39","38,""I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.""",-1,-1,-4,0
"40","39,This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.",0,0,2,0
"41","40,""They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.""",1.75,2,5,2
"42","41,""The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in fursa dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.""",-1.7,-3,1,-2
"43","42,I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.",0.35,-1,-1,0
"44","43,""I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.""",1.2,0,1,1

"59","58,""But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.""",0.3,-1,-1,2
"60","59,""I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.""",0,-1,2,1

"63","62,""I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.""",4.6,5,3,3
"64","63,How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!",0.2,-2,-1,2
"65","64,I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.",-1.75,-1,-1,-2
"66","65,But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages.",-0.5,-1,0,0
"67","66,At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.",2.25,3,7,1

"69","68,""It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.""",2.5,3,10,6
"70","69,""Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.""",-0.15,-1,-4,0
"71","70,""Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.""",0,0,0,-1
"72","71,""My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.""",5,3,7,7
"73","72,""He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.""",1.25,-1,2,3
"74","73,""I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.""",0.65,-1,-1,1
"75","74,The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.",2,3,5,3
"76","75,""This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.""",4.1,4,9,3
"77","76,""A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.""",6.25,3,11,5
"78","77,""I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.""",1.25,2,3,2
"79","78,""This, briefly, is his story.""",0,0,0,0
"80","79,""Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.""",1.9,3,5,5
"81","80,""He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.""",0.1,-1,1,0
"82","81,""My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.""",1.4,3,2,2
"83","82,""He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover.""",3.7,1,2,4
"84","83,""But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.""",-0.7,-3,-2,-1
"85","84,What a noble fellow! you will exclaim.",1.15,1,2,2
"86","85,""He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.""",-0.95,-1,2,0
"87","86,""Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.""",-2.35,-1,-3,-2
"88","87,""Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.""",-1,-1,-1,-2
"89","88,""The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.""",0.55,1,-1,0

"93","92,""I am going to unexplored regions, to the land of mist and snow, but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the Ancient Mariner.""",-1.55,-5,-9,-3
"94","93,""You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret.""",0.75,1,2,1
"95","94,""I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.""",2.2,3,2,4
