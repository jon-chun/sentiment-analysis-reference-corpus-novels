4,4,0,"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of
Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. Therefor with your leave, my sister, I will put
some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour therefor with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine,2198,384,12.800000000000002,2.88139705935173,2.797814207650274,2.88139705935173,0.5805905247580728,10.8,2.4824860256656813,2.347826086956522,2.4824860256656813,0.49209161239341837,172.64590876612402,2.388407958428978,1.939517194906953,2.388407958428978,0.42466865351030614,0.07291666666666696,0.24773305722319547,0.1807162534435266,0.24773305722319547,0.14684640566552262,16.694,3.521065362279311,3.494277742982405,3.521065362279311,0.4568989746879543,125.38679826885928,3.443978185346663,3.5834029755601278,3.443978185346663,0.711343184996737,3.635977469961613,1.8022664697343416,1.6921005243788771,1.8022664697343416,0.3605641527188555,"{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.97}",0.97,1.2515650546748767,0.6101108577718375,1.2515650546748767,0.16600757209434494,0.06136363636363637,-0.06749589088478328,-0.041229211420733575,-0.06749589088478328,-0.18341892792475947,0.22648564950668232,0.2130592765969607,0.36543822278067256,0.2130592765969607,-0.13770102166826975,65.77813786566918,3.7132883414783397,3.034845402586025,3.7132883414783397,-0.9330937550833469,0.9994,1.2106624318871788,0.8857256135773575,1.2106624318871788,0.311402505428394

whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well

18,18,0,"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no
friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts
to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet
courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution
and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages.
At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my
daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters

20,20,0,"The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to
the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard
of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw
his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend
reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his
money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old
man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
inclinations. What a noble fellow! you will exclaim. He is
so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
otherwise he would command.",the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his well known integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prize money the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prize money to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command,2252,395,24.800000000000015,5.627324758086352,5.420765027322409,5.627324758086352,1.0935679757468515,22.80000000000001,5.269275613306401,4.956521739130437,5.269275613306401,1.0099297901610076,214.701253063132,2.9192332994465047,2.4119701130486413,2.9192332994465047,0.5134079883849965,12.934766666666668,6.589787917366143,6.530147438016529,6.589787917366143,1.396824973299279,34.81700000000002,7.87443654811606,7.621818595911862,7.87443654811606,1.2946557402051388,162.6377134301314,4.506956954388847,4.647989056983282,4.506956954388847,0.8969799816408979,6.571973288423341,3.275126935480189,3.0584456420359816,3.275126935480189,0.6335651521447044,"{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.192, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956,1.2859310068158205,0.6262127525748881,1.2859310068158205,0.16564379822632874,0.2583333333333333,0.8360183983999843,0.8398333888031628,0.8360183983999843,0.03686870864237669,1.5509171076170165,4.413817470212584,4.114024456327107,4.413817470212584,0.7912910655785574,68.8414201962345,3.9650528636631717,3.2315135795638366,3.9650528636631717,-0.8790423426882569,0.882,1.0833493098804445,0.8256660144010027,1.0833493098804445,0.2946873256441129

this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection. There was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind
which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and
worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had

afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,
hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passionremembering what she had suffered and how she had been relievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of half clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were dark eyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heaven sent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features,1612,290,8.5,1.8974396339718242,1.8579234972677598,1.8974396339718242,0.5105192545286501,8.5,1.9483513547012106,1.847826086956522,1.9483513547012106,0.5128311056360528,29.939346137558616,0.5871562735596025,0.33634087858246353,0.5871562735596025,0.0975145569053585,-5.329761904761904,-2.41627592217858,-2.4863911845730016,-2.41627592217858,-0.5660734160058167,6.191000000000001,0.998113446766244,1.1022034959858793,0.998113446766244,0.04194941498802227,63.77480815644455,1.685840509415878,1.8226068491162437,1.685840509415878,0.47908188489492176,1.3840417131350027,0.6725689658165218,0.6441012706777588,0.6725689658165218,0.18173717350047291,"{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.151, 'compound': 0.97}",0.97,1.2515650546748767,0.6101108577718375,1.2515650546748767,0.21981692304906364,-0.0067840608465608325,-0.3800943218035126,-0.34605979311434515,-0.3800943218035126,-0.26507590089992167,-0.03037121581225857,-0.6016250734066604,-0.36155304840239266,-0.6016250734066604,-0.3310786561835548,51.728559028420726,2.5585839684716207,2.1328374388872398,2.5585839684716207,-0.8049370219940354,0.9816,1.191359420203023,0.8766194733274503,1.191359420203023,0.3467697238307692

our villa a child fairer than pictured cheruba creature who seemed
to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter

permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their

the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us

disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.

the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a

indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry
Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular
talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous

with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new

author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and
studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always
having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his

98,98,2,"Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of

I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so

108,108,3,"I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasureI was now alone. In the university whither I was going I
must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and
Clerval; these were old familiar faces, but I believed myself
totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as
I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had

113,113,3,"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I
returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a
strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come
to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been
content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
It was very different when the masters of the science sought
immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit

unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an

temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person
was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took
a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he

118,118,3,"I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of
insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I
had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the mornings dawn,
sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream.
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a
natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had
given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius
Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
exhibited. He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. I
listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have

123,123,4,"As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,
with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years
passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was
engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I
hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive
of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my

124,124,4,"One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became
acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.",one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the because and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret,2316,405,-4.15,-0.99722581511092,-0.9071038251366123,-0.99722581511092,-0.17847782798118533,-4.15,-0.9893893356033779,-0.9021739130434784,-0.9893893356033779,-0.1792860524714567,-85.63656246441711,-0.8716504993389153,-0.9620476187330923,-0.8716504993389153,-0.19972357952994155,-0.895833333333333,-0.22994827522613961,-0.2975206611570243,-0.22994827522613961,0.05463015718000429,9.555,1.8061883057385335,1.868359619654956,1.8061883057385335,0.08403978848802447,6.2475192820553875,0.04426240457492242,0.17854654153607666,0.04426240457492242,0.03360556245570049,0.655055463621578,0.306868503905371,0.3048477892529468,0.306868503905371,0.06159077061580222,"{'neg': 0.159, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': -0.976}",-0.976,-1.3607842760390432,-0.6138847393663025,-1.3607842760390432,-0.1583733788973068,0.2393939393939394,0.7491420244302953,0.7551158310893268,0.7491420244302953,0.008826225086150129,1.354641222647161,3.7912805114690453,3.5584977238037765,3.7912805114690453,0.6293633399657458,67.96200435073871,3.8927755851590526,3.1750535172922865,3.8927755851590526,-0.9962895458318822,-0.91,-0.8599651248390434,-0.0910869815447186,-0.8599651248390434,0.09213784393040617

128,128,4,"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated
a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the
creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor
could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I
began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,

with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone
possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon
gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive
the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,

brought my work near to a conclusion.",these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hiding places who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnel houses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion,1693,290,-5.6499999999999995,-1.3404667774527472,-1.2349726775956285,-1.3404667774527472,-0.33934515153963213,-6.65,-1.5699704996951938,-1.4456521739130437,-1.5699704996951938,-0.40121492382114726,-89.81803841267585,-0.9244293656945272,-1.0090226357473906,-0.9244293656945272,-0.2925436707160755,-2.985119047619047,-1.260155019863415,-1.32892561983471,-1.260155019863415,-0.25565644417408606,2.0869999999999993,0.012281335820263554,0.16751124523145225,0.012281335820263554,-0.22345490452419825,-12.754961631288909,-0.49798558269102344,-0.36452136982324873,-0.49798558269102344,-0.09581637697898435,-2.076062569702504,-1.0632137534583845,-0.9661519060166383,-1.0632137534583845,-0.2726057602507093,"{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': -0.6887}",-0.6887,-0.975107008457281,-0.43317870901800465,-0.975107008457281,-0.1560700153648352,-0.039561403508771936,-0.5304463704470513,-0.49267570002128563,-0.5304463704470513,-0.3154557321705225,-0.13209909756964497,-0.9242799229231558,-0.6494771495617373,-0.9242799229231558,-0.4287471055128768,50.86353295771135,2.487489354306762,2.0773012257647308,2.487489354306762,-0.858952327564709,0.8591,1.0585156600171208,0.8139508114952232,1.0585156600171208,0.32767083148918413

133,133,4,"I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was
justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself
has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic

138,138,5,"The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had
deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty
of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, I beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom I had
created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have
spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the
courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest

had so miserably given life.",the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the grave worms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life,2165,396,-14.35,-3.3312643590353463,-3.136612021857924,-3.3312643590353463,-0.6311722750210866,-14.35,-3.3581604850979865,-3.1195652173913047,-3.3581604850979865,-0.634030494980521,-157.44758557963013,-1.778053989100915,-1.768778082902337,-1.778053989100915,-0.37554843594828446,-1.3625000000000007,-0.4600571321479703,-0.5278971533516987,-0.4600571321479703,0.007454220076881315,-0.9050000000000008,-0.7064344721598467,-0.513921311848773,-0.7064344721598467,-0.4012804887814244,-81.3188567150657,-2.4545003282042335,-2.323994528491641,-2.4545003282042335,-0.4473574403385791,-2.6287893153693362,-1.3404925448428924,-1.2233782568143925,-1.3404925448428924,-0.2527860960577356,"{'neg': 0.185, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.9938}",-0.9938,-1.3846793521370433,-0.6250805880965487,-1.3846793521370433,-0.16492678552688286,-0.02404214559386974,-0.45925840853752437,-0.42325670845857527,-0.45925840853752437,-0.2817105255863499,-0.049566347226708746,-0.6625071259077592,-0.41588172274087876,-0.6625071259077592,-0.336769497304217,63.41954223328524,3.5194404886410897,2.883419365677709,3.5194404886410897,-1.1349484075132434,-0.9997,-0.9572392904608839,-0.13697578943329627,-0.9572392904608839,0.07958736197680272

that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and
on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,

to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear

calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial

some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
permitted to come to Ingolstadt. You may easily believe, said
he, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch

148,148,5,"I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a
quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to
behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the
lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a
cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed

166,166,6,"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountainsthey
never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one
change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on
what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;
I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,
her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed
this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in

recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelicashe looked so
frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;
Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not
mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She

exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The
conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months
after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature
to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her
repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz
into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;
and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,

176,176,6,"One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the
several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of
no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I
had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the
subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What
could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I
thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real because he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply,2042,368,1.5500000000000005,0.30708984178802423,0.3387978142076504,0.30708984178802423,0.07336266141644128,0.8000000000000007,0.16016136929841787,0.17391304347826103,0.16016136929841787,0.038036066658428506,-43.42738827619208,-0.3388835072463835,-0.4878665639605479,-0.3388835072463835,-0.11146564445529351,4.062500000000002,2.214958329568307,2.1502295684113877,2.214958329568307,0.5634059429309292,8.601,1.5770255781940734,1.6510846666287078,1.5770255781940734,0.0799080501367098,-12.57222512463344,-0.49277107920667285,-0.35929898157557544,-0.49277107920667285,-0.07442569811697022,0.16644244267120048,0.06175275916173122,0.07745849550762286,0.06175275916173122,0.017223001918488117,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9722}",0.9722,1.2545183786869891,0.6114946143564747,1.2545183786869891,0.17361817472715965,-0.007987711213517672,-0.3856155533562812,-0.3514438259802463,-0.3856155533562812,-0.2643236817676602,-0.04184109114490744,-0.6380045874149728,-0.39401665118770157,-0.6380045874149728,-0.3335762316532787,61.417261345672976,3.354877370863926,2.754869369474275,3.354877370863926,-1.0128170447668445,-0.9981,-0.9555041882870271,-0.13615725997263042,-0.9555041882870271,0.0710992435455114
177,177,6,"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. Dn
the fellow! cried he; why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has
outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A
youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly
as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.Ay,
ay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,

literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He
came to the university with the design of making himself complete
master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of
any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How
different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!",clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of rosesin the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome,1433,250,11.249999999999998,2.5267147315985072,2.459016393442623,2.5267147315985072,0.7837972084233981,9.249999999999998,2.122525703928755,2.010869565217391,2.122525703928755,0.6473738545264525,76.62303362906873,1.1764008689105803,0.8607889541757422,1.1764008689105803,0.28949726961148253,4.057980952380952,2.212730030535461,2.14799867768595,2.212730030535461,0.7627691776522078,16.233,3.410327398549756,3.389284290838694,3.410327398549756,0.8593274626304243,128.82071832886857,3.5419672978979926,3.6815402558062327,3.5419672978979926,1.122546381997384,2.4886884934390228,1.226721857006833,1.158178547461766,1.226721857006833,0.37907323279706934,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9512}",0.9512,1.2263275585713713,0.5982860287758472,1.2263275585713713,0.2500456024298479,0.14015151515151517,0.29390982482912387,0.31119582866882506,0.29390982482912387,-0.004764405728811439,0.7737999727272832,1.9490004713436315,1.9145217369813834,1.9490004713436315,0.5598696891727983,46.21850059243899,2.1057242318735137,1.779081881708234,2.1057242318735137,-0.6872370560407347,0.8204,1.0165478761869622,0.7941526301653686,1.0165478761869622,0.3421024222704615

182,182,6,"We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature
who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I

a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, William, dear angel! this is thy
funeral, this thy dirge! As I said these words, I perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning
illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
dmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth
chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could
have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not
doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
perpendicular ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the

remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at
the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited

but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the

tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:

had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems
sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor

did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight
oclock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;

which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round

know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived
in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
uncles house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to
the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
her.",i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her,1435,269,9.1,2.0347360189085553,1.9890710382513663,2.0347360189085553,0.5892238411113526,9.1,2.0876908340832463,1.9782608695652175,2.0876908340832463,0.5918921004913814,106.14566122865912,1.5490374297388543,1.1924483851895828,1.5490374297388543,0.3727134841704606,8.763933333333332,4.533190008627284,4.471157539026629,4.533190008627284,1.3904297534737908,18.224999999999994,3.8888307038627152,3.842965324830607,3.8888307038627152,0.9121942386771428,38.474581888370864,0.9638823170199607,1.0995569958377425,0.9638823170199607,0.31158763550042456,2.809624392433859,1.38772133619402,1.3075347542775642,1.38772133619402,0.3977302036083263,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.713, 'pos': 0.22, 'compound': 0.9948}",0.9948,1.284857070811416,0.6257095683622927,1.284857070811416,0.24303615438727041,0.25795454545454544,0.8342808709205906,0.8381390376488861,0.8342808709205906,0.17278818010365332,1.0125409884002188,2.7062259748597617,2.5902390640307877,2.7062259748597617,0.746107964792221,47.93921619590272,2.2471461104249704,1.8895548856014253,2.2471461104249704,-0.8078641349986332,0.997,1.2080597786263938,0.8844978193863587,1.2080597786263938,0.3613055733223106

particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at
ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had
retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the
water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and
sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenlyif I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shoreoften,
I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,
when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my

exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose
among them?",about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten of the clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyif i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shoreoften i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them,1316,243,-4.15,-0.99722581511092,-0.9071038251366123,-0.99722581511092,-0.29746304663530887,-5.15,-1.2216218012401043,-1.1195652173913044,-1.2216218012401043,-0.37081251816385624,-30.763275895673495,-0.17903624204277108,-0.34559696779233945,-0.17903624204277108,-0.1195780439868395,-3.484,-1.5061484320615333,-1.5752051423324143,-1.5061484320615333,-0.41092048348005045,6.028999999999999,0.9591990213341655,1.0653077492455723,0.9591990213341655,0.10688441541721624,-25.804356947483146,-0.8703584521869707,-0.7374572980941304,-0.8703584521869707,-0.23133713555677127,0.0,-0.021744121893440656,0.0,-0.021744121893440656,0.0,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.8718}",0.8718,1.1197394101342257,0.5483449956757608,1.1197394101342257,0.23577512247724058,0.13893387314439945,0.2883244126079146,0.30574920997855887,0.2883244126079146,0.0002003608645712604,0.47897294753727027,1.0138844755839693,1.080062149709438,1.0138844755839693,0.2468842636685191,44.4542977024772,1.9607282276866056,1.665816916632768,1.9607282276866056,-0.7222683066112564,-0.6731,-0.6030615592223878,0.030106536725114767,-0.6030615592223878,0.0684890298607502

mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that
could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had
created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling
that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained
behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of
him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to
extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I
reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his

276,276,9,"When I reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of
Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood. Yet I am
certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human
being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel
she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on
the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a
wretch.",when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch,1594,296,-2.0500000000000007,-0.5166884678323618,-0.4480874316939893,-0.5166884678323618,-0.12062945024534286,-1.2500000000000004,-0.31591518525687146,-0.2717391304347827,-0.31591518525687146,-0.07388762948850128,-194.30944015418996,-2.243326758879935,-2.1828869447599812,-2.243326758879935,-0.6200508793307546,-3.483333333333334,-1.5058197051230737,-1.574876033057851,-1.5058197051230737,-0.3122689957977484,5.2269999999999985,0.7665485941951117,0.8826510277287473,0.7665485941951117,-0.027244071603369672,-31.86670142615544,-1.0433513422555725,-0.9107117678124156,-1.0433513422555725,-0.23453301512185296,-2.4178119010461843,-1.234654419744792,-1.1251942068972531,-1.234654419744792,-0.3110451169120155,"{'neg': 0.181, 'neu': 0.65, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': -0.7345}",-0.7345,-1.0365898447094382,-0.4619860051890873,-1.0365898447094382,-0.1630750337631158,0.09271428571428571,0.07631181203829991,0.09900497211380392,0.07631181203829991,-0.11503234956092366,0.40661596192831506,0.7843866044024582,0.8752675576649087,0.7843866044024582,0.08055731717805831,51.98295587249296,2.5794922926094594,2.1491701689961755,2.5794922926094594,-0.8548488897552093,-0.9999,-0.9574561782326159,-0.1370781056158795,-0.9574561782326159,0.04099540400060551

the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.

recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
kindly influence ceased to actI found myself fettered again to grief

285,285,10,"I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside
the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling
waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I
had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the
unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,

mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was
brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of
Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous

It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the

windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I
received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,

time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very
uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a
league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I
now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,

troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,

perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and
horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely

was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards
his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I
complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with
his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy

my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,
and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By
degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I
was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now
suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,
descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light
became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I
walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the
forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst
at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep,1378,257,-7.1,-1.6722663743831803,-1.551912568306011,-1.6722663743831803,-0.4811898123481303,-6.1000000000000005,-1.4422426435949942,-1.3260869565217392,-1.4422426435949942,-0.4152887277959156,-122.15463519275932,-1.332584031886507,-1.3722944093328582,-1.332584031886507,-0.44895412480205854,-2.5937500000000004,-1.0671746966158349,-1.1357208448117537,-1.0671746966158349,-0.24793529257452462,-3.0380000000000003,-1.2188077403488757,-0.9997153105961393,-1.2188077403488757,-0.5801141654767011,-25.725001139364835,-0.8680939832775558,-0.7351894051192306,-0.8680939832775558,-0.21806243932045255,-2.12424117141672,-1.087382847063212,-0.9885731222914812,-1.087382847063212,-0.314748222731703,"{'neg': 0.138, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.9541}",-0.9541,-1.3313852779184703,-0.6001100715465053,-1.3313852779184703,-0.24397659200739047,0.10013227513227516,0.11033866764110759,0.1321862844963509,0.11033866764110759,-0.08097973195147792,0.3647688477025043,0.6516582499928946,0.7568261575154935,0.6516582499928946,0.09326237624254248,46.37926557593172,2.118937156731677,1.7894032797425925,2.118937156731677,-0.7670949267819085,-0.9876,-0.9441175802710926,-0.130785660387011,-0.9441175802710926,0.019981836849690647

pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,
but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with
which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct
ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,
and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on

greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each

drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted
when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,
with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I

left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live
embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,
I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I
examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the
operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat
dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching
the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with
it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank

309,309,11,"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When
I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto
inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be
more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how
to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of
this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at
length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken

310,310,11,"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This
was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great
curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on
hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever
before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted
by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as Pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell
after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the
remnants of the shepherds breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by
fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep,1149,207,4.1,0.8905994777691306,0.8961748633879782,0.8905994777691306,0.344988572682333,5.099999999999999,1.1587609715363407,1.1086956521739129,1.1587609715363407,0.4310754221288559,47.373017781721146,0.8072052316740307,0.5321920642020422,0.8072052316740307,0.21616523238995297,-1.2708333333333344,-0.4148571781097538,-0.4826446280991737,-0.4148571781097538,-0.09615797852246091,9.953999999999999,1.9020330943027257,1.9592324773671916,1.9020330943027257,0.5434120831383524,58.698004713639534,1.5409706652539688,1.6775179496910195,1.5409706652539688,0.61774832987659,0.0,-0.021744121893440656,0.0,-0.021744121893440656,0.0,"{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.6957}",-0.6957,-0.9845039484958203,-0.43758157087821375,-0.9845039484958203,-0.22087117722953206,0.11816498316498314,0.19305600758075558,0.21284815722502926,0.19305600758075558,-0.00020036086457130874,0.3317552010614888,0.5469473978161838,0.6633864399975732,0.5469473978161838,0.14431154633849483,39.390958402868854,1.5445833667621072,1.3407415229813084,1.5445833667621072,-0.5890795312002972,-0.9752,-0.9306705384237032,-0.12444205706685083,-0.9306705384237032,-0.01927765461333887

shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my
travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a
wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One
of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within
the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had
beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,
was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and

314,314,11,"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until
something should occur which might alter my determination. It was
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw

behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
house and sometimes in the yard.",being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the rain dropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard,1336,240,-2.220446049250313e-16,-0.04759248596519758,-4.853433987432379e-17,-0.04759248596519758,-1.6114624211640358e-17,-2.220446049250313e-16,-0.02562460321096343,-4.827056628805029e-17,-0.02562460321096343,-1.618759817197307e-17,-46.26205000354809,-0.3746627953070483,-0.5197113681684447,-0.3746627953070483,-0.18207015850224975,-4.58725,-2.0501504243451243,-2.119839853076216,-2.0501504243451243,-0.5942952362419047,5.855000000000002,0.9174020458700822,1.0256789842282072,0.9174020458700822,0.09910392909188151,12.915894270943795,0.2345487641586374,0.36912062993488753,0.2345487641586374,0.11723892460287609,-0.35811507988884816,-0.201394767183546,-0.16665854490960336,-0.201394767183546,-0.05682035663761405,"{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.817}",-0.817,-1.147339495163651,-0.5138768771129807,-1.147339495163651,-0.2237165961254925,-0.057499999999999996,-0.6127320139185527,-0.5729166036327696,-0.6127320139185527,-0.36144029764984176,-0.2092888989201362,-1.1691062508550505,-0.8679502347038528,-1.1691062508550505,-0.5447185919972419,42.794752046717356,1.8243337742934753,1.559271132238973,1.8243337742934753,-0.8060755952648372,-0.9645,-0.9190670426360367,-0.11896814129864818,-0.9190670426360367,0.012026555946312453
315,315,11,"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,
either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the
window, unable to bear these emotions.",on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions,1543,278,8.4,1.8745569031490357,1.836065573770492,1.8745569031490357,0.5262906915073178,7.400000000000002,1.6928956425008121,1.6086956521739135,1.6928956425008121,0.46573658599025386,165.97207069181076,2.3041703322506297,1.8645427932911578,2.3041703322506297,0.5639172176107017,2.4562500000000003,1.4229318622168283,1.3572819100091829,1.4229318622168283,0.47878603707786477,4.726999999999999,0.6464423428615373,0.7687752661845921,0.6464423428615373,-0.03953157582187938,38.39355943140749,0.9615702892162186,1.0972414720555081,0.9615702892162186,0.30086534572524887,3.317258530698656,1.6423791421117797,1.5437760397769351,1.6423791421117797,0.4543882699759464,"{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.199, 'compound': 0.988}",0.988,1.2757286147739777,0.6214325025552324,1.2757286147739777,0.2335605755099671,0.09753703703703705,0.09843412222514669,0.12057755858790631,0.09843412222514669,-0.0982597518876239,0.5518482083792324,1.245026183385541,1.2863236348813851,1.245026183385541,0.2507776307601609,50.10806306897443,2.4253989248138406,2.0287987144888273,2.4253989248138406,-0.7710650126136898,0.922,1.1267268642268617,0.8461292509176483,1.1267268642268617,0.34368249486110375

the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they
suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment
consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,

these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the
mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth
and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or
_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot

these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other

329,329,12,"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,
often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that
he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus
with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his

separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, Good night
sweet Safie. He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely

384,384,15,"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In
the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a
more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon
death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not

386,386,15,"The volume of _Plutarchs Lives_ which I possessed contained the
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book
had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I
learned from Werters imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch
taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many
things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book
developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
have been imbued with different sensations.",the volume of plutarchs lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations,1485,249,5.2,1.142309516819804,1.1366120218579236,1.142309516819804,0.36374346129421425,5.2,1.1819842181000135,1.1304347826086958,1.1819842181000135,0.36539064838136914,61.3736694924138,0.9839223848213132,0.6894764442771988,0.9839223848213132,0.23281335076432413,-0.822916666666667,-0.19399376633210394,-0.26152433425160676,-0.19399376633210394,0.012667027818641926,10.227000000000002,1.967611107530858,2.021408643170301,1.967611107530858,0.41185758133370703,51.55485280591775,1.3371362416142105,1.473375311435574,1.3371362416142105,0.45105426193529125,2.4922327357316645,1.2284998480792424,1.1598279565385412,1.2284998480792424,0.38113763692113745,"{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9913}",0.9913,1.2801586007921462,0.6235081374321881,1.2801586007921462,0.26163337716795293,0.1416315868040006,0.30069902087176,0.3178163180066196,0.30069902087176,-0.0011113521708022232,0.8009685654938233,2.0351723060385623,1.9914179872220639,2.0351723060385623,0.5937101520486489,45.92828898705496,2.081872370282774,1.7604497801878534,2.081872370282774,-0.6948977784026649,0.991,1.2015531454744313,0.8814283339088619,1.2015531454744313,0.37367604174391256

it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity
struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to
any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a
perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
gall of envy rose within me.",but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me,942,170,7.250000000000001,1.6114054986869684,1.584699453551913,1.6114054986869684,0.7428143478522402,5.75,1.309712074200213,1.25,1.309712074200213,0.5917964488914312,130.3823794421438,1.8549548922130354,1.4647255104288905,1.8549548922130354,0.7244278190142288,4.277083333333333,2.32076731288504,2.256161616161616,2.32076731288504,1.1055300665157626,7.1379999999999955,1.2255946867920329,1.317884188350508,1.2255946867920329,0.42903542192481203,59.461679788026856,1.562762623572469,1.6993428592644566,1.562762623572469,0.7619857314723194,4.774820937164356,2.3735743404637604,2.2220921549539603,2.3735743404637604,1.069549172450245,"{'neg': 0.122, 'neu': 0.575, 'pos': 0.303, 'compound': 0.9931}",0.9931,1.2825749568020564,0.6246403019105277,1.2825749568020564,0.38391178909161483,0.26666666666666666,0.8742440029466476,0.8771091141972508,0.8742440029466476,0.4445503830079072,1.08826648935167,2.94640791605385,2.8045676868196385,2.94640791605385,1.4804537216737945,34.37871074758336,1.1326376171282113,1.0189463038170368,1.1326376171282113,-0.372985149058557,0.5062,0.6758171867958556,0.6334139073271178,0.6758171867958556,0.3283595838612624

after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had
neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.
Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. Hateful
day when I received life! I exclaimed in agony. Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the

389,389,15,"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I
postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.

their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from
me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a

and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his

of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,
earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents
now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I
often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived

436,436,16,"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was
secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding
that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of
these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and

towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides
of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the

from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She
was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On
seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I
hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my

answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed
under a banas if I had no right to claim their sympathiesas if
never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I
loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate

I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was
material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
fathers consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My
father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.",day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart,1590,279,4.9,1.0736613243514388,1.0710382513661205,1.0736613243514388,0.3059025345499523,4.9,1.1123144784089958,1.065217391304348,1.1123144784089958,0.3072877930039347,45.24060003971104,0.7802897137056076,0.5082363220306135,0.7802897137056076,0.15316138732650267,-0.03750000000000009,0.19328765804079792,0.12620752984389372,0.19328765804079792,0.1343952970816903,3.388999999999999,0.32503801429289164,0.4640437282924325,0.32503801429289164,-0.13061406219145688,38.38473999167372,0.9613186208437435,1.096989423139505,0.9613186208437435,0.2997181108133736,2.442764380895175,1.2036837418416229,1.1368065187407246,1.2036837418416229,0.33340335310848607,"{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.758, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9885}",0.9885,1.2763998247767305,0.6217469926881045,1.2763998247767305,0.2328412158513832,0.14727564102564103,0.32658870703772225,0.34306266383964495,0.32658870703772225,-0.01935629790913116,0.6787844198663203,1.6476354140902443,1.645595782945537,1.6476354140902443,0.37547242683964893,49.55322029815927,2.3797976024387633,1.9931768212154775,2.3797976024387633,-0.8187762338624756,0.7007,0.8867405448053088,0.7329163948893067,0.8867405448053088,0.30728197109606475

becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,

as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the
bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man. I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes
of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;
but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
our own country.",we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairy land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would because a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water spout must be on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country,1991,366,2.2000000000000006,0.45582759213614943,0.4808743169398909,0.45582759213614943,0.10469665200555413,1.2000000000000004,0.25305435555310835,0.2608695652173914,0.25305435555310835,0.057365871025826576,14.475796092064028,0.3919743207435547,0.1626221879868493,0.3919743207435547,0.03735824877918763,-3.3467261904761902,-1.4384600333583284,-1.507438016528925,-1.4384600333583284,-0.21152398799363845,6.834,1.1525700859812207,1.2486477253316628,1.1525700859812207,-0.008239548558250267,-18.85833768695016,-0.6721493351400727,-0.5389484723633632,-0.6721493351400727,-0.11224859388133214,2.3301941973968066,1.1472122128789657,1.0844189371067199,1.1472122128789657,0.2424396335629803,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9838}",0.9838,1.2700904507508541,0.6187907854391069,1.2700904507508541,0.17664978812389148,0.3120772946859903,1.0825458480125227,1.0802348061998168,1.0825458480125227,0.12542007266294425,1.2128552189568669,3.3415715340095264,3.157195672052962,3.3415715340095264,0.6207373552641245,62.74880088704258,3.4643137140498523,2.840356577611144,3.4643137140498523,-0.9304213349633471,0.9998,1.2110962074306433,0.8859302459425239,1.2110962074306433,0.31723913448915875

were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles
I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,

Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than
mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have

followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.

extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I

The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of
darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound
as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but
the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations

549,550,20,"I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and
the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found
that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I
confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me
and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the
wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already
been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the
sea; it was to be my grave. Fiend, I exclaimed, your
task is already fulfilled! I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
of Clervalall left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his

magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oclock,
they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the
light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother in law daniel nugent when about ten of the clock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck,1375,260,-2.65,-0.6539848527690926,-0.5792349726775957,-0.6539848527690926,-0.1775267181471799,-2.65,-0.6410406371482882,-0.5760869565217391,-0.6410406371482882,-0.17833063560240117,-60.82772140201279,-0.5585116643743108,-0.6833432221439492,-0.5585116643743108,-0.22098018788742885,2.229166666666667,1.3109592488039734,1.245179063360882,1.3109592488039734,0.46873772247231466,4.811999999999998,0.6668604055882446,0.7881341456470982,0.6668604055882446,-0.01132346808395968,6.4201545175696655,0.04918866180500138,0.18348024767714832,0.04918866180500138,0.05379361361706375,-1.5856378971071257,-0.8171891824593235,-0.7379195111454621,-0.8171891824593235,-0.23223263875367597,"{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': -0.987}",-0.987,-1.3755508960996052,-0.6208035222894883,-1.3755508960996052,-0.24947739050092582,0.04472222222222223,-0.14383126481281683,-0.11566770546529097,-0.14383126481281683,-0.1779776047670202,0.16111854644237095,0.005731526935907568,0.1804273479836504,0.005731526935907568,-0.12938151072821316,45.63113503897173,2.057449932622349,1.7413719679117305,2.057449932622349,-0.856908359629176,-0.9975,-0.9548535249718308,-0.13585031142488077,-0.9548535249718308,0.020265014569796017

shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest
companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I
repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on

found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I
could continue my journey. My fathers care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt
attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right
to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose

your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my
own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now
I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who
have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured

made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you

the fiend_I will be with you on your
wedding-night!_ Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
dmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he
had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,

softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angels arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make
her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
fathers happiness, my adversarys designs against my life
should not retard it a single hour.",sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed to be with me on my wedding night yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour,1073,191,-4.3500000000000005,-1.042991276756497,-0.9508196721311478,-1.042991276756497,-0.3966861962352278,-4.3500000000000005,-1.0358358287307232,-0.9456521739130437,-1.0358358287307232,-0.39848256221735806,-95.88500898971758,-1.0010070701298373,-1.0771794420063054,-1.0010070701298373,-0.4741791833500633,-0.6270833333333334,-0.09743022815955009,-0.16484848484848455,-0.09743022815955009,0.013501236070626805,5.417000000000001,0.8121889697018705,0.9259238171155266,0.8121889697018705,0.1734722844018524,-19.662467048818694,-0.695095682512455,-0.5619295165230227,-0.695095682512455,-0.22426589161855345,-0.5599631528686729,-0.30265310171848053,-0.260594008744486,-0.30265310171848053,-0.11163970257143327,"{'neg': 0.21, 'neu': 0.636, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': -0.9637}",-0.9637,-1.3442725099713242,-0.6061482820976493,-1.3442725099713242,-0.331585766369574,0.2788265306122449,0.9300221810096359,0.9315012441090321,0.9300221810096359,0.39605274678475355,0.48477905498157126,1.032299964940028,1.096495385497458,1.032299964940028,0.404760551601002,36.5842593207533,1.3139068645426644,1.1605464471643512,1.3139068645426644,-0.566513646595318,-0.9966,-0.9538775299990365,-0.13538988860325626,-0.9538775299990365,-0.04218698356140299

mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were

rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,

sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the
spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dmon who caused this misery,
until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun
and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering

sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most
miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was
sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeths
voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by
a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the
destruction of the dmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the
ardent desire of my soul.",my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul,1310,238,3.7000000000000006,0.7990685544779768,0.8087431693989073,0.7990685544779768,0.27077961448800875,3.7000000000000006,0.8336355196449243,0.8043478260869568,0.8336355196449243,0.272005821229602,30.901056226461485,0.5992950419952275,0.3471448024476354,0.5992950419952275,0.12263699645365579,-0.8988095238095235,-0.23141580620140637,-0.2989898989898985,-0.23141580620140637,-0.0054406607200208675,9.89,1.8866594941320287,1.94465637988954,1.8866594941320287,0.42090334697194665,64.63175451691514,1.71029402373746,1.8470973391869865,1.71029402373746,0.5915991960521629,2.6919008207684127,1.328664578176129,1.252748903982139,1.328664578176129,0.43069981547245606,"{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.689, 'pos': 0.223, 'compound': 0.989}",0.989,1.2770710347794834,0.6220614828209766,1.2770710347794834,0.27309058173655876,0.35,1.25650004841328,1.2498663681381301,1.25650004841328,0.4008504477638409,0.6384215972423066,1.5196148534058918,1.5313554269732237,1.5196148534058918,0.44494696826671004,43.60879329644829,1.8912380567464184,1.611534029123106,1.8912380567464184,-0.7170036344896038,-0.8074,-0.7487016979404834,-0.038598779879522704,-0.7487016979404834,0.04034448787920842

the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to
discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
not intercept the view I had of the dmon; but still my sight was
dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
oppressed me, I wept aloud.",by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud,1065,192,-9.4,-2.198569183307316,-2.05464480874317,-2.198569183307316,-0.8527423332384193,-9.4,-2.2086097801961913,-2.0434782608695654,-2.2086097801961913,-0.8566039178700245,-207.57852628621282,-2.4108100428420896,-2.331952861801912,-2.4108100428420896,-1.0211894841369862,-5.939042857142857,-2.7167065153856336,-2.7871712029384748,-2.7167065153856336,-1.0480764424529014,-1.5700000000000016,-0.8661757864335011,-0.6653760747024997,-0.8661757864335011,-0.5117751905253288,-52.41539925782906,-1.6297216215350756,-1.4979686877635552,-1.6297216215350756,-0.594725083752295,-2.7971035938332194,-1.4249284439034968,-1.3017078617698918,-1.4249284439034968,-0.5547533205083298,"{'neg': 0.158, 'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.9329}",-0.9329,-1.3029259738017513,-0.5867756899127291,-1.3029259738017513,-0.319316420632607,0.030519480519480512,-0.20898027134970573,-0.1791978054118383,-0.20898027134970573,-0.18379580439551294,0.0636703985416621,-0.3033491002568571,-0.09538366773050726,-0.3033491002568571,-0.20958816656098195,35.243505282298564,1.2037132018525376,1.0744676519166834,1.2037132018525376,-0.7110332292561169,-0.9512,-0.904644005815853,-0.11216411515686353,-0.904644005815853,-0.030267096635282653

some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had
completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But
this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes
are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot
recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod
heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once

718,719,24,"I thank you, Walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our
infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of
Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive

729,730,24,"What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,
so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was
smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this
was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the
benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,
behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it

742,743,24,"His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat
by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but
presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
said, Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I
have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was
bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I
know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may
render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was

abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I
knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not
disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no

Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of
virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no
malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the
frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
