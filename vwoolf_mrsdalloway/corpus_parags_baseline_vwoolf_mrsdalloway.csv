The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven--over. It was June. The King and Queen were at the Palace. And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party. But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!",for it was the middle of june  the war was over  except for some one like mrs  foxcroft at the embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old manor house must go to a cousin  or lady bexborough who opened a bazaar  they said  with the telegram in her hand  john  her favourite  killed  but it was over  thank heaven  over  it was june  the king and queen were at the palace  and everywhere  though it was still so early  there was a beating  a stirring of galloping ponies  tapping of cricket bats  lords  ascot  ranelagh and all the rest of it  wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey blue morning air  which  as the day wore on  would unwind them  and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies  whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung  the whirling young men  and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who  even now  after dancing all night  were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run  and even now  at this hour  discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery  and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds  their lovely old sea green brooches in eighteenth century settings to tempt americans  but one must economise  not buy things rashly for elizabeth   and she  too  loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion  being part of it  since her people were courtiers once in the time of the georges  she  too  was going that very night to kindle and illuminate  to give her party  but how strange  on entering the park  the silence  the mist  the hum  the slow swimming happy ducks  the pouched birds waddling  and who should be coming along with his back against the government buildings  most appropriately  carrying a despatch box stamped with the royal arms  who but hugh whitbread  her old friend hugh  the admirable hugh ,1893,331,1.3,0.2538974855148219,0.4999999999999999,0.2538974855148219,0.035251748889198985,2.3,0.5669935980476734,0.8723404255319148,0.5669935980476734,0.07895432499419153,58.650313212442704,1.0659620493740545,1.1331759833075183,1.0659620493740545,0.25443390408294514,5.042857142857144,2.6458568969065626,3.4400000000000004,2.6458568969065626,0.4078712611808447,11.067000000000005,2.2749951149254706,2.88793227148802,2.2749951149254706,0.21115408225423704,44.24755565958395,1.5062519543037949,1.9083286665820025,1.5062519543037949,0.29433799003249145,2.5337482897570163,1.5312666645649688,1.9028581960351705,1.5312666645649688,0.4675436064191362,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915,1.2994799708503528,0.8182786240103708,1.2994799708503528,0.0963314635632436,0.08312757201646089,-0.07074600359357243,0.13041727601258268,-0.07074600359357243,-0.06986254687612288,0.3849764182185987,0.5466969637124838,0.7972382618914455,0.5466969637124838,-0.02302081553869926,57.43162790115903,2.7226882538667723,2.2943223913187096,2.7226882538667723,-0.5821288001234395,0.5434,0.8939642469288536,0.7394192848257061,0.8939642469288536,0.2385818308107436

Devonshire House, Bath House, the house with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton--such hosts of people; and dancing all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and driving home across the Park. She remembered once throwing a shilling into the Serpentine. But every one remembered; what she loved was this, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab.

Year in year out she wore that coat; she perspired; she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were; how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal from school during the War--poor embittered unfortunate creature! For it was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would have loved Miss Kilman!

Tall men, men of robust physique, well-dressed men with their tail-coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who, for reasons difficult to discriminate, were standing in the bow window of Brooks's with their hands behind the tails of their coats, looking out, perceived instinctively that greatness was passing, and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon Clarissa Dalloway. At once they stood even straighter, and removed their hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereign, if need be, to the cannon's mouth, as their ancestors had done before them. The white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the Tatler and syphons of soda water seemed to approve; seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of England; and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral. Shawled Moll Pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well (it was the Prince of Wales for certain) and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer--a bunch of roses--into St. James's Street out of sheer light-heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable's eye upon her, discouraging an old Irishwoman's loyalty.

70,70,1,"There was nobody. Her words faded. So a rocket fades. Its sparks, having grazed their way into the night, surrender to it, dark descends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers; bleak hillsides soften and fall in. But though they are gone, the night is full of them; robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more ponderously, give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit--the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness; huddled together in the darkness; reft of the relief which dawn brings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each window-pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red-brown cows peacefully grazing, all is once more decked out to the eye; exists again.

For she was only nineteen and had got her way at last, to come to London; and now how queer it was, this couple she had asked the way of, and the girl started and jerked her hand, and the man--he seemed awfully odd; quarrelling, perhaps; parting for ever, perhaps; something was up, she knew; and now all these people (for she returned to the Broad Walk), the stone basins, the prim flowers, the old men and women, invalids most of them in Bath chairs--all seemed, after Edinburgh, so queer.

102,102,2,"Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom. There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. Women must put off their rich apparel. At midday they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and narrower would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot's Memoirs. She had read late at night of the retreat from Moscow. For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed. And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew it. So the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment--for example on the river beneath the woods at Clieveden--when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at Constantinople, and again and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it was not mind. It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together. For that she could dimly perceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly. And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident--like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over--the moment. Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore!

It was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired, dark, large-eyed, with that quality which, since she hadn't got it herself, she always envied--a sort of abandonment, as if she could say anything, do anything; a quality much commoner in foreigners than in Englishwomen. Sally always said she had French blood in her veins, an ancestor had been with Marie Antoinette, had his head cut off, left a ruby ring. Perhaps that summer she came to stay at Bourton, walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket, one night after dinner, and upsetting poor Aunt Helena to such an extent that she never forgave her. There had been some quarrel at home. She literally hadn't a penny that night when she came to them--had pawned a brooch to come down. She had rushed off in a passion. They sat up till all hours of the night talking. Sally it was who made her feel, for the first time, how sheltered the life at Bourton was. She knew nothing about sex--nothing about social problems. She had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field--she had seen cows just after their calves were born. But Aunt Helena never liked discussion of anything (when Sally gave her William Morris, it had to be wrapped in brown paper). There they sat, hour after hour, talking in her bedroom at the top of the house, talking about life, how they were to reform the world. They meant to found a society to abolish private property, and actually had a letter written, though not sent out. The ideas were Sally's, of course--but very soon she was just as excited--read Plato in bed before breakfast; read Morris; read Shelley by the hour.",she sat on the floor  that was her first impression of sally  she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees  smoking a cigarette  where could it have been  the mannings  the kinloch jones own  at some party  where  she could not be certain   for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with   who is that   and he had told her  and said that sally own parents did not get on  how that shocked her  that one own parents should quarrel    but all that evening she could not take her eyes off sally  it was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired  dark  large eyed  with that quality which  since she had not got it herself  she always envied  a sort of abandonment  as if she could say anything  do anything  a quality much commoner in foreigners than in englishwomen  sally always said she had french blood in her veins  an ancestor had been with marie antoinette  had his head cut off  left a ruby ring  perhaps that summer she came to stay at bourton  walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket  one night after dinner  and upsetting poor aunt helena to such an extent that she never forgave her  there had been some quarrel at home  she literally had not a penny that night when she came to them  had pawned a brooch to come down  she had rushed off in a passion  they sat up till all hours of the night talking  sally it was who made her feel  for the first time  how sheltered the life at bourton was  she knew nothing about sex  nothing about social problems  she had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field  she had seen cows just after their calves were born  but aunt helena never liked discussion of anything  when sally gave her william morris  it had to be wrapped in brown paper   there they sat  hour after hour  talking in her bedroom at the top of the house  talking about life  how they were to reform the world  they meant to found a society to abolish private property  and actually had a letter written  though not sent out  the ideas were sally own  of course  but very soon she was just as excited  read plato in bed before breakfast  read morris  read shelley by the hour ,2153,386,4.0,1.2256376353419345,1.6739130434782608,1.2256376353419345,0.2016400451579337,1.7999999999999998,0.38400597787844143,0.6595744680851063,0.38400597787844143,0.015156369544171969,-14.287884897214449,-0.28431078501823825,-0.2760545874519005,-0.28431078501823825,-0.053151224973943985,1.2895833333333342,0.4619972087897281,0.7710052910052915,0.4619972087897281,-0.08608199389399003,13.282999999999992,2.830100301845743,3.52389151958674,2.830100301845743,0.22847953272562874,62.50415433101288,2.2899287649412714,2.8388527016399445,2.2899287649412714,0.3980711622043072,1.3117040845964347,0.6848585048206605,0.985096616833434,0.6848585048206605,0.2075559624910435,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.3782}",-0.3782,-0.9000897997435904,-0.4500208342978841,-0.9000897997435904,-0.2345408648116124,0.1440220174091142,0.1999604054514436,0.4319027586836533,0.1999604054514436,-0.016821412674914264,0.8927840199971379,2.027261184538259,2.1968364170288,2.027261184538259,0.2473311376957109,65.58520422982174,3.284260524443644,2.717893811708964,3.284260524443644,-0.6101798853928838,0.7166,1.0898238856548754,0.8311055821709326,1.0898238856548754,0.2452977644880047

189,189,3,"Ah, said St. Margaret's, like a hostess who comes into her drawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says. Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present. It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret's glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest--like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking? Then, as the sound of St. Margaret's languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed languor and suffering. It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is not dead!

Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it's strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when civilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security. Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought. And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one's life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through.

Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one--spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him. Yet even then he admired her for it. He admired her courage; her social instinct; he admired her power of carrying things through. ""The perfect hostess,"" he said to her, whereupon she winced all over. But he meant her to feel it. He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with Dalloway. So she left him. And he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him--laughing and talking--behind his back. There he stood by Miss Parry's chair as though he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers. Never, never had he suffered so infernally! He must have forgotten even to pretend to listen; at last he woke up; he saw Miss Parry looking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes fixed.

244,244,6,"She frowned; she stamped her foot. She must go back again to Septimus since it was almost time for them to be going to Sir William Bradshaw. She must go back and tell him, go back to him sitting there on the green chair under the tree, talking to himself, or to that dead man Evans, whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop. He had seemed a nice quiet man; a great friend of Septimus's, and he had been killed in the War. But such things happen to every one. Every one has friends who were killed in the War. Every one gives up something when they marry. She had given up her home. She had come to live here, in this awful city. But Septimus let himself think about horrible things, as she could too, if she tried. He had grown stranger and stranger. He said people were talking behind the bedroom walls. Mrs. Filmer thought it odd. He saw things too--he had seen an old woman's head in the middle of a fern. Yet he could be happy when he chose. They went to Hampton Court on top of a bus, and they were perfectly happy. All the little red and yellow flowers were out on the grass, like floating lamps he said, and talked and chattered and laughed, making up stories. Suddenly he said, ""Now we will kill ourselves,"" when they were standing by the river, and he looked at it with a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by, or an omnibus--a look as if something fascinated him; and she felt he was going from her and she caught him by the arm. But going home he was perfectly quiet--perfectly reasonable.

264,264,6,"This susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt. Still at his age he had, like a boy or a girl even, these alternations of mood; good days, bad days, for no reason whatever, happiness from a pretty face, downright misery at the sight of a frump. After India of course one fell in love with every woman one met. There was a freshness about them; even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely; and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming; the long black cloaks; the slimness; the elegance; and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint.

One of the things he remembered best was an argument one Sunday morning at Bourton about women's rights (that antediluvian topic), when Sally suddenly lost her temper, flared up, and told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in British middle-class life. She told him that she considered him responsible for the state of ""those poor girls in Piccadilly""--Hugh, the perfect gentleman, poor Hugh!--never did a man look more horrified! She did it on purpose she said afterwards (for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes). ""He's read nothing, thought nothing, felt nothing,"" he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew. The stable boys had more life in them than Hugh, she said. He was a perfect specimen of the public school type, she said. No country but England could have produced him. She was really spiteful, for some reason; had some grudge against him. Something had happened--he forgot what--in the smoking-room. He had insulted her--kissed her? Incredible! Nobody believed a word against Hugh of course. Who could? Kissing Sally in the smoking-room! If it had been some Honourable Edith or Lady Violet, perhaps; but not that ragamuffin Sally without a penny to her name, and a father or a mother gambling at Monte Carlo. For of all the people he had ever met Hugh was the greatest snob--the most obsequious--no, he didn't cringe exactly. He was too much of a prig for that. A first-rate valet was the obvious comparison--somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases; could be trusted to send telegrams--indispensable to hostesses. And he'd found his job--married his Honourable Evelyn; got some little post at Court, looked after the King's cellars, polished the Imperial shoe-buckles, went about in knee-breeches and lace ruffles.

There was a garden where they used to walk, a walled-in place, with rose-bushes and giant cauliflowers--he could remember Sally tearing off a rose, stopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the moonlight (it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him, things he hadn't thought of for years,) while she implored him, half laughing of course, to carry off Clarissa, to save her from the Hughs and the Dalloways and all the other ""perfect gentlemen"" who would ""stifle her soul"" (she wrote reams of poetry in those days), make a mere hostess of her, encourage her worldliness. But one must do Clarissa justice. She wasn't going to marry Hugh anyhow. She had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted. Her emotions were all on the surface. Beneath, she was very shrewd--a far better judge of character than Sally, for instance, and with it all, purely feminine; with that extraordinary gift, that woman's gift, of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be. She came into a room; she stood, as he had often seen her, in a doorway with lots of people round her. But it was Clarissa one remembered.

He only felt, after seeing her that morning, among her scissors and silks, making ready for the party, unable to get away from the thought of her; she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage; which was not being in love, of course; it was thinking of her, criticising her, starting again, after thirty years, trying to explain her. The obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly; cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world--which was true in a sense; she had admitted it to him. (You could always get her to own up if you took the trouble; she was honest.) What she would say was that she hated frumps, fogies, failures, like himself presumably; thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets; must do something, be something; and these great swells, these Duchesses, these hoary old Countesses one met in her drawing-room, unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw, stood for something real to her. Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright (so did Clarissa herself; she never lounged in any sense of the word; she was straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact). She said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected. In all this there was a great deal of Dalloway, of course; a great deal of the public-spirited, British Empire, tariff-reform, governing-class spirit, which had grown on her, as it tends to do. With twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes--one of the tragedies of married life. With a mind of her own, she must always be quoting Richard--as if one couldn't know to a tittle what Richard thought by reading the Morning Post of a morning! These parties for example were all for him, or for her idea of him (to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in Norfolk). She made her drawing-room a sort of meeting-place; she had a genius for it. Over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth, twist him, turn him, wake him up; set him going. Infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course. But odd unexpected people turned up; an artist sometimes; sometimes a writer; queer fish in that atmosphere. And behind it all was that network of visiting, leaving cards, being kind to people; running about with bunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going to France--must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength; all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct.",no  no  no  he was not in love with her any more  he only felt  after seeing her that morning  among her scissors and silks  making ready for the party  unable to get away from the thought of her  she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage  which was not being in love  of course  it was thinking of her  criticising her  starting again  after thirty years  trying to explain her  the obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly  cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world  which was true in a sense  she had admitted it to him   you could always get her to own up if you took the trouble  she was honest   what she would say was that she hated frumps  fogies  failures  like himself presumably  thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets  must do something  be something  and these great swells  these duchesses  these hoary old countesses one met in her drawing room  unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw  stood for something real to her  lady bexborough  she said once  held herself upright  so did clarissa herself  she never lounged in any sense of the word  she was straight as a dart  a little rigid in fact   she said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected  in all this there was a great deal of dalloway  of course  a great deal of the public spirited  british empire  tariff reform  governing class spirit  which had grown on her  as it tends to do  with twice his wits  she had to see things through his eyes  one of the tragedies of married life  with a mind of her own  she must always be quoting richard  as if one could not know to a tittle what richard thought by reading the morning post of a morning  these parties for example were all for him  or for her idea of him  to do richard justice he would have been happier farming in norfolk   she made her drawing room a sort of meeting place  she had a genius for it  over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth  twist him  turn him  wake him up  set him going  infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course  but odd unexpected people turned up  an artist sometimes  sometimes a writer  queer fish in that atmosphere  and behind it all was that network of visiting  leaving cards  being kind to people  running about with bunches of flowers  little presents  so and so was going to france  must have an air cushion  a real drain on her strength  all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up  but she did it genuinely  from a natural instinct ,2639,475,10.95,3.726968761748761,4.695652173913042,3.726968761748761,0.5297505056562679,13.95,4.830605147990777,5.829787234042553,4.830605147990777,0.7048047704341982,55.614549542705916,1.0097622895620844,1.0745223411848808,1.0097622895620844,0.16812312513667868,2.7133928571428565,1.2904473513597805,1.7834920634920632,1.2904473513597805,0.012403458275421777,24.303000000000008,5.590596312613538,6.686468646864692,5.590596312613538,0.5255922507353717,129.69077250864484,5.173959662403258,6.263300167113759,5.173959662403258,0.8060547449801653,3.1784564276857314,1.9778022532875703,2.3870373740804682,1.9778022532875703,0.4087043878118049,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.9368}",0.9368,1.2116384972054022,0.7676281309319875,1.2116384972054022,0.011162798471754706,0.13466015466015466,0.15834222122459615,0.3855526245889776,0.15834222122459615,-0.05579297956683335,1.0460979020959675,2.474263253031164,2.619393751324176,2.474263253031164,0.2213266018671249,78.50787376383758,4.1743009900759915,3.389215605866338,4.1743009900759915,-0.6462617087035972,-0.9995,-0.8507923153712564,-0.07734046213705302,-0.8507923153712564,0.12145423581089072
276,276,6,"Oddly enough, she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had ever met, and possibly (this was a theory he used to make up to account for her, so transparent in some ways, so inscrutable in others), possibly she said to herself, As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship (her favourite reading as a girl was Huxley and Tyndall, and they were fond of these nautical metaphors), as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part; mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners (Huxley again); decorate the dungeon with flowers and air-cushions; be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods, shan't have it all their own way,--her notion being that the Gods, who never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady. That phase came directly after Sylvia's death--that horrible affair. To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all Justin Parry's fault--all his carelessness) before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one bitter.

277,277,6,"And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to enjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years, could make of Clarissa). Anyhow there was no bitterness in her; none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women. She enjoyed practically everything. If you walked with her in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator, now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment. (Very likely, she would have talked to those lovers, if she had thought them unhappy.) She had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite, but she needed people, always people, to bring it out, with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away, lunching, dining, giving these incessant parties of hers, talking nonsense, sayings things she didn't mean, blunting the edge of her mind, losing her discrimination. There she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to Dalloway--they knew the most appalling bores in Europe--or in came Elizabeth and everything must give way to her. She was at a High School, at the inarticulate stage last time he was over, a round-eyed, pale-faced girl, with nothing of her mother in her, a silent stolid creature, who took it all as a matter of course, let her mother make a fuss of her, and then said ""May I go now?"" like a child of four; going off, Clarissa explained, with that mixture of amusement and pride which Dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her, to play hockey. And now Elizabeth was ""out,"" presumably; thought him an old fogy, laughed at her mother's friends. Ah well, so be it. The compensation of growing old, Peter Walsh thought, coming out of Regent's Park, and holding his hat in hand, was simply this; that the passions remain as strong as ever, but one has gained--at last!--the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence,--the power of taking hold of experience, of turning it round, slowly, in the light.",and of course she enjoyed life immensely  it was her nature to enjoy  though goodness only knows  she had her reserves  it was a mere sketch  he often felt  that even he  after all these years  could make of clarissa   anyhow there was no bitterness in her  none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women  she enjoyed practically everything  if you walked with her in hyde park now it was a bed of tulips  now a child in a perambulator  now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment   very likely  she would have talked to those lovers  if she had thought them unhappy   she had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite  but she needed people  always people  to bring it out  with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away  lunching  dining  giving these incessant parties of hers  talking nonsense  sayings things she did not mean  blunting the edge of her mind  losing her discrimination  there she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to dalloway  they knew the most appalling bores in europe  or in came elizabeth and everything must give way to her  she was at a high school  at the inarticulate stage last time he was over  a round eyed  pale faced girl  with nothing of her mother in her  a silent stolid creature  who took it all as a matter of course  let her mother make a fuss of her  and then said  may i go now   like a child of four  going off  clarissa explained  with that mixture of amusement and pride which dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her  to play hockey  and now elizabeth was  out   presumably  thought him an old fogy  laughed at her mother own friends  ah well  so be it  the compensation of growing old  peter walsh thought  coming out of regent own park  and holding his hat in hand  was simply this  that the passions remain as strong as ever  but one has gained  at last   the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence   the power of taking hold of experience  of turning it round  slowly  in the light ,2063,368,5.75,1.8554692139335816,2.434782608695652,1.8554692139335816,0.3377019900246718,5.75,1.8296081772153736,2.3404255319148937,1.8296081772153736,0.3211557797095944,-14.419830667808142,-0.2867534391317628,-0.27860389657143064,-0.2867534391317628,-0.056265862651760735,3.288933333333334,1.6253282336558197,2.1927652910052915,1.6253282336558197,0.14632915142357195,-0.7280000000000021,-0.6796374120260812,-0.4970584014923238,-0.6796374120260812,-0.41692372095344143,37.65321517885802,1.223185441795065,1.5722204778056348,1.223185441795065,0.17918310743183902,3.645465734257386,2.301260673277245,2.737763801889836,2.301260673277245,0.6050508138314686,"{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.9935}",0.9935,1.3026917249141534,0.820130561600074,1.3026917249141534,0.0717161773087462,0.11394675925925928,0.06626077024906234,0.28300159600289443,0.06626077024906234,-0.044424531641102286,0.6784533417441204,1.4023584998692529,1.6061071313276287,1.4023584998692529,0.13699144021102128,63.132838397821104,3.115355421572348,2.5904954730038416,3.115355421572348,-0.5973468555578613,-0.9667,-0.8137011135801853,-0.059977237235647525,-0.8137011135801853,0.10511061294642486

What could Clarissa have thought of him? thought him a fool presumably, not for the first time. It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it--jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought, holding his pocket-knife at arm's length. She had been meeting Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him; and yet it made no difference; he was furious! All this pother of coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she might have spared him, what she had reduced him to--a whimpering, snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket-knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle.

301,301,6,"Septimus was one of the first to volunteer. He went to France to save an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare's plays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square. There in the trenches the change which Mr. Brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly; he developed manliness; he was promoted; he drew the attention, indeed the affection of his officer, Evans by name. It was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth-rug; one worrying a paper screw, snarling, snapping, giving a pinch, now and then, at the old dog's ear; the other lying somnolent, blinking at the fire, raising a paw, turning and growling good-temperedly. They had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other. But when Evans (Rezia who had only seen him once called him ""a quiet man,"" a sturdy red-haired man, undemonstrative in the company of women), when Evans was killed, just before the Armistice, in Italy, Septimus, far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship, congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably. The War had taught him. It was sublime. He had gone through the whole show, friendship, European War, death, had won promotion, was still under thirty and was bound to survive. He was right there. The last shells missed him. He watched them explode with indifference. When peace came he was in Milan, billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard, flowers in tubs, little tables in the open, daughters making hats, and to Lucrezia, the younger daughter, he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him--that he could not feel.",septimus was one of the first to volunteer  he went to france to save an england which consisted almost entirely of shakespeare own plays and miss isabel pole in a green dress walking in a square  there in the trenches the change which mr  brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly  he developed manliness  he was promoted  he drew the attention  indeed the affection of his officer  evans by name  it was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth rug  one worrying a paper screw  snarling  snapping  giving a pinch  now and then  at the old dog own ear  the other lying somnolent  blinking at the fire  raising a paw  turning and growling good temperedly  they had to be together  share with each other  fight with each other  quarrel with each other  but when evans  rezia who had only seen him once called him  a quiet man   a sturdy red haired man  undemonstrative in the company of women   when evans was killed  just before the armistice  in italy  septimus  far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship  congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably  the war had taught him  it was sublime  he had gone through the whole show  friendship  european war  death  had won promotion  was still under thirty and was bound to survive  he was right there  the last shells missed him  he watched them explode with indifference  when peace came he was in milan  billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard  flowers in tubs  little tables in the open  daughters making hats  and to lucrezia  the younger daughter  he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him  that he could not feel ,1673,287,3.45,1.0276905677845598,1.434782608695652,1.0276905677845598,0.24451469199281084,5.4499999999999975,1.7198156051138338,2.212765957446808,1.7198156051138338,0.4150774510719548,-14.969673068779304,-0.2969324300647744,-0.2892273386173034,-0.2969324300647744,-0.07489676484646801,0.692857142857143,0.11478932086059815,0.3466666666666666,0.11478932086059815,-0.12456863062097565,3.401999999999999,0.3549223451854412,0.6881905581862532,0.3549223451854412,-0.1716057179141657,44.642365709511175,1.5231994419658206,1.9284518147845569,1.5231994419658206,0.374645187312486,-0.3460104282837507,-0.4633021626111503,-0.2598556383974965,-0.4633021626111503,-0.07363663581615049,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': -0.7132}",-0.7132,-1.4380586054302158,-0.7602203805731745,-1.4380586054302158,-0.3598250134730407,0.0717101648351648,-0.12150211572701718,0.0738902398812957,-0.12150211572701718,-0.07041894801228372,0.3973015303844721,0.5826320698955041,0.8312082225395344,0.5826320698955041,0.02900094038423437,51.55555381427885,2.3179774700298537,1.989065293454953,2.3179774700298537,-0.5343849443667752,0.9838,1.391981480733357,0.9725523411238456,1.391981480733357,0.2944325353368076

314,314,6,"He watched her snip, shape, as one watches a bird hop, flit in the grass, without daring to move a finger. For the truth is (let her ignore it) that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment. They hunt in packs. Their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the wilderness. They desert the fallen. They are plastered over with grimaces. There was Brewer at the office, with his waxed moustache, coral tie-pin, white slip, and pleasurable emotions--all coldness and clamminess within,--his geraniums ruined in the War--his cook's nerves destroyed; or Amelia What'shername, handing round cups of tea punctually at five--a leering, sneering obscene little harpy; and the Toms and Berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick drops of vice.

Conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace. At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching; shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own. This lady too (Rezia Warren Smith divined it) had her dwelling in Sir William's heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice. How he would work--how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions! But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will. For example, Lady Bradshaw. Fifteen years ago she had gone under. It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water-logged, of her will into his. Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane. Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe--that the poor lady lied. Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely: now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband's eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head (which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, ""is not his own but his patients'"") disagreeable it was: so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients.",but proportion has a sister  less smiling  more formidable  a goddess even now engaged  in the heat and sands of india  the mud and swamp of africa  the purlieus of london  wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own  is even now engaged in dashing down shrines  smashing idols  and setting up in their place her own stern countenance  conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly  loving to impress  to impose  adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace  at hyde park corner on a tub she stands preaching  shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments  offers help  but desires power  smites out of her way roughly the dissentient  or dissatisfied  bestows her blessing on those who  looking upward  catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own  this lady too  rezia warren smith divined it  had her dwelling in sir william own heart  though concealed  as she mostly is  under some plausible disguise  some venerable name  love  duty  self sacrifice  how he would work  how toil to raise funds  propagate reforms  initiate institutions  but conversion  fastidious goddess  loves blood better than brick  and feasts most subtly on the human will  for example  lady bradshaw  fifteen years ago she had gone under  it was nothing you could put your finger on  there had been no scene  no snap  only the slow sinking  water logged  of her will into his  sweet was her smile  swift her submission  dinner in harley street  numbering eight or nine courses  feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes  was smooth and urbane  only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness  or uneasiness perhaps  a nervous twitch  fumble  stumble and confusion indicated  what it was really painful to believe  that the poor lady lied  once  long ago  she had caught salmon freely  now  quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband own eye so oilily for dominion  for power  she cramped  squeezed  pared  pruned  drew back  peeped through  so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable  and caused this pressure on the top of the head  which might well be imputed to the professional conversation  or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life  lady bradshaw said   is not his own but his patients    disagreeable it was  so that guests  when the clock struck ten  breathed in the air of harley street even with rapture  which relief  however  was denied to his patients ,2563,427,6.75,2.2153729731288085,2.8695652173913038,2.2153729731288085,0.3424326611396566,6.250000000000001,2.012595797384606,2.5531914893617023,2.012595797384606,0.2935757250122277,28.276366568281087,0.5036625123710674,0.5463244394674096,0.5036625123710674,0.0950885813305784,-0.6475746031746025,-0.6651470769057533,-0.6065292416225746,-0.6651470769057533,-0.2878047734370098,4.333,0.5881366633365135,0.9553737982493904,0.5881366633365135,-0.20186481202520465,43.55117653751828,1.4763594108351688,1.8728347872314777,1.4763594108351688,0.1779892094196605,2.591913910812515,1.5715531419853992,1.9465408811702216,1.5715531419853992,0.3707484510062095,"{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.706, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9773}",0.9773,1.2766765169973673,0.8051298671234778,1.2766765169973673,0.037510013870685636,0.22470449172576829,0.5586345464883405,0.8313578248330429,0.5586345464883405,0.04976671833533652,1.74848483378464,4.5221431126307685,4.555283348764223,4.5221431126307685,0.6662935260885179,71.27763254734417,3.67632282526857,3.0136106665873106,3.67632282526857,-0.6334284051799028,0.5836,0.9394235857093736,0.7606998226621847,0.9394235857093736,0.2299847316788309
384,384,6,"There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm-chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove (if the patient was obstinate) that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not. There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted; others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself. Why live? they demanded. Sir William replied that life was good. Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year. But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty. He acquiesced. They lacked a sense of proportion. And perhaps, after all, there is no God? He shrugged his shoulders. In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own? But there they were mistaken. Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art--a sense of proportion. There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career. All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion. If they failed him, he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control.

395,395,6,"Lady Bruton raised the carnations, holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in the picture behind her; she remained fixed, tranced. Which was she now, the General's great-grand-daughter? great-great-grand-daughter? Richard Dalloway asked himself. Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir Talbot--that was it. It was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women. She should have been a general of dragoons herself. And Richard would have served under her, cheerfully; he had the greatest respect for her; he cherished these romantic views about well-set-up old women of pedigree, and would have liked, in his good-humoured way, to bring some young hot-heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her; as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea-drinking enthusiasts! He knew her country. He knew her people. There was a vine, still bearing, which either Lovelace or Herrick--she never read a word poetry of herself, but so the story ran--had sat under.

397,397,6,"Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her. Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people; of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs. Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing-room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there (one evening in the eighties) in Lady Bruton's presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion. (She kept the pen and told the story.)

Borne like a frail shallop on deep, deep floods, Lady Bruton's great-grandfather and his memoir and his campaigns in North America were whelmed and sunk. And Millicent Bruton too. She went under. Richard didn't care a straw what became of Emigration; about that letter, whether the editor put it in or not. The necklace hung stretched between Hugh's admirable fingers.

427,427,6,"""I should like to see Mr. Dubonnet,"" said Hugh in his curt worldly way. It appeared that this Dubonnet had the measurements of Mrs. Whitbread's neck, or, more strangely still, knew her views upon Spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line (which Hugh could not remember). All of which seemed to Richard Dalloway awfully odd. For he never gave Clarissa presents, except a bracelet two or three years ago, which had not been a success. She never wore it. It pained him to remember that she never wore it. And as a single spider's thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf, so Richard's mind, recovering from its lethargy, set now on his wife, Clarissa, whom Peter Walsh had loved so passionately; and Richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon; of himself and Clarissa; of their life together; and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him, and taking up first this brooch then that ring, ""How much is that?"" he asked, but doubted his own taste. He wanted to open the drawing-room door and come in holding out something; a present for Clarissa. Only what? But Hugh was on his legs again. He was unspeakably pompous. Really, after dealing here for thirty-five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business. For Dubonnet, it seemed, was out, and Hugh would not buy anything until Mr. Dubonnet chose to be in; at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow. It was all perfectly correct. And yet Richard couldn't have said that to save his life! Why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive. Hugh was becoming an intolerable ass. Richard Dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society. And, flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell, Richard turned at the corner of Conduit Street eager, yes, very eager, to travel that spider's thread of attachment between himself and Clarissa; he would go straight to her, in Westminster.", i should like to see mr  dubonnet   said hugh in his curt worldly way  it appeared that this dubonnet had the measurements of mrs  whitbread own neck  or  more strangely still  knew her views upon spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line  which hugh could not remember   all of which seemed to richard dalloway awfully odd  for he never gave clarissa presents  except a bracelet two or three years ago  which had not been a success  she never wore it  it pained him to remember that she never wore it  and as a single spider own thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf  so richard own mind  recovering from its lethargy  set now on his wife  clarissa  whom peter walsh had loved so passionately  and richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon  of himself and clarissa  of their life together  and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him  and taking up first this brooch then that ring   how much is that   he asked  but doubted his own taste  he wanted to open the drawing room door and come in holding out something  a present for clarissa  only what  but hugh was on his legs again  he was unspeakably pompous  really  after dealing here for thirty five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business  for dubonnet  it seemed  was out  and hugh would not buy anything until mr  dubonnet chose to be in  at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow  it was all perfectly correct  and yet richard could not have said that to save his life  why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive  hugh was becoming an intolerable ass  richard dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society  and  flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell  richard turned at the corner of conduit street eager  yes  very eager  to travel that spider own thread of attachment between himself and clarissa  he would go straight to her  in westminster ,1972,352,-0.4000000000000001,-0.35793890511706394,-0.2391304347826088,-0.35793890511706394,-0.09567909142918757,-0.4000000000000001,-0.4211395508661792,-0.27659574468085113,-0.4211395508661792,-0.14673938392054728,0.0,-0.01980544573596421,0.0,-0.01980544573596421,0.0,2.744940476190476,1.3088034791006722,1.8059259259259253,1.3088034791006722,0.09902023121188804,9.648999999999996,1.9197879149918275,2.480987229157698,1.9197879149918275,0.1043302834540458,6.295911998391267,-0.12284794530667376,-0.026035846341264192,-0.12284794530667376,-0.13085630302527748,0.5013936748205152,0.1236240258518998,0.3765492679084968,0.1236240258518998,0.08700071767402848,"{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.9472}",0.9472,1.2283396183371662,0.7772582063984442,1.2283396183371662,0.07098213260539342,0.23480017006802725,0.6035149097675206,0.8813410447849076,0.6035149097675206,0.11099735743778333,0.9458849176134544,2.182082201059272,2.3431908986860983,2.182082201059272,0.3353278242854968,58.32879750411993,2.7844802271946203,2.340929596272592,2.7844802271946203,-0.6429335644555406,-0.9999,-0.8512446471004158,-0.07755220878219209,-0.8512446471004158,0.09842788655668833
428,428,6,"But he wanted to come in holding something. Flowers? Yes, flowers, since he did not trust his taste in gold; any number of flowers, roses, orchids, to celebrate what was, reckoning things as you will, an event; this feeling about her when they spoke of Peter Walsh at luncheon; and they never spoke of it; not for years had they spoken of it; which, he thought, grasping his red and white roses together (a vast bunch in tissue paper), is the greatest mistake in the world. The time comes when it can't be said; one's too shy to say it, he thought, pocketing his sixpence or two of change, setting off with his great bunch held against his body to Westminster to say straight out in so many words (whatever she might think of him), holding out his flowers, ""I love you."" Why not? Really it was a miracle thinking of the war, and thousands of poor chaps, with all their lives before them, shovelled together, already half forgotten; it was a miracle. Here he was walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words that he loved her. Which one never does say, he thought. Partly one's lazy; partly one's shy. And Clarissa--it was difficult to think of her; except in starts, as at luncheon, when he saw her quite distinctly; their whole life. He stopped at the crossing; and repeated--being simple by nature, and undebauched, because he had tramped, and shot; being pertinacious and dogged, having championed the down-trodden and followed his instincts in the House of Commons; being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless, rather stiff--he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married Clarissa; a miracle--his life had been a miracle, he thought; hesitating to cross. But it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing Piccadilly alone. The police ought to have stopped the traffic at once. He had no illusions about the London police. Indeed, he was collecting evidence of their malpractices; and those costermongers, not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets; and prostitutes, good Lord, the fault wasn't in them, nor in young men either, but in our detestable social system and so forth; all of which he considered, could be seen considering, grey, dogged, dapper, clean, as he walked across the Park to tell his wife that he loved her.",but he wanted to come in holding something  flowers  yes  flowers  since he did not trust his taste in gold  any number of flowers  roses  orchids  to celebrate what was  reckoning things as you will  an event  this feeling about her when they spoke of peter walsh at luncheon  and they never spoke of it  not for years had they spoken of it  which  he thought  grasping his red and white roses together  a vast bunch in tissue paper   is the greatest mistake in the world  the time comes when it cannot be said  one own too shy to say it  he thought  pocketing his sixpence or two of change  setting off with his great bunch held against his body to westminster to say straight out in so many words  whatever she might think of him   holding out his flowers   i love you   why not  really it was a miracle thinking of the war  and thousands of poor chaps  with all their lives before them  shovelled together  already half forgotten  it was a miracle  here he was walking across london to say to clarissa in so many words that he loved her  which one never does say  he thought  partly one own lazy  partly one own shy  and clarissa  it was difficult to think of her  except in starts  as at luncheon  when he saw her quite distinctly  their whole life  he stopped at the crossing  and repeated  being simple by nature  and undebauched  because he had tramped  and shot  being pertinacious and dogged  having championed the down trodden and followed his instincts in the house of commons  being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless  rather stiff  he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married clarissa  a miracle  his life had been a miracle  he thought  hesitating to cross  but it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing piccadilly alone  the police ought to have stopped the traffic at once  he had no illusions about the london police  indeed  he was collecting evidence of their malpractices  and those costermongers  not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets  and prostitutes  good lord  the fault was not in them  nor in young men either  but in our detestable social system and so forth  all of which he considered  could be seen considering  grey  dogged  dapper  clean  as he walked across the park to tell his wife that he loved her ,2329,407,1.5,0.32587823735386723,0.5869565217391304,0.32587823735386723,0.02899489810495066,2.5,0.6401886461153662,0.9574468085106382,0.6401886461153662,0.056451003217049725,42.67009386633414,0.7701272655445971,0.8244239958218883,0.7701272655445971,0.15054343765742173,-2.770833333333333,-1.9005749682761648,-2.1164021164021163,-1.9005749682761648,-0.5075475252619835,13.056000000000004,2.7732370900086964,3.4587458745874615,2.7732370900086964,0.1870970775998736,6.238036514127795,-0.1253322895012295,-0.028985712858955688,-0.1253322895012295,-0.14025395142222236,5.7089866000572425,3.7304895761597963,4.287478747155136,3.7304895761597963,0.8567443757466477,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.745, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.9925}",0.9925,1.3010858478822531,0.8192045928052224,1.3010858478822531,0.04997964044048028,0.1607426303854875,0.2742919321888824,0.5146857127155534,0.2742919321888824,-0.007328016640461446,0.9810132142583704,2.28450228884224,2.4400100463419143,2.28450228884224,0.27024131803492984,67.69226968639302,3.429383288370096,2.8273540868470897,3.429383288370096,-0.6381545091512448,-0.8914,-0.7285496655659275,-0.020115931288213613,-0.7285496655659275,0.1187663762428234
429,429,6,"For he would say it in so many words, when he came into the room. Because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels, he thought, crossing the Green Park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families, poor families, were sprawling; children kicking up their legs; sucking milk; paper bags thrown about, which could easily be picked up (if people objected) by one of those fat gentlemen in livery; for he was of opinion that every park, and every square, during the summer months should be open to children (the grass of the park flushed and faded, lighting up the poor mothers of Westminster and their crawling babies, as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath). But what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature, stretched on her elbow (as if she had flung herself on the earth, rid of all ties, to observe curiously, to speculate boldly, to consider the whys and the wherefores, impudent, loose-lipped, humorous), he did not know. Bearing his flowers like a weapon, Richard Dalloway approached her; intent he passed her; still there was time for a spark between them--she laughed at the sight of him, he smiled good-humouredly, considering the problem of the female vagrant; not that they would ever speak. But he would tell Clarissa that he loved her, in so many words. He had, once upon a time, been jealous of Peter Walsh; jealous of him and Clarissa.

456,456,6,"How like him! He would go on saying ""An hour's complete rest after luncheon"" to the end of time, because a doctor had ordered it once. It was like him to take what doctors said literally; part of his adorable, divine simplicity, which no one had to the same extent; which made him go and do the thing while she and Peter frittered their time away bickering. He was already halfway to the House of Commons, to his Armenians, his Albanians, having settled her on the sofa, looking at his roses. And people would say, ""Clarissa Dalloway is spoilt."" She cared much more for her roses than for the Armenians. Hunted out of existence, maimed, frozen, the victims of cruelty and injustice (she had heard Richard say so over and over again)--no, she could feel nothing for the Albanians, or was it the Armenians? but she loved her roses (didn't that help the Armenians?)--the only flowers she could bear to see cut. But Richard was already at the House of Commons; at his Committee, having settled all her difficulties. But no; alas, that was not true. He did not see the reasons against asking Ellie Henderson. She would do it, of course, as he wished it. Since he had brought the pillows, she would lie down. . . . But--but--why did she suddenly feel, for no reason that she could discover, desperately unhappy? As a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully, this way and that, and searches here and there vainly, and at last spies it there at the roots, so she went through one thing and another; no, it was not Sally Seton saying that Richard would never be in the Cabinet because he had a second-class brain (it came back to her); no, she did not mind that; nor was it to do with Elizabeth either and Doris Kilman; those were facts. It was a feeling, some unpleasant feeling, earlier in the day perhaps; something that Peter had said, combined with some depression of her own, in her bedroom, taking off her hat; and what Richard had said had added to it, but what had he said? There were his roses. Her parties! That was it! Her parties! Both of them criticised her very unfairly, laughed at her very unjustly, for her parties. That was it!

459,459,6,"Since she was lying on the sofa, cloistered, exempt, the presence of this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically existent; with robes of sound from the street, sunny, with hot breath, whispering, blowing out the blinds. But suppose Peter said to her, ""Yes, yes, but your parties--what's the sense of your parties?"" all she could say was (and nobody could be expected to understand): They're an offering; which sounded horribly vague.

And then, just as she might have had a chance at Miss Dolby's school, the war came; and she had never been able to tell lies. Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans. She had had to go. It was true that the family was of German origin; spelt the name Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her brother had been killed. They turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all villains--when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her life had been spent in Germany! And after all, she could read history. She had had to take whatever she could get. Mr. Dalloway had come across her working for the Friends. He had allowed her (and that was really generous of him) to teach his daughter history. Also she did a little Extension lecturing and so on.

469,469,6,"But Miss Kilman did not hate Mrs. Dalloway. Turning her large gooseberry-coloured eyes upon Clarissa, observing her small pink face, her delicate body, her air of freshness and fashion, Miss Kilman felt, Fool! Simpleton! You who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure; who have trifled your life away! And there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her; to unmask her.

Gigantic as it was, it had something to do with her. Down, down, into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn. She was forced, so Clarissa imagined, by that sound, to move, to go--but where? Clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared, and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom. She was still there moving about at the other end of the room. Why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes? when, thought Clarissa, that's the miracle, that's the mystery; that old lady, she meant, whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing-table. She could still see her. And the supreme mystery which Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had solved, but Clarissa didn't believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there another.

484,484,6,"It was the flesh that she must control. Clarissa Dalloway had insulted her. That she expected. But she had not triumphed; she had not mastered the flesh. Ugly, clumsy, Clarissa Dalloway had laughed at her for being that; and had revived the fleshly desires, for she minded looking as she did beside Clarissa. Nor could she talk as she did. But why wish to resemble her? Why? She despised Mrs. Dalloway from the bottom of her heart. She was not serious. She was not good. Her life was a tissue of vanity and deceit. Yet Doris Kilman had been overcome. She had, as a matter of fact, very nearly burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her. ""It is the flesh, it is the flesh,"" she muttered (it being her habit to talk aloud) trying to subdue this turbulent and painful feeling as she walked down Victoria Street. She prayed to God.

She inclined to be passive. It was expression she needed, but her eyes were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight, she was always charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when she was interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene. What could she be thinking? Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored. For it was beginning. Her mother could see that--the compliments were beginning. That she did not care more about it--for instance for her clothes--sometimes worried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave her a charm.

And did Elizabeth give one thought to poor Miss Kilman who loved her without jealousy, to whom she had been a fawn in the open, a moon in a glade? She was delighted to be free. The fresh air was so delicious. It had been so stuffy in the Army and Navy Stores. And now it was like riding, to be rushing up Whitehall; and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn-coloured coat responded freely like a rider, like the figure-head of a ship, for the breeze slightly disarrayed her; the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood; and her fine eyes, having no eyes to meet, gazed ahead, blank, bright, with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture.",suddenly elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus  in front of everybody  she took a seat on top  the impetuous creature  a pirate  started forward  sprang away  she had to hold the rail to steady herself  for a pirate it was  reckless  unscrupulous  bearing down ruthlessly  circumventing dangerously  boldly snatching a passenger  or ignoring a passenger  squeezing eel like and arrogant in between  and then rushing insolently all sails spread up whitehall  and did elizabeth give one thought to poor miss kilman who loved her without jealousy  to whom she had been a fawn in the open  a moon in a glade  she was delighted to be free  the fresh air was so delicious  it had been so stuffy in the army and navy stores  and now it was like riding  to be rushing up whitehall  and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn coloured coat responded freely like a rider  like the figure head of a ship  for the breeze slightly disarrayed her  the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood  and her fine eyes  having no eyes to meet  gazed ahead  blank  bright  with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture ,1168,197,2.05,0.523825304911242,0.826086956521739,0.523825304911242,0.202762117893422,3.05,0.8414750283015212,1.1914893617021276,0.8414750283015212,0.31717043847244525,79.26106246346889,1.4475198000644598,1.5313939086685957,1.4475198000644598,0.5777318403586279,1.4770833333333315,0.5710949491365355,0.9043386243386232,0.5710949491365355,0.08655166496099198,1.0480000000000007,-0.23475166655207,0.012627349691491091,-0.23475166655207,-0.2874879630626541,0.0,-0.3931042139442158,-0.3469333772861241,-0.3931042139442158,-0.1965348783097024,2.9584334384350766,1.8254106682314328,2.22179896026316,1.8254106682314328,0.9172383915514912,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.717, 'pos': 0.204, 'compound': 0.9807}",0.9807,1.2821364989058286,0.8082781610259733,1.2821364989058286,0.2613576059603184,0.2888888888888889,0.8439664443439001,1.1491317011513205,0.8439664443439001,0.4586210770304425,1.1365438500581853,2.737967526071822,2.8686771048309154,2.737967526071822,1.05999111033956,38.45963469965599,1.4160045521291738,1.3087433295583486,1.4160045521291738,-0.4128906052766839,0.9866,1.3951478028374729,0.9740345676398192,1.3951478028374729,0.34384401037568124

516,516,6,"She liked people who were ill. And every profession is open to the women of your generation, said Miss Kilman. So she might be a doctor. She might be a farmer. Animals are often ill. She might own a thousand acres and have people under her. She would go and see them in their cottages. This was Somerset House. One might be a very good farmer--and that, strangely enough though Miss Kilman had her share in it, was almost entirely due to Somerset House.

It was not marriage; it was not being one's husband to look strange like that, always to be starting, laughing, sitting hour after hour silent, or clutching her and telling her to write. The table drawer was full of those writings; about war; about Shakespeare; about great discoveries; how there is no death. Lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason (and both Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him), and waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth!

He had come in, rather shyly, looking round him, and his hat had fallen when he hung it up. That she could remember. She knew he was English, though not one of the large Englishmen her sister admired, for he was always thin; but he had a beautiful fresh colour; and with his big nose, his bright eyes, his way of sitting a little hunched made her think, she had often told him, of a young hawk, that first evening she saw him, when they were playing dominoes, and he had come in--of a young hawk; but with her he was always very gentle. She had never seen him wild or drunk, only suffering sometimes through this terrible war, but even so, when she came in, he would put it all away. Anything, anything in the whole world, any little bother with her work, anything that struck her to say she would tell him, and he understood at once. Her own family even were not the same. Being older than she was and being so clever--how serious he was, wanting her to read Shakespeare before she could even read a child's story in English!--being so much more experienced, he could help her.

581,581,6,"Holmes was coming upstairs. Holmes would burst open the door. Holmes would say ""In a funk, eh?"" Holmes would get him. But no; not Holmes; not Bradshaw. Getting up rather unsteadily, hopping indeed from foot to foot, he considered Mrs. Filmer's nice clean bread knife with ""Bread"" carved on the handle. Ah, but one mustn't spoil that. The gas fire? But it was too late now. Holmes was coming. Razors he might have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had packed them. There remained only the window, the large Bloomsbury-lodging house window, the tiresome, the troublesome, and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out.

587,587,6,"One of the triumphs of civilisation, Peter Walsh thought. It is one of the triumphs of civilisation, as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded. Swiftly, cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital, having picked up instantly, humanely, some poor devil; some one hit on the head, struck down by disease, knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings, as might happen to oneself. That was civilisation. It struck him coming back from the East--the efficiency, the organisation, the communal spirit of London. Every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass. Perhaps it was morbid; or was it not touching rather, the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside--busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife; or presumably how easily it might have been them there, stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse. . . . Ah, but thinking became morbid, sentimental, directly one began conjuring up doctors, dead bodies; a little glow of pleasure, a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more--fatal to art, fatal to friendship. True. And yet, thought Peter Walsh, as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the Tottenham Court Road, chiming constantly, it is the privilege of loneliness; in privacy one may do as one chooses. One might weep if no one saw. It had been his undoing--this susceptibility--in Anglo-Indian society; not weeping at the right time, or laughing either. I have that in me, he thought standing by the pillar-box, which could now dissolve in tears. Why, Heaven knows. Beauty of some sort probably, and the weight of the day, which beginning with that visit to Clarissa had exhausted him with its heat, its intensity, and the drip, drip, of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood, deep, dark, and no one would ever know. Partly for that reason, its secrecy, complete and inviolable, he had found life like an unknown garden, full of turns and corners, surprising, yes; really it took one's breath away, these moments; there coming to him by the pillar-box opposite the British Museum one of them, a moment, in which things came together; this ambulance; and life and death. It was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him, like a white shell-sprinkled beach, left bare.

588,588,6,"Clarissa once, going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere, Clarissa superficially at least, so easily moved, now in despair, now in the best of spirits, all aquiver in those days and such good company, spotting queer little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus, for they used to explore London and bring back bags full of treasures from the Caledonian market--Clarissa had a theory in those days--they had heaps of theories, always theories, as young people have. It was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction; not knowing people; not being known. For how could they know each other? You met every day; then not for six months, or years. It was unsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people. But she said, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt herself everywhere; not ""here, here, here""; and she tapped the back of the seat; but everywhere. She waved her hand, going up Shaftesbury Avenue. She was all that. So that to know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them; even the places. Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter--even trees, or barns. It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death . . . perhaps--perhaps.",clarissa once  going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere  clarissa superficially at least  so easily moved  now in despair  now in the best of spirits  all aquiver in those days and such good company  spotting queer little scenes  names  people from the top of a bus  for they used to explore london and bring back bags full of treasures from the caledonian market  clarissa had a theory in those days  they had heaps of theories  always theories  as young people have  it was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction  not knowing people  not being known  for how could they know each other  you met every day  then not for six months  or years  it was unsatisfactory  they agreed  how little one knew people  but she said  sitting on the bus going up shaftesbury avenue  she felt herself everywhere  not  here  here  here   and she tapped the back of the seat  but everywhere  she waved her hand  going up shaftesbury avenue  she was all that  so that to know her  or any one  one must seek out the people who completed them  even the places  odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to  some woman in the street  some man behind a counter  even trees  or barns  it ended in a transcendental theory which  with her horror of death  allowed her to believe  or say that she believed  for all her scepticism   that since our apparitions  the part of us which appears  are so momentary compared with the other  the unseen part of us  which spreads wide  the unseen might survive  be recovered somehow attached to this person or that  or even haunting certain places after death       perhaps  perhaps ,1627,284,1.5999999999999996,0.3618686132733898,0.6304347826086955,0.3618686132733898,0.07937003481094851,0.4000000000000001,-0.1283593585954079,0.0638297872340426,-0.1283593585954079,-0.07570063384445029,-75.15983663423384,-1.4112064986107766,-1.4521545942087424,-1.4112064986107766,-0.3800144643546408,3.302083333333333,1.6329796218454753,2.2021164021164017,1.6329796218454753,0.2580297349245351,4.152000000000003,0.5427963931052101,0.9034294733821218,0.5427963931052101,-0.12254786556974945,31.94380103008116,0.9781049888997432,1.281216266826782,0.9781049888997432,0.2164897888563168,1.2168645225810035,0.6191710453838808,0.9138716105378182,0.6191710453838808,0.2617041063739381,"{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.8791}",-0.8791,-1.704473605022488,-0.9138386036390572,-1.704473605022488,-0.4106307743952014,0.11610275689223055,0.07584526310991081,0.2936758370247604,0.07584526310991081,-0.0012976230463964387,0.3895729087905687,0.5600984950373137,0.8099069177014488,0.5600984950373137,0.02604069602506061,49.36993205900072,2.1674441920841923,1.8755240847874632,2.1674441920841923,-0.5795701040900082,0.9956,1.4053252667435594,0.9787988671554486,1.4053252667435594,0.2968639261420299
589,589,6,"Looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent. Brief, broken, often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions (this morning, for instance, in came Elizabeth, like a long-legged colt, handsome, dumb, just as he was beginning to talk to Clarissa) the effect of them on his life was immeasurable. There was a mystery about it. You were given a sharp, acute, uncomfortable grain--the actual meeting; horribly painful as often as not; yet in absence, in the most unlikely places, it would flower out, open, shed its scent, let you touch, taste, look about you, get the whole feel of it and understanding, after years of lying lost. Thus she had come to him; on board ship; in the Himalayas; suggested by the oddest things (so Sally Seton, generous, enthusiastic goose! thought of him when she saw blue hydrangeas). She had influenced him more than any person he had ever known.

The young lady handed him some letters. He went upstairs--he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late summer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people did in those days. First on top of some hill there she would stand, hands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to them--she saw the Severn beneath. Or in a wood, making the kettle boil--very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying, blowing in their faces; her little pink face showing through; begging water from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch them go. They walked always; the others drove. She was bored driving, disliked all animals, except that dog. They tramped miles along roads. She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across country; and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed people, discussed politics (she was a Radical then); never noticing a thing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and made him look with her; and so on again, through stubble fields, she walking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for all her delicacy; to drop down on Bourton in the dusk. Then, after dinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice, and they would lie sunk in arm-chairs, trying not to laugh, but always breaking down and laughing, laughing--laughing at nothing. Breitkopf was supposed not to see.

597,597,6,"It was odd; it was true; lots of people felt it. Peter Walsh, who had done just respectably, filled the usual posts adequately, was liked, but thought a little cranky, gave himself airs--it was odd that he should have had, especially now that his hair was grey, a contented look; a look of having reserves. It was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly. There was something unusual about him, or something behind him. It might be that he was bookish--never came to see you without taking up the book on the table (he was now reading, with his bootlaces trailing on the floor); or that he was a gentleman, which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and in his manners of course to women. For it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger. But at her own risk. That is to say, though he might be ever so easy, and indeed with his gaiety and good-breeding fascinating to be with, it was only up to a point. She said something--no, no; he saw through that. He wouldn't stand that--no, no. Then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men. He was the best judge of cooking in India. He was a man. But not the sort of man one had to respect--which was a mercy; not like Major Simmons, for instance; not in the least like that, Daisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them.",it was odd  it was true  lots of people felt it  peter walsh  who had done just respectably  filled the usual posts adequately  was liked  but thought a little cranky  gave himself airs  it was odd that he should have had  especially now that his hair was grey  a contented look  a look of having reserves  it was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly  there was something unusual about him  or something behind him  it might be that he was bookish  never came to see you without taking up the book on the table  he was now reading  with his bootlaces trailing on the floor   or that he was a gentleman  which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe  and in his manners of course to women  for it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger  but at her own risk  that is to say  though he might be ever so easy  and indeed with his gaiety and good breeding fascinating to be with  it was only up to a point  she said something  no  no  he saw through that  he would not stand that  no  no  then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men  he was the best judge of cooking in india  he was a man  but not the sort of man one had to respect  which was a mercy  not like major simmons  for instance  not in the least like that  daisy thought  when  in spite of her two small children  she used to compare them ,1489,281,7.1000000000000005,2.3413392888471383,3.0217391304347823,2.3413392888471383,0.5870026338406715,8.6,2.8726376121799966,3.553191489361702,2.8726376121799966,0.7393235002903175,60.0333742324461,1.0915660507343543,1.1598979468482715,1.0915660507343543,0.3067743707650373,7.725,4.206474096915198,5.347301587301587,4.206474096915198,0.916839415005734,12.394000000000005,2.6074069303781804,3.268761658774575,2.6074069303781804,0.4004238460693797,44.69142349479543,1.5253052804848355,1.9309522503331096,1.5253052804848355,0.3874822787087465,2.949872736173783,1.8194813833360888,2.215369828163664,1.8194813833360888,0.6411853749024604,"{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9806}",0.9806,1.2819759112026383,0.8081855641464881,1.2819759112026383,0.1374660929619345,0.21549382716049384,0.5176885141646037,0.7857562657043325,0.5176885141646037,0.1544118892344571,1.1120002255298915,2.6664081161718864,2.801030989471727,2.6664081161718864,0.6339605913815417,49.4537488123252,2.1732170164963884,1.8798782945019588,2.1732170164963884,-0.5627827568792101,0.969,1.3752452067544592,0.9647177152536992,1.3752452067544592,0.2950742840890484

599,599,6,"Well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age. And it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly. Suppose they did marry? For him it would be all very well, but what about her? Mrs. Burgess, a good sort and no chatterbox, in whom he had confided, thought this absence of his in England, ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make Daisy reconsider, think what it meant. It was a question of her position, Mrs. Burgess said; the social barrier; giving up her children. She'd be a widow with a past one of these days, draggling about in the suburbs, or more likely, indiscriminate (you know, she said, what such women get like, with too much paint). But Peter Walsh pooh-poohed all that. He didn't mean to die yet. Anyhow she must settle for herself; judge for herself, he thought, padding about the room in his socks, smoothing out his dress-shirt, for he might go to Clarissa's party, or he might go to one of the Halls, or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at Oxford. And if he did retire, that's what he'd do--write books. He would go to Oxford and poke about in the Bodleian.

608,608,6,"For the great revolution of Mr. Willett's summer time had taken place since Peter Walsh's last visit to England. The prolonged evening was new to him. It was inspiriting, rather. For as the young people went by with their despatch-boxes, awfully glad to be free, proud too, dumbly, of stepping this famous pavement, joy of a kind, cheap, tinselly, if you like, but all the same rapture, flushed their faces. They dressed well too; pink stockings; pretty shoes. They would now have two hours at the pictures. It sharpened, it refined them, the yellow-blue evening light; and on the leaves in the square shone lurid, livid--they looked as if dipped in sea water--the foliage of a submerged city. He was astonished by the beauty; it was encouraging too, for where the returned Anglo-Indian sat by rights (he knew crowds of them) in the Oriental Club biliously summing up the ruin of the world, here was he, as young as ever; envying young people their summer time and the rest of it, and more than suspecting from the words of a girl, from a housemaid's laughter--intangible things you couldn't lay your hands on--that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable. On top of them it had pressed; weighed them down, the women especially, like those flowers Clarissa's Aunt Helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting-paper with Littr 's dictionary on top, sitting under the lamp after dinner. She was dead now. He had heard of her, from Clarissa, losing the sight of one eye. It seemed so fitting--one of nature's masterpieces--that old Miss Parry should turn to glass. She would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch. She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so complete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone-white, eminent, like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long, long voyage, this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire--he had held out that copper millions of times. Surrey was all out once more)--this interminable life. But cricket was no mere game. Cricket was important. He could never help reading about cricket.

Might it consume her anyhow! Burn her to cinders! Better anything, better brandish one's torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some Ellie Henderson! It was extraordinary how Peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner. He made her see herself; exaggerate. It was idiotic. But why did he come, then, merely to criticise? Why always take, never give? Why not risk one's one little point of view? There he was wandering off, and she must speak to him. But she would not get the chance. Life was that--humiliation, renunciation. What Lord Lexham was saying was that his wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because ""my dear, you ladies are all alike""--Lady Lexham being seventy-five at least! It was delicious, how they petted each other, that old couple. She did like old Lord Lexham. She did think it mattered, her party, and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong, all falling flat.

646,646,7,"He looked always as if he were on duty, thought Peter, a privileged, but secretive being, hoarding secrets which he would die to defend, though it was only some little piece of tittle-tattle dropped by a court footman, which would be in all the papers tomorrow. Such were his rattles, his baubles, in playing with which he had grown white, come to the verge of old age, enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the English public school man. Inevitably one made up things like that about Hugh; that was his style; the style of those admirable letters which Peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the Times, and had thanked God he was out of that pernicious hubble-bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives. An olive-skinned youth from one of the Universities stood obsequiously by. Him he would patronise, initiate, teach how to get on. For he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses, making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age, their affliction, thinking themselves quite forgotten, yet here was dear Hugh driving up and spending an hour talking of the past, remembering trifles, praising the home-made cake, though Hugh might eat cake with a Duchess any day of his life, and, to look at him, probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation. The All-judging, the All-merciful, might excuse. Peter Walsh had no mercy. Villains there must be, and God knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than Hugh Whitbread and his kindness. Look at him now, on tiptoe, dancing forward, bowing and scraping, as the Prime Minister and Lady Bruton emerged, intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something, something private, to Lady Bruton as she passed. She stopped. She wagged her fine old head. She was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility. She had her toadies, minor officials in Government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf, in return for which she gave them luncheon.

Lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed, having that gift still; to be; to exist; to sum it all up in the moment as she passed; turned, caught her scarf in some other woman's dress, unhitched it, laughed, all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element. But age had brushed her; even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves. There was a breath of tenderness; her severity, her prudery, her woodenness were all warmed through now, and she had about her as she said good-bye to the thick gold-laced man who was doing his best, and good luck to him, to look important, an inexpressible dignity; an exquisite cordiality; as if she wished the whole world well, and must now, being on the very verge and rim of things, take her leave.

684,684,7,"Lady Bruton stood by Miss Parry's chair, a spectral grenadier, draped in black, inviting Peter Walsh to lunch; cordial; but without small talk, remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of India. She had been there, of course; had stayed with three Viceroys; thought some of the Indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows; but what a tragedy it was--the state of India! The Prime Minister had just been telling her (old Miss Parry huddled up in her shawl, did not care what the Prime Minister had just been telling her), and Lady Bruton would like to have Peter Walsh's opinion, he being fresh from the centre, and she would get Sir Sampson to meet him, for really it prevented her from sleeping at night, the folly of it, the wickedness she might say, being a soldier's daughter. She was an old woman now, not good for much. But her house, her servants, her good friend Milly Brush--did he remember her?--were all there only asking to be used if--if they could be of help, in short. For she never spoke of England, but this isle of men, this dear, dear land, was in her blood (without reading Shakespeare), and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow, could have led troops to attack, ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church, or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside, that woman was Millicent Bruton. Debarred by her sex and some truancy, too, of the logical faculty (she found it impossible to write a letter to the Times), she had the thought of Empire always at hand, and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing, her robustness of demeanour, so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which, in some spiritual shape, the Union Jack had ceased to fly.

There! the old lady had put out her light! the whole house was dark now with this going on, she repeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the sun. She must go back to them. But what an extraordinary night! She felt somehow very like him--the young man who had killed himself. She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must go back. She must assemble. She must find Sally and Peter.

711,711,7,"That was his old trick, opening a pocket-knife, thought Sally, always opening and shutting a knife when he got excited.

She had called Richard ""Wickham."" Why not call Richard ""Wickham""? Clarissa had flared up! and indeed they had never seen each other since, she and Clarissa, not more than half a dozen times perhaps in the last ten years.

727,727,7,"But it had been a silly thing to do, in many ways, Peter said, to marry like that; ""a perfect goose she was,"" he said, but, he said, ""we had a splendid time of it,"" but how could that be? Sally wondered; what did he mean? and how odd it was to know him and yet not know a single thing that had happened to him. And did he say it out of pride? Very likely, for after all it must be galling for him (though he was an oddity, a sort of sprite, not at all an ordinary man), it must be lonely at his age to have no home, nowhere to go to. But he must stay with them for weeks and weeks. Of course he would; he would love to stay with them, and that was how it came out. All these years the Dalloways had never been once.
