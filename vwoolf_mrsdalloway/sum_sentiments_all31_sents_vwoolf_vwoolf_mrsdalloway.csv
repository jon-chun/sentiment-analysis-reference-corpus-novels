0,0,Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,For Lucy had her work cut out for her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2,The doors would be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,3,"And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on a beach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4,What a lark!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,5,What a plunge!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,6,"For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,"How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, ""Musing among the vegetables?""--was that it?--""I prefer men to cauliflowers""--was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace--Peter Walsh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,8,"He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished--how strange it was!--a few sayings like this about cabbages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,9,"She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10,"A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,11,"There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,12,"For having lived in Westminster--how many years now? over twenty,--one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,There!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,14,Out it boomed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,15,"First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,16,The leaden circles dissolved in the air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,17,"Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,18,"For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can't be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,19,"In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,20,For it was the middle of June.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,21,"The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven--over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,22,It was June.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,23,The King and Queen were at the Palace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,24,"And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,25,"But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,26,"""Good-morning to you, Clarissa!"" said Hugh, rather extravagantly, for they had known each other as children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,27,"""Where are you off to?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,28,"""I love walking in London,"" said Mrs. Dalloway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,29,"""Really it's better than walking in the country.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,30,They had just come up--unfortunately--to see doctors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,31,"Other people came to see pictures; go to the opera; take their daughters out; the Whitbreads came ""to see doctors.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,32,Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,33,Was Evelyn ill again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,34,"Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome, perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always, but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,35,"Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,36,"Not the right hat for the early morning, was that it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,37,"For Hugh always made her feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he was coming to her party to-night, Evelyn absolutely insisted, only a little late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had to take one of Jim's boys,--she always felt a little skimpy beside Hugh; schoolgirlish; but attached to him, partly from having known him always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though Richard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,38,"She could remember scene after scene at Bourton--Peter furious; Hugh not, of course, his match in any way, but still not a positive imbecile as Peter made out; not a mere barber's block.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,"When his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did it, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at his worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be impossible; but adorable to walk with on a morning like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,40,"(June had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The mothers of Pimlico gave suck to their young. Messages were passing from the Fleet to the Admiralty. Arlington Street and Piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air in the Park and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, on waves of that divine vitality which Clarissa loved. To dance, to ride, she had adored all that.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,41,"For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter; she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks; but suddenly it would come over her, If he were with me now what would he say?--some days, some sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the old bitterness; which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people; they came back in the middle of St. James's Park on a fine morning--indeed they did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,42,"But Peter--however beautiful the day might be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink--Peter never saw a thing of all that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,43,"He would put on his spectacles, if she told him to; he would look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,44,"It was the state of the world that interested him; Wagner, Pope's poetry, people's characters eternally, and the defects of her own soul.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,45,How he scolded her!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,46,How they argued!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,47,"She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,48,"So she would still find herself arguing in St. James's Park, still making out that she had been right--and she had too--not to marry him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,49,"For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house; which Richard gave her, and she him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,50,"(Where was he this morning for instance? Some committee, she never asked what.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,51,But with Peter everything had to be shared; everything gone into.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,52,"And it was intolerable, and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain, she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed, both of them ruined, she was convinced; though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief, the anguish; and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to India!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,53,Never should she forget all that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,54,"Cold, heartless, a prude, he called her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,55,Never could she understand how he cared.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,56,"But those Indian women did presumably--silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoops. And she wasted her pity. For he was quite happy, he assured her--perfectly happy, though he had never done a thing that they talked of; his whole life had been a failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,57,It made her angry still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,58,She had reached the Park gates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,59,"She stood for a moment, looking at the omnibuses in Piccadilly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,60,She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,61,She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,62,"She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,63,"She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,64,"Not that she thought herself clever, or much out of the ordinary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,65,How she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge Fr ulein Daniels gave them she could not think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,66,"She knew nothing; no language, no history; she scarcely read a book now, except memoirs in bed; and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing; all this; the cabs passing; and she would not say of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,67,"Her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct, she thought, walking on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,68,"If you put her in a room with some one, up went her back like a cat's; or she purred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,69,"Devonshire House, Bath House, the house with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton--such hosts of people; and dancing all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and driving home across the Park.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,70,She remembered once throwing a shilling into the Serpentine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,71,"But every one remembered; what she loved was this, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,"Did it matter then, she asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must go on without her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,73,"but that somehow in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there, she survived, Peter survived, lived in each other, she being part, she was positive, of the trees at home; of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was; part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,74,But what was she dreaming as she looked into Hatchards' shop window?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,75,What was she trying to recover?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,76,"What image of white dawn in the country, as she read in the book spread open:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,77,Fear no more the heat o' the sun Nor the furious winter's rages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,"This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance; a perfectly upright and stoical bearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,80,"Think, for example, of the woman she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening the bazaar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,81,"There were Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities; there were Soapy Sponge and Mrs. Asquith's Memoirs and Big Game Shooting in Nigeria, all spread open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,82,Ever so many books there were; but none that seemed exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,"Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried-up little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment cordial; before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women's ailments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,"How much she wanted it--that people should look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,85,"Much rather would she have been one of those people like Richard who did things for themselves, whereas, she thought, waiting to cross, half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew (and now the policeman held up his hand) for no one was ever for a second taken in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,86,"Oh if she could have had her life over again! she thought, stepping on to the pavement, could have looked even differently!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,87,"She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady Bexborough, with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,88,"She would have been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather large; interested in politics like a man; with a country house; very dignified, very sincere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,89,"Instead of which she had a narrow pea-stick figure; a ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,90,"That she held herself well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and dressed well, considering that she spent little.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,91,"But often now this body she wore (she stopped to look at a Dutch picture), this body, with all its capacities, seemed nothing--nothing at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,92,"She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible; unseen; unknown; there being no more marrying, no more having of children now, but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs. Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,93,Bond Street fascinated her; Bond Street early in the morning in the season; its flags flying; its shops; no splash; no glitter; one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty years; a few pearls; salmon on an iceblock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,94,"""That is all,"" she said, looking at the fishmonger's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,95,"""That is all,"" she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where, before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,96,And her old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,97,He had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the War.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,98,"He had said, ""I have had enough.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,99,"Gloves and shoes; she had a passion for gloves; but her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a straw for either of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,100,"Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,101,Elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,102,The whole house this morning smelt of tar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,103,"Still, better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman; better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,"Better anything, she was inclined to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,105,"But it might be only a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,106,It might be falling in love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,107,But why with Miss Kilman?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,108,"who had been badly treated of course; one must make allowances for that, and Richard said she was very able, had a really historical mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,109,"Anyhow they were inseparable, and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to Communion; and how she dressed, how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit, it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous (so did causes); dulled their feelings, for Miss Kilman would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians, but in private inflicted positive torture, so insensitive was she, dressed in a green mackintosh coat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,110,"Year in year out she wore that coat; she perspired; she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were; how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal from school during the War--poor embittered unfortunate creature!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,111,"For it was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would have loved Miss Kilman!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,But not in this world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,113,"It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal monster! to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content quite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be stirring, this hatred, which, especially since her illness, had power to make her feel scraped, hurt in her spine; gave her physical pain, and made all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in being loved and making her home delightful rock, quiver, and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots, as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love! this hatred!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,114,"Nonsense, nonsense! she cried to herself, pushing through the swing doors of Mulberry's the florists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,115,"She advanced, light, tall, very upright, to be greeted at once by button-faced Miss Pym, whose hands were always bright red, as if they had been stood in cold water with the flowers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,"There were flowers: delphiniums, sweet peas, bunches of lilac; and carnations, masses of carnations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,117,There were roses; there were irises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,118,"Ah yes--so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to Miss Pym who owed her help, and thought her kind, for kind she had been years ago; very kind, but she looked older, this year, turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed, snuffing in, after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the exquisite coolness. And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked; and dark and prim the red carnations, holding their heads up; and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale--as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer's day, with its almost blue-black sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its arum lilies was over; and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower--roses, carnations, irises, lilac--glows; white, violet, red, deep orange; every flower seems to burn by itself, softly, purely in the misty beds; and how she loved the grey-white moths spinning in and out, over the cherry pie, over the evening primroses!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,119,"And as she began to go with Miss Pym from jar to jar, choosing, nonsense, nonsense, she said to herself, more and more gently, as if this beauty, this scent, this colour, and Miss Pym liking her, trusting her, were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred, that monster, surmount it all; and it lifted her up and up when--oh! a pistol shot in the street outside!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"""Dear, those motor cars,"" said Miss Pym, going to the window to look, and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet peas, as if those motor cars, those tyres of motor cars, were all her fault.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,121,The violent explosion which made Mrs. Dalloway jump and Miss Pym go to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to the side of the pavement precisely opposite Mulberry's shop window.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,122,"Passers-by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove-grey upholstery, before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,123,"Yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of Bond Street to Oxford Street on one side, to Atkinson's scent shop on the other, passing invisibly, inaudibly, like a cloud, swift, veil-like upon hills, falling indeed with something of a cloud's sudden sobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,124,But now mystery had brushed them with her wing; they had heard the voice of authority; the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,But nobody knew whose face had been seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"Was it the Prince of Wales's, the Queen's, the Prime Minister's?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,127,Whose face was it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,128,Nobody knew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,129,"Edgar J. Watkiss, with his roll of lead piping round his arm, said audibly, humorously of course: ""The Proime Minister's kyar.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,130,"Septimus Warren Smith, who found himself unable to pass, heard him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,"Septimus Warren Smith, aged about thirty, pale-faced, beak-nosed, wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat, with hazel eyes which had that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers apprehensive too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,132,The world has raised its whip; where will it descend?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,133,Everything had come to a standstill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,134,The throb of the motor engines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,135,"The sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside Mulberry's shop window; old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols; here a green, here a red parasol opened with a little pop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,"Mrs. Dalloway, coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink face pursed in enquiry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,137,Every one looked at the motor car.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,138,Septimus looked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,139,Boys on bicycles sprang off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,Traffic accumulated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,141,"And there the motor car stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious pattern like a tree, Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames, terrified him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,142,The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,143,"It is I who am blocking the way, he thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

843,843,"Clarissa came up, with her perfect manners, like a real hostess, and wanted to introduce him to some one--spoke as if they had never met before, which enraged him. Yet even then he admired her for it. He admired her courage; her social instinct; he admired her power of carrying things through. ""The perfect hostess,"" he said to her, whereupon she winced all over. But he meant her to feel it. He would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with Dalloway. So she left him. And he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him--laughing and talking--behind his back. There he stood by Miss Parry's chair as though he had been cut out of wood, he talking about wild flowers. Never, never had he suffered so infernally! He must have forgotten even to pretend to listen; at last he woke up; he saw Miss Parry looking rather disturbed, rather indignant, with her prominent eyes fixed. He almost cried out that he couldn't attend because he was in Hell! People began going out of the room. He heard them talking about fetching cloaks; about its being cold on the water, and so on.

And he would have a chat with whoever it might be, and so come to disregard more and more precise hours for lunch, and miss engagements, and when Daisy asked him, as she would, for a kiss, a scene, fail to come up to the scratch (though he was genuinely devoted to her)--in short it might be happier, as Mrs. Burgess said, that she should forget him, or merely remember him as he was in August , like a figure standing at the cross roads at dusk, which grows more and more remote as the dog-cart spins away, carrying her securely fastened to the back seat, though her arms are outstretched, and as she sees the figure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do anything in the world, anything, anything, anything. . . .",0.0578958837953021,0.047019173133048084,0.04488238464931445,0.005104511868882185,0.07129145572671684,0.03288431051322712,0.043839011246207385,0.04330774100631091,0.06589626148785689,-0.05031861002929125,-0.015900297806325184,0.08752075384593873,0.6500053025611013,0.8175532353975853,0.9792779774381666,0.6551973557588181,1.0880091842780433,0.45155260918870754,0.46400335732328946,1.034294355203485,0.6940373945099862,0.9645894234629164,0.7471113034007909,1.2168527887984433,-0.1853474952432732,0.4226666665062173,0.04869039753688754,-0.4402260635622619,-0.45784932390448185,-1.1800103268499171,-0.6080035096931842

3039,3039,"They had been friends, not acquaintances, friends, and she still saw Clarissa all in white going about the house with her hands full of flowers--to this day tobacco plants made her think of Bourton. But--did Peter understand?--she lacked something. Lacked what was it? She had charm; she had extraordinary charm. But to be frank (and she felt that Peter was an old friend, a real friend--did absence matter? did distance matter? She had often wanted to write to him, but torn it up, yet felt he understood, for people understand without things being said, as one realises growing old, and old she was, had been that afternoon to see her sons at Eton, where they had the mumps), to be quite frank then, how could Clarissa have done it?--married Richard Dalloway?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3052,3052,She went straight to Clarissa in a rage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3053,3053,Hugh didn't do such things!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3054,3054,"Clarissa said, the admirable Hugh!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3055,3055,Hugh's socks were without exception the most beautiful she had ever seen--and now his evening dress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3056,3056,Perfect!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3057,3057,And had he children?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3058,3058,"""Everybody in the room has six sons at Eton,"" Peter told her, except himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3059,3059,"He, thank God, had none.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3060,3060,"No sons, no daughters, no wife.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3061,3061,"Well, he didn't seem to mind, said Sally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3062,3062,"He looked younger, she thought, than any of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3063,3063,"But it had been a silly thing to do, in many ways, Peter said, to marry like that; ""a perfect goose she was,"" he said, but, he said, ""we had a splendid time of it,"" but how could that be?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3064,3064,Sally wondered; what did he mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3065,3065,and how odd it was to know him and yet not know a single thing that had happened to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3066,3066,And did he say it out of pride?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3067,3067,"Very likely, for after all it must be galling for him (though he was an oddity, a sort of sprite, not at all an ordinary man), it must be lonely at his age to have no home, nowhere to go to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3068,3068,But he must stay with them for weeks and weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3069,3069,"Of course he would; he would love to stay with them, and that was how it came out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3070,3070,All these years the Dalloways had never been once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3071,3071,Time after time they had asked them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3072,3072,Clarissa (for it was Clarissa of course) would not come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3073,3073,"For, said Sally, Clarissa was at heart a snob--one had to admit it, a snob. And it was that that was between them, she was convinced. Clarissa thought she had married beneath her, her husband being--she was proud of it--a miner's son.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3074,3074,Every penny they had he had earned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3075,3075,As a little boy (her voice trembled) he had carried great sacks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3076,3076,"(And so she would go on, Peter felt, hour after hour; the miner's son; people thought she had married beneath her; her five sons; and what was the other thing--plants, hydrangeas, syringas, very, very rare hibiscus lilies that never grow north of the Suez Canal, but she, with one gardener in a suburb near Manchester, had beds of them, positively beds! Now all that Clarissa had escaped, unmaternal as she was.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3077,3077,A snob was she?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3078,3078,"Yes, in many ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3079,3079,"Where was she, all this time?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3080,3080,It was getting late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3081,3081,"""Yet,"" said Sally, ""when I heard Clarissa was giving a party, I felt I couldn't not come--must see her again (and I'm staying in Victoria Street, practically next door). So I just came without an invitation. But,"" she whispered, ""tell me, do. Who is this?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3082,3082,"It was Mrs. Hilbery, looking for the door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3083,3083,For how late it was getting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3084,3084,"And, she murmured, as the night grew later, as people went, one found old friends; quiet nooks and corners; and the loveliest views.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3085,3085,"Did they know, she asked, that they were surrounded by an enchanted garden?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3086,3086,Lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and the sky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3087,3087,"Just a few fairy lamps, Clarissa Dalloway had said, in the back garden!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3088,3088,But she was a magician!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3089,3089,It was a park.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3090,3090,". . . And she didn't know their names, but friends she knew they were, friends without names, songs without words, always the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3091,3091,"But there were so many doors, such unexpected places, she could not find her way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3092,3092,"""Old Mrs. Hilbery,"" said Peter; but who was that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3093,3093,"that lady standing by the curtain all the evening, without speaking?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3094,3094,He knew her face; connected her with Bourton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3095,3095,Surely she used to cut up underclothes at the large table in the window?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3096,3096,"Davidson, was that her name?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3097,3097,"""Oh, that is Ellie Henderson,"" said Sally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3098,3098,Clarissa was really very hard on her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3099,3099,"She was a cousin, very poor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3100,3100,Clarissa was hard on people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3101,3101,"She was rather, said Peter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3102,3102,"Yet, said Sally, in her emotional way, with a rush of that enthusiasm which Peter used to love her for, yet dreaded a little now, so effusive she might become--how generous to her friends Clarissa was! and what a rare quality one found it, and how sometimes at night or on Christmas Day, when she counted up her blessings, she put that friendship first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3103,3103,They were young; that was it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3104,3104,Clarissa was pure-hearted; that was it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3105,3105,Peter would think her sentimental.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3106,3106,So she was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3107,3107,For she had come to feel that it was the only thing worth saying--what one felt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3108,3108,Cleverness was silly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3109,3109,One must say simply what one felt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3110,3110,"""But I do not know,"" said Peter Walsh, ""what I feel.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3111,3111,"Poor Peter, thought Sally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3112,3112,Why did not Clarissa come and talk to them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3113,3113,That was what he was longing for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3114,3114,She knew it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3115,3115,"All the time he was thinking only of Clarissa, and was fidgeting with his knife.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3116,3116,"He had not found life simple, Peter said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3117,3117,His relations with Clarissa had not been simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3118,3118,"It had spoilt his life, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3119,3119,"(They had been so intimate--he and Sally Seton, it was absurd not to say it.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3120,3120,"One could not be in love twice, he said. And what could she say? Still, it is better to have loved (but he would think her sentimental--he used to be so sharp).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3121,3121,He must come and stay with them in Manchester.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3122,3122,"That is all very true, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3123,3123,All very true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3124,3124,"He would love to come and stay with them, directly he had done what he had to do in London.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3125,3125,And Clarissa had cared for him more than she had ever cared for Richard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3126,3126,Sally was positive of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3127,3127,"""No, no, no!"" said Peter (Sally should not have said that--she went too far). That good fellow--there he was at the end of the room, holding forth, the same as ever, dear old Richard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3128,3128,Who was he talking to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3129,3129,"Sally asked, that very distinguished-looking man?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3130,3130,"Living in the wilds as she did, she had an insatiable curiosity to know who people were.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3131,3131,But Peter did not know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3132,3132,"He did not like his looks, he said, probably a Cabinet Minister.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3133,3133,"Of them all, Richard seemed to him the best, he said--the most disinterested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3134,3134,"""But what has he done?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3135,3135,Sally asked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3136,3136,"Public work, she supposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3137,3137,And were they happy together?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3138,3138,"Sally asked (she herself was extremely happy); for, she admitted, she knew nothing about them, only jumped to conclusions, as one does, for what can one know even of the people one lives with every day?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3139,3139,she asked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3140,3140,Are we not all prisoners?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3141,3141,"She had read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of his cell, and she had felt that was true of life--one scratched on the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3142,3142,"Despairing of human relationships (people were so difficult), she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women never gave her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3143,3143,"But no; he did not like cabbages; he preferred human beings, Peter said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3144,3144,"Indeed, the young are beautiful, Sally said, watching Elizabeth cross the room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3145,3145,How unlike Clarissa at her age!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3146,3146,Could he make anything of her?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3147,3147,She would not open her lips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3148,3148,"Not much, not yet, Peter admitted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3149,3149,"She was like a lily, Sally said, a lily by the side of a pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3150,3150,But Peter did not agree that we know nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3151,3151,"We know everything, he said; at least he did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3152,3152,"But these two, Sally whispered, these two coming now (and really she must go, if Clarissa did not come soon), this distinguished-looking man and his rather common-looking wife who had been talking to Richard--what could one know about people like that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3153,3153,"""That they're damnable humbugs,"" said Peter, looking at them casually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3154,3154,He made Sally laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3155,3155,But Sir William Bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3156,3156,He looked in the corner for the engraver's name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3157,3157,His wife looked too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3158,3158,Sir William Bradshaw was so interested in art.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3159,3159,"When one was young, said Peter, one was too much excited to know people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3160,3160,"Now that one was old, fifty-two to be precise (Sally was fifty-five, in body, she said, but her heart was like a girl's of twenty); now that one was mature then, said Peter, one could watch, one could understand, and one did not lose the power of feeling, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3161,3161,"No, that is true, said Sally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3162,3162,"She felt more deeply, more passionately, every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3163,3163,"It increased, he said, alas, perhaps, but one should be glad of it--it went on increasing in his experience. There was some one in India. He would like to tell Sally about her. He would like Sally to know her. She was married, he said. She had two small children. They must all come to Manchester, said Sally--he must promise before they left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3164,3164,"There's Elizabeth, he said, she feels not half what we feel, not yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3165,3165,"But, said Sally, watching Elizabeth go to her father, one can see they are devoted to each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3166,3166,She could feel it by the way Elizabeth went to her father.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3167,3167,"For her father had been looking at her, as he stood talking to the Bradshaws, and he had thought to himself, Who is that lovely girl?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3168,3168,"And suddenly he realised that it was his Elizabeth, and he had not recognised her, she looked so lovely in her pink frock!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3169,3169,Elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to Willie Titcomb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3170,3170,"So she went to him and they stood together, now that the party was almost over, looking at the people going, and the rooms getting emptier and emptier, with things scattered on the floor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3171,3171,"Even Ellie Henderson was going, nearly last of all, though no one had spoken to her, but she had wanted to see everything, to tell Edith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3172,3172,"And Richard and Elizabeth were rather glad it was over, but Richard was proud of his daughter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3173,3173,"And he had not meant to tell her, but he could not help telling her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3174,3174,"He had looked at her, he said, and he had wondered, Who is that lovely girl?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3175,3175,and it was his daughter!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3176,3176,That did make her happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3177,3177,But her poor dog was howling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3178,3178,"""Richard has improved. You are right,"" said Sally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3179,3179,"""I shall go and talk to him. I shall say goodnight. What does the brain matter,"" said Lady Rosseter, getting up, ""compared with the heart?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3180,3180,"""I will come,"" said Peter, but he sat on for a moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3181,3181,What is this terror?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3182,3182,what is this ecstasy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3183,3183,he thought to himself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3184,3184,What is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3185,3185,"It is Clarissa, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3186,3186,For there she was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
