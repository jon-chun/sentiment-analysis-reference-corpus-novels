0,mrs  dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself 
1,for lucy had her work cut out for her 
2,the doors would be taken off their hinges  rumpelmayer own men were coming 
3,and then  thought clarissa dalloway  what a morning  fresh as if issued to children on a beach 
4,what a lark 
5,what a plunge 
6,for so it had always seemed to her  when  with a little squeak of the hinges  which she could hear now  she had burst open the french windows and plunged at bourton into the open air 
7,how fresh  how calm  stiller than this of course  the air was in the early morning  like the flap of a wave  the kiss of a wave  chill and sharp and yet  for a girl of eighteen as she then was  solemn  feeling as she did  standing there at the open window  that something awful was about to happen  looking at the flowers  at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising  falling  standing and looking until peter walsh said   musing among the vegetables    was that it    i prefer men to cauliflowers   was that it  he must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace  peter walsh 
8,he would be back from india one of these days  june or july  she forgot which  for his letters were awfully dull  it was his sayings one remembered  his eyes  his pocket knife  his smile  his grumpiness and  when millions of things had utterly vanished  how strange it was   a few sayings like this about cabbages 
9,she stiffened a little on the kerb  waiting for durtnall own van to pass 
10,a charming woman  scrope purvis thought her  knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in westminster   a touch of the bird about her  of the jay  blue green  light  vivacious  though she was over fifty  and grown very white since her illness 
11,there she perched  never seeing him  waiting to cross  very upright 
12,for having lived in westminster  how many years now  over twenty   one feels even in the midst of the traffic  or waking at night  clarissa was positive  a particular hush  or solemnity  an indescribable pause  a suspense  but that might be her heart  affected  they said  by influenza  before big ben strikes 
13,there 
14,out it boomed 
15,first a warning  musical  then the hour  irrevocable 
16,the leaden circles dissolved in the air 
17,such fools we are  she thought  crossing victoria street 
18,for heaven only knows why one loves it so  how one sees it so  making it up  building it round one  tumbling it  creating it every moment afresh  but the veriest frumps  the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps  drink their downfall  do the same  cannot be dealt with  she felt positive  by acts of parliament for that very reason  they love life 
19,in people own eyes  in the swing  tramp  and trudge  in the bellow and the uproar  the carriages  motor cars  omnibuses  vans  sandwich men shuffling and swinging  brass bands  barrel organs  in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved  life  london  this moment of june 
20,for it was the middle of june 
21,the war was over  except for some one like mrs  foxcroft at the embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old manor house must go to a cousin  or lady bexborough who opened a bazaar  they said  with the telegram in her hand  john  her favourite  killed  but it was over  thank heaven  over 
22,it was june 
23,the king and queen were at the palace 
24,and everywhere  though it was still so early  there was a beating  a stirring of galloping ponies  tapping of cricket bats  lords  ascot  ranelagh and all the rest of it  wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey blue morning air  which  as the day wore on  would unwind them  and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies  whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung  the whirling young men  and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who  even now  after dancing all night  were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run  and even now  at this hour  discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery  and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds  their lovely old sea green brooches in eighteenth century settings to tempt americans  but one must economise  not buy things rashly for elizabeth   and she  too  loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion  being part of it  since her people were courtiers once in the time of the georges  she  too  was going that very night to kindle and illuminate  to give her party 
25,but how strange  on entering the park  the silence  the mist  the hum  the slow swimming happy ducks  the pouched birds waddling  and who should be coming along with his back against the government buildings  most appropriately  carrying a despatch box stamped with the royal arms  who but hugh whitbread  her old friend hugh  the admirable hugh 
26, good morning to you  clarissa   said hugh  rather extravagantly  for they had known each other as children 
27, where are you off to  
28, i love walking in london   said mrs  dalloway 
29, really it is better than walking in the country  
30,they had just come up  unfortunately  to see doctors 
31,other people came to see pictures  go to the opera  take their daughters out  the whitbreads came  to see doctors  
32,times without number clarissa had visited evelyn whitbread in a nursing home 
33,was evelyn ill again 
34,evelyn was a good deal out of sorts  said hugh  intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well covered  manly  extremely handsome  perfectly upholstered body  he was almost too well dressed always  but presumably had to be  with his little job at court  that his wife had some internal ailment  nothing serious  which  as an old friend  clarissa dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify 
35,ah yes  she did of course  what a nuisance  and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat 
36,not the right hat for the early morning  was that it 
37,for hugh always made her feel  as he bustled on  raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen  and of course he was coming to her party to night  evelyn absolutely insisted  only a little late he might be after the party at the palace to which he had to take one of jim own boys   she always felt a little skimpy beside hugh  schoolgirlish  but attached to him  partly from having known him always  but she did think him a good sort in his own way  though richard was nearly driven mad by him  and as for peter walsh  he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him 
38,she could remember scene after scene at bourton  peter furious  hugh not  of course  his match in any way  but still not a positive imbecile as peter made out  not a mere barber own block 
39,when his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to bath he did it  without a word  he was really unselfish  and as for saying  as peter did  that he had no heart  no brain  nothing but the manners and breeding of an english gentleman  that was only her dear peter at his worst  and he could be intolerable  he could be impossible  but adorable to walk with on a morning like this 
40, june had drawn out every leaf on the trees  the mothers of pimlico gave suck to their young  messages were passing from the fleet to the admiralty  arlington street and piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air in the park and lift its leaves hotly  brilliantly  on waves of that divine vitality which clarissa loved  to dance  to ride  she had adored all that  
41,for they might be parted for hundreds of years  she and peter  she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks  but suddenly it would come over her  if he were with me now what would he say   some days  some sights bringing him back to her calmly  without the old bitterness  which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people  they came back in the middle of st  james own park on a fine morning  indeed they did 
42,but peter  however beautiful the day might be  and the trees and the grass  and the little girl in pink  peter never saw a thing of all that 
43,he would put on his spectacles  if she told him to  he would look 
44,it was the state of the world that interested him  wagner  pope own poetry  people own characters eternally  and the defects of her own soul 
45,how he scolded her 
46,how they argued 
47,she would marry a prime minister and stand at the top of a staircase  the perfect hostess he called her  she had cried over it in her bedroom   she had the makings of the perfect hostess  he said 
48,so she would still find herself arguing in st  james own park  still making out that she had been right  and she had too  not to marry him 
49,for in marriage a little licence  a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house  which richard gave her  and she him 
50, where was he this morning for instance  some committee  she never asked what  
51,but with peter everything had to be shared  everything gone into 
52,and it was intolerable  and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain  she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed  both of them ruined  she was convinced  though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief  the anguish  and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to india 
53,never should she forget all that 
54,cold  heartless  a prude  he called her 
55,never could she understand how he cared 
56,but those indian women did presumably  silly  pretty  flimsy nincompoops  and she wasted her pity  for he was quite happy  he assured her  perfectly happy  though he had never done a thing that they talked of  his whole life had been a failure 
57,it made her angry still 
58,she had reached the park gates 
59,she stood for a moment  looking at the omnibuses in piccadilly 
60,she would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that 
61,she felt very young  at the same time unspeakably aged 
62,she sliced like a knife through everything  at the same time was outside  looking on 
63,she had a perpetual sense  as she watched the taxi cabs  of being out  out  far out to sea and alone  she always had the feeling that it was very  very dangerous to live even one day 
64,not that she thought herself clever  or much out of the ordinary 
65,how she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge fr ulein daniels gave them she could not think 
66,she knew nothing  no language  no history  she scarcely read a book now  except memoirs in bed  and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing  all this  the cabs passing  and she would not say of peter  she would not say of herself  i am this  i am that 
67,her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct  she thought  walking on 
68,if you put her in a room with some one  up went her back like a cat own  or she purred 
69,devonshire house  bath house  the house with the china cockatoo  she had seen them all lit up once  and remembered sylvia  fred  sally seton  such hosts of people  and dancing all night  and the waggons plodding past to market  and driving home across the park 
70,she remembered once throwing a shilling into the serpentine 
71,but every one remembered  what she loved was this  here  now  in front of her  the fat lady in the cab 
72,did it matter then  she asked herself  walking towards bond street  did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely  all this must go on without her  did she resent it  or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely 
73,but that somehow in the streets of london  on the ebb and flow of things  here  there  she survived  peter survived  lived in each other  she being part  she was positive  of the trees at home  of the house there  ugly  rambling all to bits and pieces as it was  part of people she had never met  being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best  who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist  but it spread ever so far  her life  herself 
74,but what was she dreaming as she looked into hatchards  shop window 
75,what was she trying to recover 
76,what image of white dawn in the country  as she read in the book spread open 
77,fear no more the heat of the sun nor the furious winter own rages 
78,this late age of the world own experience had bred in them all  all men and women  a well of tears 
79,tears and sorrows  courage and endurance  a perfectly upright and stoical bearing 
80,think  for example  of the woman she admired most  lady bexborough  opening the bazaar 
81,there were jorrocks  jaunts and jollities  there were soapy sponge and mrs  asquith own memoirs and big game shooting in nigeria  all spread open 
82,ever so many books there were  but none that seemed exactly right to take to evelyn whitbread in her nursing home 
83,nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried up little woman look  as clarissa came in  just for a moment cordial  before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women own ailments 
84,how much she wanted it  that people should look pleased as she came in  clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards bond street  annoyed  because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things 
85,much rather would she have been one of those people like richard who did things for themselves  whereas  she thought  waiting to cross  half the time she did things not simply  not for themselves  but to make people think this or that  perfect idiocy she knew  and now the policeman held up his hand  for no one was ever for a second taken in 
86,oh if she could have had her life over again  she thought  stepping on to the pavement  could have looked even differently 
87,she would have been  in the first place  dark like lady bexborough  with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes 
88,she would have been  like lady bexborough  slow and stately  rather large  interested in politics like a man  with a country house  very dignified  very sincere 
89,instead of which she had a narrow pea stick figure  a ridiculous little face  beaked like a bird own 
90,that she held herself well was true  and had nice hands and feet  and dressed well  considering that she spent little 
91,but often now this body she wore  she stopped to look at a dutch picture   this body  with all its capacities  seemed nothing  nothing at all 
92,she had the oddest sense of being herself invisible  unseen  unknown  there being no more marrying  no more having of children now  but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them  up bond street  this being mrs  dalloway  not even clarissa any more  this being mrs  richard dalloway 
93,bond street fascinated her  bond street early in the morning in the season  its flags flying  its shops  no splash  no glitter  one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty years  a few pearls  salmon on an iceblock 
94, that is all   she said  looking at the fishmonger own 
95, that is all   she repeated  pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where  before the war  you could buy almost perfect gloves 
96,and her old uncle william used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves 
97,he had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the war 
98,he had said   i have had enough  
99,gloves and shoes  she had a passion for gloves  but her own daughter  her elizabeth  cared not a straw for either of them 
100,not a straw  she thought  going on up bond street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party 
101,elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all 
102,the whole house this morning smelt of tar 
103,still  better poor grizzle than miss kilman  better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book 
104,better anything  she was inclined to say 
105,but it might be only a phase  as richard said  such as all girls go through 
106,it might be falling in love 
107,but why with miss kilman 
108,who had been badly treated of course  one must make allowances for that  and richard said she was very able  had a really historical mind 
109,anyhow they were inseparable  and elizabeth  her own daughter  went to communion  and how she dressed  how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit  it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous  so did causes   dulled their feelings  for miss kilman would do anything for the russians  starved herself for the austrians  but in private inflicted positive torture  so insensitive was she  dressed in a green mackintosh coat 
110,year in year out she wore that coat  she perspired  she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority  your inferiority  how poor she was  how rich you were  how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be  all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it  her dismissal from school during the war  poor embittered unfortunate creature 
111,for it was not her one hated but the idea of her  which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not miss kilman  had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night  one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life blood  dominators and tyrants  for no doubt with another throw of the dice  had the black been uppermost and not the white  she would have loved miss kilman 
112,but not in this world 
113,it rasped her  though  to have stirring about in her this brutal monster  to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf encumbered forest  the soul  never to be content quite  or quite secure  for at any moment the brute would be stirring  this hatred  which  especially since her illness  had power to make her feel scraped  hurt in her spine  gave her physical pain  and made all pleasure in beauty  in friendship  in being well  in being loved and making her home delightful rock  quiver  and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots  as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love  this hatred 
114,nonsense  nonsense  she cried to herself  pushing through the swing doors of mulberry own the florists 
115,she advanced  light  tall  very upright  to be greeted at once by button faced miss pym  whose hands were always bright red  as if they had been stood in cold water with the flowers 
116,there were flowers  delphiniums  sweet peas  bunches of lilac  and carnations  masses of carnations 
117,there were roses  there were irises 
118,ah yes  so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to miss pym who owed her help  and thought her kind  for kind she had been years ago  very kind  but she looked older  this year  turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed  snuffing in  after the street uproar  the delicious scent  the exquisite coolness  and then  opening her eyes  how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked  and dark and prim the red carnations  holding their heads up  and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls  tinged violet  snow white  pale  as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer own day  with its almost blue black sky  its delphiniums  its carnations  its arum lilies was over  and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower  roses  carnations  irises  lilac  glows  white  violet  red  deep orange  every flower seems to burn by itself  softly  purely in the misty beds  and how she loved the grey white moths spinning in and out  over the cherry pie  over the evening primroses 
119,and as she began to go with miss pym from jar to jar  choosing  nonsense  nonsense  she said to herself  more and more gently  as if this beauty  this scent  this colour  and miss pym liking her  trusting her  were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred  that monster  surmount it all  and it lifted her up and up when  oh  a pistol shot in the street outside 
120, dear  those motor cars   said miss pym  going to the window to look  and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet peas  as if those motor cars  those tyres of motor cars  were all her fault 
121,the violent explosion which made mrs  dalloway jump and miss pym go to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to the side of the pavement precisely opposite mulberry own shop window 
122,passers by who  of course  stopped and stared  had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove grey upholstery  before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey 
123,yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of bond street to oxford street on one side  to atkinson own scent shop on the other  passing invisibly  inaudibly  like a cloud  swift  veil like upon hills  falling indeed with something of a cloud own sudden sobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly 
124,but now mystery had brushed them with her wing  they had heard the voice of authority  the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide 
125,but nobody knew whose face had been seen 
126,was it the prince of wales own  the queen own  the prime minister own 
127,whose face was it 
128,nobody knew 
129,edgar j  watkiss  with his roll of lead piping round his arm  said audibly  humorously of course   the proime minister own kyar  
130,septimus warren smith  who found himself unable to pass  heard him 
131,septimus warren smith  aged about thirty  pale faced  beak nosed  wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat  with hazel eyes which had that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers apprehensive too 
132,the world has raised its whip  where will it descend 
133,everything had come to a standstill 
134,the throb of the motor engines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body 
135,the sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside mulberry own shop window  old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols  here a green  here a red parasol opened with a little pop 
136,mrs  dalloway  coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas  looked out with her little pink face pursed in enquiry 
137,every one looked at the motor car 
138,septimus looked 
139,boys on bicycles sprang off 
140,traffic accumulated 
141,and there the motor car stood  with drawn blinds  and upon them a curious pattern like a tree  septimus thought  and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes  as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames  terrified him 
142,the world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames 
143,it is i who am blocking the way  he thought 
144,was he not being looked at and pointed at  was he not weighted there  rooted to the pavement  for a purpose 
145,but for what purpose 
146, let us go on  septimus   said his wife  a little woman  with large eyes in a sallow pointed face  an italian girl 
147,but lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and the tree pattern on the blinds 
148,was it the queen in there  the queen going shopping 
149,the chauffeur  who had been opening something  turning something  shutting something  got on to the box 
150, come on   said lucrezia 
151,but her husband  for they had been married four  five years now  jumped  started  and said   all right   angrily  as if she had interrupted him 
152,people must notice  people must see 
153,people  she thought  looking at the crowd staring at the motor car  the english people  with their children and their horses and their clothes  which she admired in a way  but they were  people  now  because septimus had said   i will kill myself   an awful thing to say 
154,suppose they had heard him 
155,she looked at the crowd 
156,help  help  she wanted to cry out to butchers  boys and women 
157,help 
158,only last autumn she and septimus had stood on the embankment wrapped in the same cloak and  septimus reading a paper instead of talking  she had snatched it from him and laughed in the old man own face who saw them 
159,but failure one conceals 
160,she must take him away into some park 
161, now we will cross   she said 
162,she had a right to his arm  though it was without feeling 
163,he would give her  who was so simple  so impulsive  only twenty four  without friends in england  who had left italy for his sake  a piece of bone 
164,the motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable reserve proceeded towards piccadilly  still gazed at  still ruffling the faces on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of veneration whether for queen  prince  or prime minister nobody knew 
165,the face itself had been seen only once by three people for a few seconds 
166,even the sex was now in dispute 
167,but there could be no doubt that greatness was seated within  greatness was passing  hidden  down bond street  removed only by a hand own breadth from ordinary people who might now  for the first and last time  be within speaking distance of the majesty of england  of the enduring symbol of the state which will be known to curious antiquaries  sifting the ruins of time  when london is a grass grown path and all those hurrying along the pavement this wednesday morning are but bones with a few wedding rings mixed up in their dust and the gold stoppings of innumerable decayed teeth 
168,the face in the motor car will then be known 
169,it is probably the queen  thought mrs  dalloway  coming out of mulberry own with her flowers  the queen 
170,and for a second she wore a look of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight while the car passed at a foot own pace  with its blinds drawn 
171,the queen going to some hospital  the queen opening some bazaar  thought clarissa 
172,the crush was terrific for the time of day 
173,lords  ascot  hurlingham  what was it 
174,she wondered  for the street was blocked 
175,the british middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses with parcels and umbrellas  yes  even furs on a day like this  were  she thought  more ridiculous  more unlike anything there has ever been than one could conceive  and the queen herself held up  the queen herself unable to pass 
176,clarissa was suspended on one side of brook street  sir john buckhurst  the old judge on the other  with the car between them  sir john had laid down the law for years and liked a well dressed woman  when the chauffeur  leaning ever so slightly  said or showed something to the policeman  who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through 
177,slowly and very silently it took its way 
178,clarissa guessed  clarissa knew of course  she had seen something white  magical  circular  in the footman own hand  a disc inscribed with a name   the queen own  the prince of wales own  the prime minister own   which  by force of its own lustre  burnt its way through  clarissa saw the car diminishing  disappearing   to blaze among candelabras  glittering stars  breasts stiff with oak leaves  hugh whitbread and all his colleagues  the gentlemen of england  that night in buckingham palace 
179,and clarissa  too  gave a party 
180,she stiffened a little  so she would stand at the top of her stairs 
181,the car had gone  but it had left a slight ripple which flowed through glove shops and hat shops and tailors  shops on both sides of bond street 
182,for thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way  to the window  choosing a pair of gloves  should they be to the elbow or above it  lemon or pale grey   ladies stopped  when the sentence was finished something had happened 
183,something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument  though capable of transmitting shocks in china  could register the vibration  yet in its fulness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional  for in all the hat shops and tailors  shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead  of the flag  of empire 
184,in a public house in a back street a colonial insulted the house of windsor which led to words  broken beer glasses  and a general shindy  which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings 
185,for the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound 
186,gliding across piccadilly  the car turned down st  james own street 
187,tall men  men of robust physique  well dressed men with their tail coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who  for reasons difficult to discriminate  were standing in the bow window of brooks own with their hands behind the tails of their coats  looking out  perceived instinctively that greatness was passing  and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon clarissa dalloway 
188,at once they stood even straighter  and removed their hands  and seemed ready to attend their sovereign  if need be  to the cannon own mouth  as their ancestors had done before them 
189,the white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the tatler and syphons of soda water seemed to approve  seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of england  and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral 
190,shawled moll pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well  it was the prince of wales for certain  and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer  a bunch of roses  into st  james own street out of sheer light heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable own eye upon her  discouraging an old irishwoman own loyalty 
191,the sentries at st  james own saluted  queen alexandra own policeman approved 
192,a small crowd meanwhile had gathered at the gates of buckingham palace 
193,listlessly  yet confidently  poor people all of them  they waited  looked at the palace itself with the flag flying  at victoria  billowing on her mound  admired her shelves of running water  her geraniums  singled out from the motor cars in the mall first this one  then that  bestowed emotion  vainly  upon commoners out for a drive  recalled their tribute to keep it unspent while this car passed and that  and all the time let rumour accumulate in their veins and thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of royalty looking at them  the queen bowing  the prince saluting  at the thought of the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon kings  of the equerries and deep curtsies  of the queen own old doll own house  of princess mary married to an englishman  and the prince  ah  the prince  who took wonderfully  they said  after old king edward  but was ever so much slimmer 
194,the prince lived at st  james own  but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother 
195,so sarah bletchley said with her baby in her arms  tipping her foot up and down as though she were by her own fender in pimlico  but keeping her eyes on the mall  while emily coates ranged over the palace windows and thought of the housemaids  the innumerable housemaids  the bedrooms  the innumerable bedrooms 
196,joined by an elderly gentleman with an aberdeen terrier  by men without occupation  the crowd increased 
197,little mr  bowley  who had rooms in the albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life but could be unsealed suddenly  inappropriately  sentimentally  by this sort of thing  poor women waiting to see the queen go past  poor women  nice little children  orphans  widows  the war  tut tut  actually had tears in his eyes 
198,a breeze flaunting ever so warmly down the mall through the thin trees  past the bronze heroes  lifted some flag flying in the british breast of mr  bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the mall and held it high as the car approached  and let the poor mothers of pimlico press close to him  and stood very upright 
199,the car came on 
200,suddenly mrs  coates looked up into the sky 
201,the sound of an aeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd 
202,there it was coming over the trees  letting out white smoke from behind  which curled and twisted  actually writing something  making letters in the sky 
203,every one looked up 
204,dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up  curved in a loop  raced  sank  rose  and whatever it did  wherever it went  out fluttered behind it a thick ruffled bar of white smoke which curled and wreathed upon the sky in letters 
205,but what letters 
206,a c was it 
207,an e  then an l 
208,only for a moment did they lie still  then they moved and melted and were rubbed out up in the sky  and the aeroplane shot further away and again  in a fresh space of sky  began writing a k  an e  a y perhaps 
209, glaxo   said mrs  coates in a strained  awe stricken voice  gazing straight up  and her baby  lying stiff and white in her arms  gazed straight up 
210, kreemo   murmured mrs  bletchley  like a sleep walker 
211,with his hat held out perfectly still in his hand  mr  bowley gazed straight up 
212,all down the mall people were standing and looking up into the sky 
213,as they looked the whole world became perfectly silent  and a flight of gulls crossed the sky  first one gull leading  then another  and in this extraordinary silence and peace  in this pallor  in this purity  bells struck eleven times  the sound fading up there among the gulls 
214,the aeroplane turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked  swiftly  freely  like a skater  
215, that is an e   said mrs  bletchley  or a dancer  
216, it is toffee   murmured mr  bowley   and the car went in at the gates and nobody looked at it   and shutting off the smoke  away and away it rushed  and the smoke faded and assembled itself round the broad white shapes of the clouds 
217,it had gone  it was behind the clouds 
218,there was no sound 
219,the clouds to which the letters e  g  or l had attached themselves moved freely  as if destined to cross from west to east on a mission of the greatest importance which would never be revealed  and yet certainly so it was  a mission of the greatest importance  then suddenly  as a train comes out of a tunnel  the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds again  the sound boring into the ears of all people in the mall  in the green park  in piccadilly  in regent street  in regent own park  and the bar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down  and it soared up and wrote one letter after another  but what word was it writing 
220,lucrezia warren smith  sitting by her husband own side on a seat in regent own park in the broad walk  looked up 
221, look  look  septimus   she cried 
222,for dr  holmes had told her to make her husband  who had nothing whatever seriously the matter with him but was a little out of sorts  take an interest in things outside himself 
223,so  thought septimus  looking up  they are signalling to me 
224,not indeed in actual words  that is  he could not read the language yet  but it was plain enough  this beauty  this exquisite beauty  and tears filled his eyes as he looked at the smoke words languishing and melting in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and signalling their intention to provide him  for nothing  for ever  for looking merely  with beauty  more beauty 
225,tears ran down his cheeks 
226,it was toffee  they were advertising toffee  a nursemaid told rezia 
227,together they began to spell t       o       f
228, k       are        said the nursemaid  and septimus heard her say  kay arr  close to his ear  deeply  softly  like a mellow organ  but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper own  which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound which  concussing  broke 
229,a marvellous discovery indeed  that the human voice in certain atmospheric conditions  for one must be scientific  above all scientific  can quicken trees into life 
230,happily rezia put her hand with a tremendous weight on his knee so that he was weighted down  transfixed  or the excitement of the elm trees rising and falling  rising and falling with all their leaves alight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to the green of a hollow wave  like plumes on horses  heads  feathers on ladies   so proudly they rose and fell  so superbly  would have sent him mad 
231,but he would not go mad 
232,he would shut his eyes  he would see no more 
233,but they beckoned  leaves were alive  trees were alive 
234,and the leaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body  there on the seat  fanned it up and down  when the branch stretched he  too  made that statement 
235,the sparrows fluttering  rising  and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern  the white and blue  barred with black branches 
236,sounds made harmonies with premeditation  the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds 
237,a child cried 
238,rightly far away a horn sounded 
239,all taken together meant the birth of a new religion  
240, septimus   said rezia 
241,he started violently 
242,people must notice 
243, i am going to walk to the fountain and back   she said 
244,for she could stand it no longer 
245,dr  holmes might say there was nothing the matter 
246,far rather would she that he were dead 
247,she could not sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made everything terrible  sky and tree  children playing  dragging carts  blowing whistles  falling down  all were terrible 
248,and he would not kill himself  and she could tell no one 
249, septimus has been working too hard   that was all she could say to her own mother  to love makes one solitary  she thought  she could tell nobody  not even septimus now  and looking back  she saw him sitting in his shabby overcoat alone  on the seat  hunched up  staring  and it was cowardly for a man to say he would kill himself  but septimus had fought  he was brave  he was not septimus now  she put on her lace collar  she put on her new hat and he never noticed  and he was happy without her  nothing could make her happy without him  nothing  he was selfish  so men are  for he was not ill  dr  holmes said there was nothing the matter with him  she spread her hand before her  look  her wedding ring slipped  she had grown so thin 
250,it was she who suffered  but she had nobody to tell 
251,far was italy and the white houses and the room where her sisters sat making hats  and the streets crowded every evening with people walking  laughing out loud  not half alive like people here  huddled up in bath chairs  looking at a few ugly flowers stuck in pots 
252, for you should see the milan gardens   she said aloud 
253,but to whom 
254,there was nobody 
255,her words faded 
256,so a rocket fades 
257,its sparks  having grazed their way into the night  surrender to it  dark descends  pours over the outlines of houses and towers  bleak hillsides soften and fall in 
258,but though they are gone  the night is full of them  robbed of colour  blank of windows  they exist more ponderously  give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit  the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness  huddled together in the darkness  reft of the relief which dawn brings when  washing the walls white and grey  spotting each window pane  lifting the mist from the fields  showing the red brown cows peacefully grazing  all is once more decked out to the eye  exists again 
259,i am alone  i am alone  she cried  by the fountain in regent own park  staring at the indian and his cross   as perhaps at midnight  when all boundaries are lost  the country reverts to its ancient shape  as the romans saw it  lying cloudy  when they landed  and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where  such was her darkness  when suddenly  as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it  she said how she was his wife  married years ago in milan  his wife  and would never  never tell that he was mad  turning  the shelf fell  down  down she dropped  for he was gone  she thought  gone  as he threatened  to kill himself  to throw himself under a cart 
260,but no  there he was  still sitting alone on the seat  in his shabby overcoat  his legs crossed  staring  talking aloud 
261,men must not cut down trees 
262,there is a god 
263, he noted such revelations on the backs of envelopes  
264,change the world 
265,no one kills from hatred 
266,make it known  he wrote it down  
267,he waited 
268,he listened 
269,a sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped septimus  septimus  four or five times over and went on  drawing its notes out  to sing freshly and piercingly in greek words how there is no crime and  joined by another sparrow  they sang in voices prolonged and piercing in greek words  from trees in the meadow of life beyond a river where the dead walk  how there is no death 
270,there was his hand  there the dead 
271,white things were assembling behind the railings opposite 
272,but he dared not look 
273,evans was behind the railings 
274, what are you saying   said rezia suddenly  sitting down by him 
275,interrupted again 
276,she was always interrupting 
277,away from people  they must get away from people  he said  jumping up   right away over there  where there were chairs beneath a tree and the long slope of the park dipped like a length of green stuff with a ceiling cloth of blue and pink smoke high above  and there was a rampart of far irregular houses hazed in smoke  the traffic hummed in a circle  and on the right  dun coloured animals stretched long necks over the zoo palings  barking  howling 
278,there they sat down under a tree 
279, look   she implored him  pointing at a little troop of boys carrying cricket stumps  and one shuffled  spun round on his heel and shuffled  as if he were acting a clown at the music hall 
280, look   she implored him  for dr  holmes had told her to make him notice real things  go to a music hall  play cricket  that was the very game  dr  holmes said  a nice out of door game  the very game for her husband 
281, look   she repeated 
282,look the unseen bade him  the voice which now communicated with him who was the greatest of mankind  septimus  lately taken from life to death  the lord who had come to renew society  who lay like a coverlet  a snow blanket smitten only by the sun  for ever unwasted  suffering for ever  the scapegoat  the eternal sufferer  but he did not want it  he moaned  putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering  that eternal loneliness 
283, look   she repeated  for he must not talk aloud to himself out of doors 
284, oh look   she implored him 
285,but what was there to look at 
286,a few sheep 
287,that was all 
288,the way to regent own park tube station  could they tell her the way to regent own park tube station  maisie johnson wanted to know 
289,she was only up from edinburgh two days ago 
290, not this way  over there  
291,rezia exclaimed  waving her aside  lest she should see septimus 
292,both seemed queer  maisie johnson thought 
293,everything seemed very queer 
294,in london for the first time  come to take up a post at her uncle own in leadenhall street  and now walking through regent own park in the morning  this couple on the chairs gave her quite a turn  the young woman seeming foreign  the man looking queer  so that should she be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again among her memories how she had walked through regent own park on a fine summer own morning fifty years ago 
295,for she was only nineteen and had got her way at last  to come to london  and now how queer it was  this couple she had asked the way of  and the girl started and jerked her hand  and the man  he seemed awfully odd  quarrelling  perhaps  parting for ever  perhaps  something was up  she knew  and now all these people  for she returned to the broad walk   the stone basins  the prim flowers  the old men and women  invalids most of them in bath chairs  all seemed  after edinburgh  so queer 
296,and maisie johnson  as she joined that gently trudging  vaguely gazing  breeze kissed company  squirrels perching and preening  sparrow fountains fluttering for crumbs  dogs busy with the railings  busy with each other  while the soft warm air washed over them and lent to the fixed unsurprised gaze with which they received life something whimsical and mollified  maisie johnson positively felt she must cry oh 
297, for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn  something was up  she knew  
298,horror  horror  she wanted to cry 
299, she had left her people  they had warned her what would happen  
300,why had not she stayed at home 
301,she cried  twisting the knob of the iron railing 
302,that girl  thought mrs  dempster  who saved crusts for the squirrels and often ate her lunch in regent own park   do not know a thing yet  and really it seemed to her better to be a little stout  a little slack  a little moderate in one own expectations 
303,percy drank 
304,well  better to have a son  thought mrs  dempster 
305,she had had a hard time of it  and could not help smiling at a girl like that 
306,you will get married  for you are pretty enough  thought mrs  dempster 
307,get married  she thought  and then you will know 
308,oh  the cooks  and so on 
309,every man has his ways 
310,but whether I would have chosen quite like that if i could have known  thought mrs  dempster  and could not help wishing to whisper a word to maisie johnson  to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity 
311,for it is been a hard life  thought mrs  dempster 
312,what had not she given to it 
313,roses  figure  her feet too 
314, she drew the knobbed lumps beneath her skirt  
315,roses  she thought sardonically 
316,all trash  m dear 
317,for really  what with eating  drinking  and mating  the bad days and good  life had been no mere matter of roses  and what was more  let me tell you  carrie dempster had no wish to change her lot with any woman own in kentish town 
318,but  she implored  pity 
319,pity  for the loss of roses 
320,pity she asked of maisie johnson  standing by the hyacinth beds 
321,ah  but that aeroplane 
322,had not mrs  dempster always longed to see foreign parts 
323,she had a nephew  a missionary 
324,it soared and shot 
325,she always went on the sea at margate  not out of sight of land  but she had no patience with women who were afraid of water 
326,it swept and fell 
327,her stomach was in her mouth 
328,up again 
329,there is a fine young feller aboard of it  mrs  dempster wagered  and away and away it went  fast and fading  away and away the aeroplane shot  soaring over greenwich and all the masts  over the little island of grey churches  st  paul own and the rest till  on either side of london  fields spread out and dark brown woods where adventurous thrushes hopping boldly  glancing quickly  snatched the snail and tapped him on a stone  once  twice  thrice 
330,away and away the aeroplane shot  till it was nothing but a bright spark  an aspiration  a concentration  a symbol  so it seemed to mr  bentley  vigorously rolling his strip of turf at greenwich  of man own soul  of his determination  thought mr  bentley  sweeping round the cedar tree  to get outside his body  beyond his house  by means of thought  einstein  speculation  mathematics  the mendelian theory  away the aeroplane shot 
331,then  while a seedy looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag stood on the steps of st  paul own cathedral  and hesitated  for within was what balm  how great a welcome  how many tombs with banners waving over them  tokens of victories not over armies  but over  he thought  that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at present without a situation  and more than that  the cathedral offers company  he thought  invites you to membership of a society  great men belong to it  martyrs have died for it  why not enter in  he thought  put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar  a cross  the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and questing and knocking of words together and has become all spirit  disembodied  ghostly  why not enter in 
332,he thought and while he hesitated out flew the aeroplane over ludgate circus 
333,it was strange  it was still 
334,not a sound was to be heard above the traffic 
335,unguided it seemed  sped of its own free will 
336,and now  curving up and up  straight up  like something mounting in ecstasy  in pure delight  out from behind poured white smoke looping  writing a t  an o  an f 
337, what are they looking at   said clarissa dalloway to the maid who opened her door 
338,the hall of the house was cool as a vault 
339,mrs  dalloway raised her hand to her eyes  and  as the maid shut the door to  and she heard the swish of lucy own skirts  she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the response to old devotions 
340,the cook whistled in the kitchen 
341,she heard the click of the typewriter 
342,it was her life  and  bending her head over the hall table  she bowed beneath the influence  felt blessed and purified  saying to herself  as she took the pad with the telephone message on it  how moments like this are buds on the tree of life  flowers of darkness they are  she thought  as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only   not for a moment did she believe in god  but all the more  she thought  taking up the pad  must one repay in daily life to servants  yes  to dogs and canaries  above all to richard her husband  who was the foundation of it  of the gay sounds  of the green lights  of the cook even whistling  for mrs  walker was irish and whistled all day long  one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments  she thought  lifting the pad  while lucy stood by her  trying to explain how
343, mr  dalloway  madam   
344,clarissa read on the telephone pad   lady bruton wishes to know if mr  dalloway will lunch with her to day  
345, mr  dalloway  madam  told me to tell you he would be lunching out  
346, dear   said clarissa  and lucy shared as she meant her to her disappointment  but not the pang   felt the concord between them  took the hint  thought how the gentry love  gilded her own future with calm  and  taking mrs  dalloway own parasol  handled it like a sacred weapon which a goddess  having acquitted herself honourably in the field of battle  sheds  and placed it in the umbrella stand 
347, fear no more   said clarissa 
348,fear no more the heat of the sun  for the shock of lady bruton asking richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver  as a plant on the river bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers  so she rocked  so she shivered 
349,millicent bruton  whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing  had not asked her 
350,no vulgar jealousy could separate her from richard 
351,but she feared time itself  and read on lady bruton own face  as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone  the dwindling of life  how year by year her share was sliced  how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching  of absorbing  as in the youthful years  the colours  salts  tones of existence  so that she filled the room she entered  and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing room  an exquisite suspense  such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him  and the waves which threaten to break  but only gently split their surface  roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl 
352,she put the pad on the hall table 
353,she began to go slowly upstairs  with her hand on the bannisters  as if she had left a party  where now this friend now that had flashed back her face  her voice  had shut the door and gone out and stood alone  a single figure against the appalling night  or rather  to be accurate  against the stare of this matter of fact june morning  soft with the glow of rose petals for some  she knew  and felt it  as she paused by the open staircase window which let in blinds flapping  dogs barking  let in  she thought  feeling herself suddenly shrivelled  aged  breastless  the grinding  blowing  flowering of the day  out of doors  out of the window  out of her body and brain which now failed  since lady bruton  whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing  had not asked her 
354,like a nun withdrawing  or a child exploring a tower  she went upstairs  paused at the window  came to the bathroom 
355,there was the green linoleum and a tap dripping 
356,there was an emptiness about the heart of life  an attic room 
357,women must put off their rich apparel 
358,at midday they must disrobe 
359,she pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed 
360,the sheets were clean  tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side 
361,narrower and narrower would her bed be 
362,the candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in baron marbot own memoirs 
363,she had read late at night of the retreat from moscow 
364,for the house sat so long that richard insisted  after her illness  that she must sleep undisturbed 
365,and really she preferred to read of the retreat from moscow 
366,he knew it 
367,so the room was an attic  the bed narrow  and lying there reading  for she slept badly  she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet 
368,lovely in girlhood  suddenly there came a moment  for example on the river beneath the woods at clieveden  when  through some contraction of this cold spirit  she had failed him 
369,and then at constantinople  and again and again 
370,she could see what she lacked 
371,it was not beauty  it was not mind 
372,it was something central which permeated  something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman  or of women together 
373,for that she could dimly perceive 
374,she resented it  had a scruple picked up heaven knows where  or  as she felt  sent by nature  who is invariably wise   yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman  not a girl  of a woman confessing  as to her they often did  some scrape  some folly 
375,and whether it was pity  or their beauty  or that she was older  or some accident  like a faint scent  or a violin next door  so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments   she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt  only for a moment  but it was enough  it was a sudden revelation  a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then  as it spread  one yielded to its expansion  and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer  swollen with some astonishing significance  some pressure of rapture  which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores  then  for that moment  she had seen an illumination  a match burning in a crocus  an inner meaning almost expressed  but the close withdrew  the hard softened  it was over  the moment 
376,against such moments  with women too  there contrasted  as she laid her hat down  the bed and baron marbot and the candle half burnt 
377,lying awake  the floor creaked  the lit house was suddenly darkened  and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by richard  who slipped upstairs in his socks and then  as often as not  dropped his hot water bottle and swore 
378,how she laughed 
379,but this question of love  she thought  putting her coat away   this falling in love with women 
380,take sally seton  her relation in the old days with sally seton 
381,had not that  after all  been love 
382,she sat on the floor  that was her first impression of sally  she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees  smoking a cigarette 
383,where could it have been 
384,the mannings 
385,the kinloch jones own 
386,at some party  where  she could not be certain   for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with   who is that  
387,and he had told her  and said that sally own parents did not get on  how that shocked her  that one own parents should quarrel   
388,but all that evening she could not take her eyes off sally 
389,it was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired  dark  large eyed  with that quality which  since she had not got it herself  she always envied  a sort of abandonment  as if she could say anything  do anything  a quality much commoner in foreigners than in englishwomen  sally always said she had french blood in her veins  an ancestor had been with marie antoinette  had his head cut off  left a ruby ring  perhaps that summer she came to stay at bourton  walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket  one night after dinner  and upsetting poor aunt helena to such an extent that she never forgave her  there had been some quarrel at home  she literally had not a penny that night when she came to them  had pawned a brooch to come down 
390,she had rushed off in a passion 
391,they sat up till all hours of the night talking 
392,sally it was who made her feel  for the first time  how sheltered the life at bourton was 
393,she knew nothing about sex  nothing about social problems  she had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field  she had seen cows just after their calves were born 
394,but aunt helena never liked discussion of anything  when sally gave her william morris  it had to be wrapped in brown paper  
395,there they sat  hour after hour  talking in her bedroom at the top of the house  talking about life  how they were to reform the world 
396,they meant to found a society to abolish private property  and actually had a letter written  though not sent out 
397,the ideas were sally own  of course  but very soon she was just as excited  read plato in bed before breakfast  read morris  read shelley by the hour 
398,sally own power was amazing  her gift  her personality 
399,there was her way with flowers  for instance 
400,at bourton they always had stiff little vases all the way down the table 
401,sally went out  picked hollyhocks  dahlias  all sorts of flowers that had never been seen together  cut their heads off  and made them swim on the top of water in bowls 
402,the effect was extraordinary  coming in to dinner in the sunset   of course aunt helena thought it wicked to treat flowers like that   then she forgot her sponge  and ran along the passage naked  that grim old housemaid  ellen atkins  went about grumbling   suppose any of the gentlemen had seen  
403,indeed she did shock people 
404,she was untidy  papa said 
405,the strange thing  on looking back  was the purity  the integrity  of her feeling for sally 
406,it was not like one own feeling for a man 
407,it was completely disinterested  and besides  it had a quality which could only exist between women  between women just grown up 
408,it was protective  on her side  sprang from a sense of being in league together  a presentiment of something that was bound to part them  they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe   which led to this chivalry  this protective feeling which was much more on her side than sally own 
409,for in those days she was completely reckless  did the most idiotic things out of bravado  bicycled round the parapet on the terrace  smoked cigars 
410,absurd  she was  very absurd 
411,but the charm was overpowering  to her at least  so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot water can in her hands and saying aloud   she is beneath this roof        she is beneath this roof  
412,no  the words meant absolutely nothing to her now 
413,she could not even get an echo of her old emotion 
414,but she could remember going cold with excitement  and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy  now the old feeling began to come back to her  as she took out her hairpins  laid them on the dressing table  began to do her hair   with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light  and dressing  and going downstairs  and feeling as she crossed the hall  if it were now to die  twere now to be most happy  
415,that was her feeling  othello own feeling  and she felt it  she was convinced  as strongly as shakespeare meant othello to feel it  all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet sally seton 
416,she was wearing pink gauze  was that possible 
417,she seemed  anyhow  all light  glowing  like some bird or air ball that has flown in  attached itself for a moment to a bramble 
418,but nothing is so strange when one is in love  and what was this except being in love   as the complete indifference of other people 
419,aunt helena just wandered off after dinner  papa read the paper 
420,peter walsh might have been there  and old miss cummings  joseph breitkopf certainly was  for he came every summer  poor old man  for weeks and weeks  and pretended to read german with her  but really played the piano and sang brahms without any voice 
421,all this was only a background for sally 
422,she stood by the fireplace talking  in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress  to papa  who had begun to be attracted rather against his will  he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace   when suddenly she said   what a shame to sit indoors   and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down 
423,peter walsh and joseph breitkopf went on about wagner 
424,she and sally fell a little behind 
425,then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it 
426,sally stopped  picked a flower  kissed her on the lips 
427,the whole world might have turned upside down 
428,the others disappeared  there she was alone with sally 
429,and she felt that she had been given a present  wrapped up  and told just to keep it  not to look at it  a diamond  something infinitely precious  wrapped up  which  as they walked  up and down  up and down   she uncovered  or the radiance burnt through  the revelation  the religious feeling   when old joseph and peter faced them 
430, star gazing   said peter 
431,it was like running one own face against a granite wall in the darkness 
432,it was shocking  it was horrible 
433,not for herself 
434,she felt only how sally was being mauled already  maltreated  she felt his hostility  his jealousy  his determination to break into their companionship 
435,all this she saw as one sees a landscape in a flash of lightning  and sally  never had she admired her so much   gallantly taking her way unvanquished 
436,she laughed 
437,she made old joseph tell her the names of the stars  which he liked doing very seriously 
438,she stood there  she listened 
439,she heard the names of the stars 
440, oh this horror   she said to herself  as if she had known all along that something would interrupt  would embitter her moment of happiness 
441,yet  after all  how much she owed to him later 
442,always when she thought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason  because she wanted his good opinion so much  perhaps 
443,she owed him words   sentimental    civilised   they started up every day of her life as if he guarded her 
444,a book was sentimental  an attitude to life sentimental 
445, sentimental   perhaps she was to be thinking of the past 
446,what would he think  she wondered  when he came back 
447,that she had grown older 
448,would he say that  or would she see him thinking when he came back  that she had grown older 
449,it was true 
450,since her illness she had turned almost white 
451,laying her brooch on the table  she had a sudden spasm  as if  while she mused  the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her 
452,she was not old yet 
453,she had just broken into her fifty second year 
454,months and months of it were still untouched 
455,june  july  august 
456,each still remained almost whole  and  as if to catch the falling drop  clarissa  crossing to the dressing table  plunged into the very heart of the moment  transfixed it  there  the moment of this june morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings  seeing the glass  the dressing table  and all the bottles afresh  collecting the whole of her at one point  as she looked into the glass   seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party  of clarissa dalloway  of herself 
457,how many million times she had seen her face  and always with the same imperceptible contraction 
458,she pursed her lips when she looked in the glass 
459,it was to give her face point 
460,that was her self  pointed  dartlike  definite 
461,that was her self when some effort  some call on her to be her self  drew the parts together  she alone knew how different  how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre  one diamond  one woman who sat in her drawing room and made a meeting point  a radiancy no doubt in some dull lives  a refuge for the lonely to come to  perhaps  she had helped young people  who were grateful to her  had tried to be the same always  never showing a sign of all the other sides of her  faults  jealousies  vanities  suspicions  like this of lady bruton not asking her to lunch  which  she thought  combing her hair finally   is utterly base 
462,now  where was her dress 
463,her evening dresses hung in the cupboard 
464,clarissa  plunging her hand into the softness  gently detached the green dress and carried it to the window 
465,she had torn it 
466,some one had trod on the skirt 
467,she had felt it give at the embassy party at the top among the folds 
468,by artificial light the green shone  but lost its colour now in the sun 
469,she would mend it 
470,her maids had too much to do 
471,she would wear it to night 
472,she would take her silks  her scissors  her  what was it   her thimble  of course  down into the drawing room  for she must also write  and see that things generally were more or less in order 
473,strange  she thought  pausing on the landing  and assembling that diamond shape  that single person  strange how a mistress knows the very moment  the very temper of her house 
474,faint sounds rose in spirals up the well of the stairs  the swish of a mop  tapping  knocking  a loudness when the front door opened  a voice repeating a message in the basement  the chink of silver on a tray  clean silver for the party 
475,all was for the party 
476, and lucy  coming into the drawing room with her tray held out  put the giant candlesticks on the mantelpiece  the silver casket in the middle  turned the crystal dolphin towards the clock  they would come  they would stand  they would talk in the mincing tones which she could imitate  ladies and gentlemen  of all  her mistress was loveliest  mistress of silver  of linen  of china  for the sun  the silver  doors off their hinges  rumpelmayer own men  gave her a sense  as she laid the paper knife on the inlaid table  of something achieved  behold  behold  she said  speaking to her old friends in the baker own shop  where she had first seen service at caterham  prying into the glass  she was lady angela  attending princess mary  when in came mrs  dalloway  
477, oh lucy   she said   the silver does look nice  
478, and how   she said  turning the crystal dolphin to stand straight   how did you enjoy the play last night    oh  they had to go before the end   she said 
479, they had to be back at ten   she said 
480, so they do not know what happened   she said 
481, that does seem hard luck   she said  for her servants stayed later  if they asked her  
482, that does seem rather a shame   she said  taking the old bald looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in lucy own arms  and giving her a little push  and crying 
483, take it away  give it to mrs  walker with my compliments  take it away   she cried 
484,and lucy stopped at the drawing room door  holding the cushion  and said  very shyly  turning a little pink  could not she help to mend that dress 
485,but  said mrs  dalloway  she had enough on her hands already  quite enough of her own to do without that 
486, but  thank you  lucy  oh  thank you   said mrs  dalloway  and thank you  thank you  she went on saying  sitting down on the sofa with her dress over her knees  her scissors  her silks   thank you  thank you  she went on saying in gratitude to her servants generally for helping her to be like this  to be what she wanted  gentle  generous hearted 
487,her servants liked her 
488,and then this dress of hers  where was the tear 
489,and now her needle to be threaded 
490,this was a favourite dress  one of sally parker own  the last almost she ever made  alas  for sally had now retired  living at ealing  and if ever i have a moment  thought clarissa  but never would she have a moment any more   i shall go and see her at ealing 
491,for she was a character  thought clarissa  a real artist 
492,she thought of little out of the way things  yet her dresses were never queer 
493,you could wear them at hatfield  at buckingham palace 
494,she had worn them at hatfield  at buckingham palace 
495,quiet descended on her  calm  content  as her needle  drawing the silk smoothly to its gentle pause  collected the green folds together and attached them  very lightly  to the belt 
496,so on a summer own day waves collect  overbalance  and fall  collect and fall  and the whole world seems to be saying  that is all  more and more ponderously  until even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach says too  that is all 
497,fear no more  says the heart 
498,fear no more  says the heart  committing its burden to some sea  which sighs collectively for all sorrows  and renews  begins  collects  let us fall 
499,and the body alone listens to the passing bee  the wave breaking  the dog barking  far away barking and barking 
500, heavens  the front door bell   exclaimed clarissa  staying her needle 
501,roused  she listened 
502, mrs  dalloway will see me   said the elderly man in the hall 
503, oh yes  she will see me   he repeated  putting lucy aside very benevolently  and running upstairs ever so quickly 
504, yes  yes  yes   he muttered as he ran upstairs 
505, she will see me  after five years in india  clarissa will see me  
506, who can  what can   asked mrs  dalloway  thinking it was outrageous to be interrupted at eleven of the clock on the morning of the day she was giving a party   hearing a step on the stairs  she heard a hand upon the door  she made to hide her dress  like a virgin protecting chastity  respecting privacy  now the brass knob slipped  now the door opened  and in came  for a single second she could not remember what he was called  so surprised she was to see him  so glad  so shy  so utterly taken aback to have peter walsh come to her unexpectedly in the morning 
507, she had not read his letter  
508, and how are you   said peter walsh  positively trembling  taking both her hands  kissing both her hands 
509,she is grown older  he thought  sitting down 
510,i shall not tell her anything about it  he thought  for she is grown older 
511,she is looking at me  he thought  a sudden embarrassment coming over him  though he had kissed her hands 
512,putting his hand into his pocket  he took out a large pocket knife and half opened the blade 
513,exactly the same  thought clarissa  the same queer look  the same check suit  a little out of the straight his face is  a little thinner  dryer  perhaps  but he looks awfully well  and just the same 
514, how heavenly it is to see you again   she exclaimed 
515,he had his knife out 
516,that is so like him  she thought 
517,he had only reached town last night  he said  would have to go down into the country at once  and how was everything  how was everybody  richard 
518,elizabeth 
519, and what is all this   he said  tilting his pen knife towards her green dress 
520,he is very well dressed  thought clarissa  yet he always criticises me 
521,here she is mending her dress  mending her dress as usual  he thought  here she is been sitting all the time I have been in india  mending her dress  playing about  going to parties  running to the house and back and all that  he thought  growing more and more irritated  more and more agitated  for there is nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage  he thought  and politics  and having a conservative husband  like the admirable richard 
522,so it is  so it is  he thought  shutting his knife with a snap 
523, richard own very well  richard own at a committee   said clarissa 
524,and she opened her scissors  and said  did he mind her just finishing what she was doing to her dress  for they had a party that night 
525, which i shall not ask you to   she said 
526, my dear peter   she said 
527,but it was delicious to hear her say that  my dear peter  indeed  it was all so delicious  the silver  the chairs  all so delicious 
528,why would not she ask him to her party 
529,he asked 
530,now of course  thought clarissa  he is enchanting  perfectly enchanting 
531,now i remember how impossible it was ever to make up my mind  and why did i make up my mind  not to marry him 
532,she wondered  that awful summer 
533, but it is so extraordinary that you should have come this morning   she cried  putting her hands  one on top of another  down on her dress 
534, do you remember   she said   how the blinds used to flap at bourton  
535, they did   he said  and he remembered breakfasting alone  very awkwardly  with her father  who had died  and he had not written to clarissa 
536,but he had never got on well with old parry  that querulous  weak kneed old man  clarissa own father  justin parry 
537, i often wish I would got on better with your father   he said 
538, but he never liked any one who  our friends   said clarissa  and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding peter that he had wanted to marry her 
539,of course i did  thought peter  it almost broke my heart too  he thought  and was overcome with his own grief  which rose like a moon looked at from a terrace  ghastly beautiful with light from the sunken day 
540,i was more unhappy than I have ever been since  he thought 
541,and as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a little towards clarissa  put his hand out  raised it  let it fall 
542,there above them it hung  that moon 
543,she too seemed to be sitting with him on the terrace  in the moonlight 
544, herbert has it now   she said 
545, i never go there now   she said 
546,then  just as happens on a terrace in the moonlight  when one person begins to feel ashamed that he is already bored  and yet as the other sits silent  very quiet  sadly looking at the moon  does not like to speak  moves his foot  clears his throat  notices some iron scroll on a table leg  stirs a leaf  but says nothing  so peter walsh did now 
547,for why go back like this to the past 
548,he thought 
549,why make him think of it again 
550,why make him suffer  when she had tortured him so infernally 
551,why 
552, do you remember the lake   she said  in an abrupt voice  under the pressure of an emotion which caught her heart  made the muscles of her throat stiff  and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said  lake  
553,for she was a child  throwing bread to the ducks  between her parents  and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake  holding her life in her arms which  as she neared them  grew larger and larger in her arms  until it became a whole life  a complete life  which she put down by them and said   this is what i have made of it  this  
554,and what had she made of it 
555,what  indeed 
556,sitting there sewing this morning with peter 
557,she looked at peter walsh  her look  passing through all that time and that emotion  reached him doubtfully  settled on him tearfully  and rose and fluttered away  as a bird touches a branch and rises and flutters away 
558,quite simply she wiped her eyes 
559, yes   said peter 
560, yes  yes  yes   he said  as if she drew up to the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose 
561,stop 
562,stop  he wanted to cry 
563,for he was not old  his life was not over  not by any means 
564,he was only just past fifty 
565,shall i tell her  he thought  or not 
566,he would like to make a clean breast of it all 
567,but she is too cold  he thought  sewing  with her scissors  daisy would look ordinary beside clarissa 
568,and she would think me a failure  which i am in their sense  he thought  in the dalloways  sense 
569,oh yes  he had no doubt about that  he was a failure  compared with all this  the inlaid table  the mounted paper knife  the dolphin and the candlesticks  the chair covers and the old valuable english tinted prints  he was a failure  i detest the smugness of the whole affair  he thought  richard own doing  not clarissa own  save that she married him   here lucy came into the room  carrying silver  more silver  but charming  slender  graceful she looked  he thought  as she stooped to put it down   and this has been going on all the time  he thought  week after week  clarissa own life  while i  he thought  and at once everything seemed to radiate from him  journeys  rides  quarrels  adventures  bridge parties  love affairs  work  work  work  and he took out his knife quite openly  his old horn handled knife which clarissa could swear he had had these thirty years  and clenched his fist upon it 
570,what an extraordinary habit that was  clarissa thought  always playing with a knife 
571,always making one feel  too  frivolous  empty minded  a mere silly chatterbox  as he used 
572,but i too  she thought  and  taking up her needle  summoned  like a queen whose guards have fallen asleep and left her unprotected  she had been quite taken aback by this visit  it had upset her  so that any one can stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles curving over her  summoned to her help the things she did  the things she liked  her husband  elizabeth  her self  in short  which peter hardly knew now  all to come about her and beat off the enemy 
573, well  and what is happened to you   she said 
574,so before a battle begins  the horses paw the ground  toss their heads  the light shines on their flanks  their necks curve 
575,so peter walsh and clarissa  sitting side by side on the blue sofa  challenged each other 
576,his powers chafed and tossed in him 
577,he assembled from different quarters all sorts of things  praise  his career at oxford  his marriage  which she knew nothing whatever about  how he had loved  and altogether done his job 
578, millions of things   he exclaimed  and  urged by the assembly of powers which were now charging this way and that and giving him the feeling at once frightening and extremely exhilarating of being rushed through the air on the shoulders of people he could no longer see  he raised his hands to his forehead 
579,clarissa sat very upright  drew in her breath 
580, i am in love   he said  not to her however  but to some one raised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay your garland down on the grass in the dark 
581, in love   he repeated  now speaking rather dryly to clarissa dalloway   in love with a girl in india  
582,he had deposited his garland 
583,clarissa could make what she would of it 
584, in love   she said 
585,that he at his age should be sucked under in his little bow tie by that monster 
586,and there is no flesh on his neck  his hands are red  and he is six months older than i am  her eye flashed back to her  but in her heart she felt  all the same  he is in love 
587,he has that  she felt  he is in love 
588,but the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts opposed to it  the river which says on  on  on  even though  it admits  there may be no goal for us whatever  still on  on  this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour  made her look very young  very pink  very bright eyed as she sat with her dress upon her knee  and her needle held to the end of green silk  trembling a little 
589,he was in love 
590,not with her 
591,with some younger woman  of course 
592, and who is she   she asked 
593,now this statue must be brought from its height and set down between them 
594, a married woman  unfortunately   he said   the wife of a major in the indian army  
595,and with a curious ironical sweetness he smiled as he placed her in this ridiculous way before clarissa 
596, all the same  he is in love  thought clarissa  
597, she has   he continued  very reasonably   two small children  a boy and a girl  and i have come over to see my lawyers about the divorce  
598,there they are  he thought 
599,do what you like with them  clarissa 
600,there they are 
601,and second by second it seemed to him that the wife of the major in the indian army  his daisy  and her two small children became more and more lovely as clarissa looked at them  as if he had set light to a grey pellet on a plate and there had risen up a lovely tree in the brisk sea salted air of their intimacy  for in some ways no one understood him  felt with him  as clarissa did   their exquisite intimacy 
602,she flattered him  she fooled him  thought clarissa  shaping the woman  the wife of the major in the indian army  with three strokes of a knife 
603,what a waste 
604,what a folly 
605,all his life long peter had been fooled like that  first getting sent down from oxford  next marrying the girl on the boat going out to india  now the wife of a major in the indian army  thank heaven she had refused to marry him 
606,still  he was in love  her old friend  her dear peter  he was in love 
607, but what are you going to do   she asked him 
608,oh the lawyers and solicitors  messrs  hooper and grateley of lincoln own inn  they were going to do it  he said 
609,and he actually pared his nails with his pocket knife 
610,for heaven own sake  leave your knife alone  she cried to herself in irrepressible irritation  it was his silly unconventionality  his weakness  his lack of the ghost of a notion what any one else was feeling that annoyed her  had always annoyed her  and now at his age  how silly 
611,i know all that  peter thought  i know what I am up against  he thought  running his finger along the blade of his knife  clarissa and dalloway and all the rest of them  but I will show clarissa  and then to his utter surprise  suddenly thrown by those uncontrollable forces thrown through the air  he burst into tears  wept  wept without the least shame  sitting on the sofa  the tears running down his cheeks 
612,and clarissa had leant forward  taken his hand  drawn him to her  kissed him   actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing  plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast  which  subsiding  left her holding his hand  patting his knee and  feeling as she sat back extraordinarily at her ease with him and light hearted  all in a clap it came over her  if i had married him  this gaiety would have been mine all day 
613,it was all over for her 
614,the sheet was stretched and the bed narrow 
615,she had gone up into the tower alone and left them blackberrying in the sun 
616,the door had shut  and there among the dust of fallen plaster and the litter of birds  nests how distant the view had looked  and the sounds came thin and chill  once on leith hill  she remembered   and richard  richard  she cried  as a sleeper in the night starts and stretches a hand in the dark for help 
617,lunching with lady bruton  it came back to her 
618,he has left me  i am alone for ever  she thought  folding her hands upon her knee 
619,peter walsh had got up and crossed to the window and stood with his back to her  flicking a bandanna handkerchief from side to side 
620,masterly and dry and desolate he looked  his thin shoulder blades lifting his coat slightly  blowing his nose violently 
621,take me with you  clarissa thought impulsively  as if he were starting directly upon some great voyage  and then  next moment  it was as if the five acts of a play that had been very exciting and moving were now over and she had lived a lifetime in them and had run away  had lived with peter  and it was now over 
622,now it was time to move  and  as a woman gathers her things together  her cloak  her gloves  her opera glasses  and gets up to go out of the theatre into the street  she rose from the sofa and went to peter 
623,and it was awfully strange  he thought  how she still had the power  as she came tinkling  rustling  still had the power as she came across the room  to make the moon  which he detested  rise at bourton on the terrace in the summer sky 
624, tell me   he said  seizing her by the shoulders 
625, are you happy  clarissa  does richard   
626,the door opened 
627, here is my elizabeth   said clarissa  emotionally  histrionically  perhaps 
628, how d y do   said elizabeth coming forward 
629,the sound of big ben striking the half hour struck out between them with extraordinary vigour  as if a young man  strong  indifferent  inconsiderate  were swinging dumb bells this way and that 
630, hullo  elizabeth   cried peter  stuffing his handkerchief into his pocket  going quickly to her  saying  good bye  clarissa  without looking at her  leaving the room quickly  and running downstairs and opening the hall door 
631, peter  peter   cried clarissa  following him out on to the landing 
632, my party to night  remember my party to night   she cried  having to raise her voice against the roar of the open air  and  overwhelmed by the traffic and the sound of all the clocks striking  her voice crying  remember my party to night   sounded frail and thin and very far away as peter walsh shut the door 
633,remember my party  remember my party  said peter walsh as he stepped down the street  speaking to himself rhythmically  in time with the flow of the sound  the direct downright sound of big ben striking the half hour 
634, the leaden circles dissolved in the air  
635,oh these parties  he thought  clarissa own parties 
636,why does she give these parties  he thought 
637,not that he blamed her or this effigy of a man in a tail coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards him 
638,only one person in the world could be as he was  in love 
639,and there he was  this fortunate man  himself  reflected in the plate glass window of a motor car manufacturer in victoria street 
640,all india lay behind him  plains  mountains  epidemics of cholera  a district twice as big as ireland  decisions he had come to alone  he  peter walsh  who was now really for the first time in his life  in love 
641,clarissa had grown hard  he thought  and a trifle sentimental into the bargain  he suspected  looking at the great motor cars capable of doing  how many miles on how many gallons 
642,for he had a turn for mechanics  had invented a plough in his district  had ordered wheel barrows from england  but the coolies would not use them  all of which clarissa knew nothing whatever about 
643,the way she said  here is my elizabeth    that annoyed him 
644,why not  here is elizabeth  simply 
645,it was insincere 
646,and elizabeth did not like it either 
647, still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him  the half hour  still early  only half past eleven still  
648,for he understood young people  he liked them 
649,there was always something cold in clarissa  he thought 
650,she had always  even as a girl  a sort of timidity  which in middle age becomes conventionality  and then it is all up  it is all up  he thought  looking rather drearily into the glassy depths  and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her  overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool  wept  been emotional  told her everything  as usual  as usual 
651,as a cloud crosses the sun  silence falls on london  and falls on the mind 
652,effort ceases 
653,time flaps on the mast 
654,there we stop  there we stand 
655,rigid  the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame 
656,where there is nothing  peter walsh said to himself  feeling hollowed out  utterly empty within 
657,clarissa refused me  he thought 
658,he stood there thinking  clarissa refused me 
659,ah  said st  margaret own  like a hostess who comes into her drawing room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already 
660,i am not late 
661,no  it is precisely half past eleven  she says 
662,yet  though she is perfectly right  her voice  being the voice of the hostess  is reluctant to inflict its individuality 
663,some grief for the past holds it back  some concern for the present 
664,it is half past eleven  she says  and the sound of st  margaret own glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound  like something alive which wants to confide itself  to disperse itself  to be  with a tremor of delight  at rest  like clarissa herself  thought peter walsh  coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white 
665,it is clarissa herself  he thought  with a deep emotion  and an extraordinarily clear  yet puzzling  recollection of her  as if this bell had come into the room years ago  where they sat at some moment of great intimacy  and had gone from one to the other and had left  like a bee with honey  laden with the moment 
666,but what room 
667,what moment 
668,and why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking 
669,then  as the sound of st  margaret own languished  he thought  she has been ill  and the sound expressed languor and suffering 
670,it was her heart  he remembered  and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life  clarissa falling where she stood  in her drawing room 
671,no  he cried 
672,she is not dead 
673,i am not old  he cried  and marched up whitehall  as if there rolled down to him  vigorous  unending  his future 
674,he was not old  or set  or dried in the least 
675,as for caring what they said of him  the dalloways  the whitbreads  and their set  he cared not a straw  not a straw  though it was true he would have  some time or other  to see whether richard could not help him to some job  
676,striding  staring  he glared at the statue of the duke of cambridge 
677,he had been sent down from oxford  true  he had been a socialist  in some sense a failure  true 
678,still the future of civilisation lies  he thought  in the hands of young men like that  of young men such as he was  thirty years ago  with their love of abstract principles  getting books sent out to them all the way from london to a peak in the himalayas  reading science  reading philosophy 
679,the future lies in the hands of young men like that  he thought 
680,a patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind  and with it a rustling  regular thudding sound  which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts  strict in step  up whitehall  without his doing 
681,boys in uniform  carrying guns  marched with their eyes ahead of them  marched  their arms stiff  and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty  gratitude  fidelity  love of england 
682,it is  thought peter walsh  beginning to keep step with them  a very fine training 
683,but they did not look robust 
684,they were weedy for the most part  boys of sixteen  who might  to morrow  stand behind bowls of rice  cakes of soap on counters 
685,now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from finsbury pavement to the empty tomb 
686,they had taken their vow 
687,the traffic respected it  vans were stopped 
688,i cannot keep up with them  peter walsh thought  as they marched up whitehall  and sure enough  on they marched  past him  past every one  in their steady way  as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly  and life  with its varieties  its irreticences  had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline 
689,one had to respect it  one might laugh  but one had to respect it  he thought 
690,there they go  thought peter walsh  pausing at the edge of the pavement  and all the exalted statues  nelson  gordon  havelock  the black  the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them  as if they too had made the same renunciation  peter walsh felt he too had made it  the great renunciation   trampled under the same temptations  and achieved at length a marble stare 
691,but the stare peter walsh did not want for himself in the least  though he could respect it in others 
692,he could respect it in boys 
693,they do not know the troubles of the flesh yet  he thought  as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the strand  all that I have been through  he thought  crossing the road  and standing under gordon own statue  gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped  gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed   poor gordon  he thought 
694,and just because nobody yet knew he was in london  except clarissa  and the earth  after the voyage  still seemed an island to him  the strangeness of standing alone  alive  unknown  at half past eleven in trafalgar square overcame him 
695,what is it 
696,where am i 
697,and why  after all  does one do it 
698,he thought  the divorce seeming all moonshine 
699,and down his mind went flat as a marsh  and three great emotions bowled over him  understanding  a vast philanthropy  and finally  as if the result of the others  an irrepressible  exquisite delight  as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled  shutters moved  and he  having nothing to do with it  yet stood at the opening of endless avenues  down which if he chose he might wander 
700,he had not felt so young for years 
701,he had escaped  was utterly free  as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind  like an unguarded flame  bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding 
702,i have not felt so young for years  thought peter  escaping  only of course for an hour or so  from being precisely what he was  and feeling like a child who runs out of doors  and sees  as he runs  his old nurse waving at the wrong window 
703,but she is extraordinarily attractive  he thought  as  walking across trafalgar square in the direction of the haymarket  came a young woman who  as she passed gordon own statue  seemed  peter walsh thought  susceptible as he was   to she would veil after veil  until she became the very woman he had always had in mind  young  but stately  merry  but discreet  black  but enchanting 
704,straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket knife he started after her to follow this woman  this excitement  which seemed even with its back turned to she would on him a light which connected them  which singled him out  as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name  not peter  but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts 
705, you   she said  only  you   saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders 
706,then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past dent own shop in cockspur street blew out with an enveloping kindness  a mournful tenderness  as of arms that would open and take the tired  
707,but she is not married  she is young  quite young  thought peter  the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across trafalgar square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red 
708,but she waited at the kerbstone 
709,there was a dignity about her 
710,she was not worldly  like clarissa  not rich  like clarissa 
711,was she  he wondered as she moved  respectable 
712,witty  with a lizard own flickering tongue  he thought  for one must invent  must allow oneself a little diversion   a cool waiting wit  a darting wit  not noisy 
713,she moved  she crossed  he followed her 
714,to embarrass her was the last thing he wished 
715,still if she stopped he would say  come and have an ice   he would say  and she would answer  perfectly simply   oh yes  
716,but other people got between them in the street  obstructing him  blotting her out 
717,he pursued  she changed 
718,there was colour in her cheeks  mockery in her eyes  he was an adventurer  reckless  he thought  swift  daring  indeed  landed as he was last night from india  a romantic buccaneer  careless of all these damned proprieties  yellow dressing gowns  pipes  fishing rods  in the shop windows  and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats 
719,he was a buccaneer 
720,on and on she went  across piccadilly  and up regent street  ahead of him  her cloak  her gloves  her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement  as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness 
721,laughing and delightful  she had crossed oxford street and great portland street and turned down one of the little streets  and now  and now  the great moment was approaching  for now she slackened  opened her bag  and with one look in his direction  but not at him  one look that bade farewell  summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly  for ever  had fitted her key  opened the door  and gone 
722,clarissa own voice saying  remember my party  remember my party  sang in his ears 
723,the house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower baskets of vague impropriety 
724,it was over 
725,well  I have had my fun  I have had it  he thought  looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums 
726,and it was smashed to atoms  his fun  for it was half made up  as he knew very well  invented  this escapade with the girl  made up  as one makes up the better part of life  he thought  making oneself up  making her up  creating an exquisite amusement  and something more 
727,but odd it was  and quite true  all this one could never share  it smashed to atoms 
728,he turned  went up the street  thinking to find somewhere to sit  till it was time for lincoln own inn  for messrs  hooper and grateley 
729,where should he go 
730,no matter 
731,up the street  then  towards regent own park 
732,his boots on the pavement struck out  no matter   for it was early  still very early 
733,it was a splendid morning too 
734,like the pulse of a perfect heart  life struck straight through the streets 
735,there was no fumbling  no hesitation 
736,sweeping and swerving  accurately  punctually  noiselessly  there  precisely at the right instant  the motor car stopped at the door 
737,the girl  silk stockinged  feathered  evanescent  but not to him particularly attractive  for he had had his fling   alighted 
738,admirable butlers  tawny chow dogs  halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing  peter saw through the opened door and approved of 
739,a splendid achievement in its own way  after all  london  the season  civilisation 
740,coming as he did from a respectable anglo indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent  it is strange  he thought  what a sentiment i have about that  disliking india  and empire  and army as he did   there were moments when civilisation  even of this sort  seemed dear to him as a personal possession  moments of pride in england  in butlers  chow dogs  girls in their security 
741,ridiculous enough  still there it is  he thought 
742,and the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business  punctual  alert  robust  seemed to him wholly admirable  good fellows  to whom one would entrust one own life  companions in the art of living  who would see one through 
743,what with one thing and another  the show was really very tolerable  and he would sit down in the shade and smoke 
744,there was regent own park 
745,yes 
746,as a child he had walked in regent own park  odd  he thought  how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me  the result of seeing clarissa  perhaps  for women live much more in the past than we do  he thought 
747,they attach themselves to places  and their fathers  a woman own always proud of her father  bourton was a nice place  a very nice place  but i could never get on with the old man  he thought  there was quite a scene one night  an argument about something or other  what  he could not remember 
748,politics presumably 
749,yes  he remembered regent own park  the long straight walk  the little house where one bought air balls to the left  an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other 
750,he looked for an empty seat 
751,he did not want to be bothered  feeling a little drowsy as he did  by people asking him the time 
752,an elderly grey nurse  with a baby asleep in its perambulator  that was the best he could do for himself  sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse 
753,she is a queer looking girl  he thought  suddenly remembering elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother 
754,grown big  quite grown up  not exactly pretty  handsome rather  and she cannot be more than eighteen 
755,probably she does not get on with clarissa 
756, there is my elizabeth   that sort of thing  why not  here is elizabeth  simply   trying to make out  like most mothers  that things are what they are not 
757,she trusts to her charm too much  he thought 
758,she overdoes it 
759,the rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat  he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment  blue  circular  i shall try and get a word alone with elizabeth to night  he thought  then began to wobble into hour glass shapes and taper away  odd shapes they take  he thought 
760,suddenly he closed his eyes  raised his hand with an effort  and threw away the heavy end of his cigar 
761,a great brush swept smooth across his mind  sweeping across it moving branches  children own voices  the shuffle of feet  and people passing  and humming traffic  rising and falling traffic 
762,down  down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep  sank  and was muffled over 
763,the grey nurse resumed her knitting as peter walsh  on the hot seat beside her  began snoring 
764,in her grey dress  moving her hands indefatigably yet quietly  she seemed like the champion of the rights of sleepers  like one of those spectral presences which rise in twilight in woods made of sky and branches 
765,the solitary traveller  haunter of lanes  disturber of ferns  and devastator of great hemlock plants  looking up  suddenly sees the giant figure at the end of the ride 
766,by conviction an atheist perhaps  he is taken by surprise with moments of extraordinary exaltation 
767,nothing exists outside us except a state of mind  he thinks  a desire for solace  for relief  for something outside these miserable pigmies  these feeble  these ugly  these craven men and women 
768,but if he can conceive of her  then in some sort she exists  he thinks  and advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly endows them with womanhood  sees with amazement how grave they become  how majestically  as the breeze stirs them  they dispense with a dark flutter of the leaves charity  comprehension  absolution  and then  flinging themselves suddenly aloft  confound the piety of their aspect with a wild carouse 
769,such are the visions which proffer great cornucopias full of fruit to the solitary traveller  or murmur in his ear like sirens lolloping away on the green sea waves  or are dashed in his face like bunches of roses  or rise to the surface like pale faces which fishermen flounder through floods to embrace 
770,such are the visions which ceaselessly float up  pace beside  put their faces in front of  the actual thing  often overpowering the solitary traveller and taking away from him the sense of the earth  the wish to return  and giving him for substitute a general peace  as if  so he thinks as he advances down the forest ride  all this fever of living were simplicity itself  and myriads of things merged in one thing  and this figure  made of sky and branches as it is  had risen from the troubled sea  he is elderly  past fifty now  as a shape might be sucked up out of the waves to shower down from her magnificent hands compassion  comprehension  absolution 
771,so  he thinks  may i never go back to the lamplight  to the sitting room  never finish my book  never knock out my pipe  never ring for mrs  turner to clear away  rather let me walk straight on to this great figure  who will  with a toss of her head  mount me on her streamers and let me blow to nothingness with the rest 
772,such are the visions 
773,the solitary traveller is soon beyond the wood  and there  coming to the door with shaded eyes  possibly to look for his return  with hands raised  with white apron blowing  is an elderly woman who seems  so powerful is this infirmity  to seek  over a desert  a lost son  to search for a rider destroyed  to be the figure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of the world 
774,so  as the solitary traveller advances down the village street where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden  the evening seems ominous  the figures still  as if some august fate  known to them  awaited without fear  were about to sweep them into complete annihilation 
775,indoors among ordinary things  the cupboard  the table  the window sill with its geraniums  suddenly the outline of the landlady  bending to remove the cloth  becomes soft with light  an adorable emblem which only the recollection of cold human contacts forbids us to embrace 
776,she takes the marmalade  she shuts it in the cupboard 
777, there is nothing more to night  sir  
778,but to whom does the solitary traveller make reply 
779,so the elderly nurse knitted over the sleeping baby in regent own park 
780,so peter walsh snored 
781,he woke with extreme suddenness  saying to himself   the death of the soul  
782, lord  lord   he said to himself out loud  stretching and opening his eyes 
783, the death of the soul  
784,the words attached themselves to some scene  to some room  to some past he had been dreaming of 
785,it became clearer  the scene  the room  the past he had been dreaming of 
786,it was at bourton that summer  early in the  nineties  when he was so passionately in love with clarissa 
787,there were a great many people there  laughing and talking  sitting round a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke 
788,they were talking about a man who had married his housemaid  one of the neighbouring squires  he had forgotten his name 
789,he had married his housemaid  and she had been brought to bourton to call  an awful visit it had been 
790,she was absurdly over dressed   like a cockatoo   clarissa had said  imitating her  and she never stopped talking 
791,on and on she went  on and on 
792,clarissa imitated her 
793,then somebody said  sally seton it was  did it make any real difference to one own feelings to know that before they would married she had had a baby 
794, in those days  in mixed company  it was a bold thing to say  
795,he could see clarissa now  turning bright pink  somehow contracting  and saying   oh  i shall never be able to speak to her again  
796,whereupon the whole party sitting round the tea table seemed to wobble 
797,it was very uncomfortable 
798,he had not blamed her for minding the fact  since in those days a girl brought up as she was  knew nothing  but it was her manner that annoyed him  timid  hard  something arrogant  unimaginative  prudish 
799, the death of the soul  
800,he had said that instinctively  ticketing the moment as he used to do  the death of her soul 
801,every one wobbled  every one seemed to bow  as she spoke  and then to stand up different 
802,he could see sally seton  like a child who has been in mischief  leaning forward  rather flushed  wanting to talk  but afraid  and clarissa did frighten people 
803, she was clarissa own greatest friend  always about the place  totally unlike her  an attractive creature  handsome  dark  with the reputation in those days of great daring and he used to give her cigars  which she smoked in her bedroom  she had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled with her family and old parry disliked them both equally  which was a great bond  
804,then clarissa  still with an air of being offended with them all  got up  made some excuse  and went off  alone 
805,as she opened the door  in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep 
806,she flung herself upon him  went into raptures 
807,it was as if she said to peter  it was all aimed at him  he knew   i know you thought me absurd about that woman just now  but see how extraordinarily sympathetic i am  see how i love my rob  
808,they had always this queer power of communicating without words 
809,she knew directly he criticised her 
810,then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself  like this fuss with the dog  but it never took him in  he always saw through clarissa 
811,not that he said anything  of course  just sat looking glum 
812,it was the way their quarrels often began 
813,she shut the door 
814,at once he became extremely depressed 
815,it all seemed useless  going on being in love  going on quarrelling  going on making it up  and he wandered off alone  among outhouses  stables  looking at the horses 
816, the place was quite a humble one  the parrys were never very well off  but there were always grooms and stable boys about  clarissa loved riding  and an old coachman  what was his name   an old nurse  old moody  old goody  some such name they called her  whom one was taken to visit in a little room with lots of photographs  lots of bird cages  
817,it was an awful evening 
818,he grew more and more gloomy  not about that only  about everything 
819,and he could not see her  could not explain to her  could not have it out 
820,there were always people about  she would go on as if nothing had happened  that was the devilish part of her  this coldness  this woodenness  something very profound in her  which he had felt again this morning talking to her  an impenetrability 
821,yet heaven knows he loved her 
822,she had some queer power of fiddling on one own nerves  turning one own nerves to fiddle strings  yes 
823,he had gone in to dinner rather late  from some idiotic idea of making himself felt  and had sat down by old miss parry  aunt helena  mr 
824,parry own sister  who was supposed to preside 
825,there she sat in her white cashmere shawl  with her head against the window  a formidable old lady  but kind to him  for he had found her some rare flower  and she was a great botanist  marching off in thick boots with a black collecting box slung between her shoulders 
826,he sat down beside her  and could not speak 
827,everything seemed to race past him  he just sat there  eating 
828,and then half way through dinner he made himself look across at clarissa for the first time 
829,she was talking to a young man on her right 
830,he had a sudden revelation 
831, she will marry that man   he said to himself 
832,he did not even know his name 
833,for of course it was that afternoon  that very afternoon  that dalloway had come over  and clarissa called him  wickham   that was the beginning of it all 
834,somebody had brought him over  and clarissa got his name wrong 
835,she introduced him to everybody as wickham 
836,at last he said  my name is dalloway    that was his first view of richard  a fair young man  rather awkward  sitting on a deck chair  and blurting out  my name is dalloway  
837,sally got hold of it  always after that she called him  my name is dalloway  
838,he was a prey to revelations at that time 
839,this one  that she would marry dalloway  was blinding  overwhelming at the moment  there was a sort of  how could he put it   a sort of ease in her manner to him  something maternal  something gentle 
840,they were talking about politics 
841,all through dinner he tried to hear what they were saying 
842,afterwards he could remember standing by old miss parry own chair in the drawing room 
843,clarissa came up  with her perfect manners  like a real hostess  and wanted to introduce him to some one  spoke as if they had never met before  which enraged him  yet even then he admired her for it  he admired her courage  her social instinct  he admired her power of carrying things through   the perfect hostess   he said to her  whereupon she winced all over  but he meant her to feel it  he would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with dalloway  so she left him  and he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him  laughing and talking  behind his back  there he stood by miss parry own chair as though he had been cut out of wood  he talking about wild flowers  never  never had he suffered so infernally  he must have forgotten even to pretend to listen  at last he woke up  he saw miss parry looking rather disturbed  rather indignant  with her prominent eyes fixed  he almost cried out that he could not attend because he was in hell  people began going out of the room  he heard them talking about fetching cloaks  about its being cold on the water  and so on  they were going boating on the lake by moonlight  one of sally own mad ideas 
844,he could hear her describing the moon 
845,and they all went out 
846,he was left quite alone 
847, do not you want to go with them   said aunt helena  old miss parry   she had guessed 
848,and he turned round and there was clarissa again 
849,she had come back to fetch him 
850,he was overcome by her generosity  her goodness 
851, come along   she said 
852, they are waiting  
853,he had never felt so happy in the whole of his life 
854,without a word they made it up 
855,they walked down to the lake 
856,he had twenty minutes of perfect happiness 
857,her voice  her laugh  her dress  something floating  white  crimson   her spirit  her adventurousness  she made them all disembark and explore the island  she startled a hen  she laughed  she sang 
858,and all the time  he knew perfectly well  dalloway was falling in love with her  she was falling in love with dalloway  but it did not seem to matter 
859,nothing mattered 
860,they sat on the ground and talked  he and clarissa 
861,they went in and out of each other own minds without any effort 
862,and then in a second it was over 
863,he said to himself as they were getting into the boat   she will marry that man   dully  without any resentment  but it was an obvious thing 
864,dalloway would marry clarissa 
865,dalloway rowed them in 
866,he said nothing 
867,but somehow as they watched him start  jumping on to his bicycle to ride twenty miles through the woods  wobbling off down the drive  waving his hand and disappearing  he obviously did feel  instinctively  tremendously  strongly  all that  the night  the romance  clarissa 
868,he deserved to have her 
869,for himself  he was absurd 
870,his demands upon clarissa  he could see it now  were absurd 
871,he asked impossible things 
872,he made terrible scenes 
873,she would have accepted him still  perhaps  if he had been less absurd 
874,sally thought so 
875,she wrote him all that summer long letters  how they had talked of him  how she had praised him  how clarissa burst into tears 
876,it was an extraordinary summer  all letters  scenes  telegrams  arriving at bourton early in the morning  hanging about till the servants were up  appalling t te   t tes with old mr  parry at breakfast  aunt helena formidable but kind  sally sweeping him off for talks in the vegetable garden  clarissa in bed with headaches 
877,the final scene  the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life  it might be an exaggeration  but still so it did seem now  happened at three of the clock in the afternoon of a very hot day  it was a trifle that led up to it  sally at lunch saying something about dalloway  and calling him  my name is dalloway   whereupon clarissa suddenly stiffened  coloured  in a way she had  and rapped out sharply   we have had enough of that feeble joke  
878,that was all  but for him it was precisely as if she had said   I am only amusing myself with you  I have an understanding with richard dalloway  
879,so he took it 
880,he had not slept for nights 
881, it is got to be finished one way or the other   he said to himself 
882,he sent a note to her by sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three 
883, something very important has happened   he scribbled at the end of it 
884,the fountain was in the middle of a little shrubbery  far from the house  with shrubs and trees all round it 
885,there she came  even before the time  and they stood with the fountain between them  the spout  it was broken  dribbling water incessantly 
886,how sights fix themselves upon the mind 
887,for example  the vivid green moss 
888,she did not move 
889, tell me the truth  tell me the truth   he kept on saying 
890,he felt as if his forehead would burst 
891,she seemed contracted  petrified 
892,she did not move 
893, tell me the truth   he repeated  when suddenly that old man breitkopf popped his head in carrying the times  stared at them  gaped  and went away 
894,they neither of them moved 
895, tell me the truth   he repeated 
896,he felt that he was grinding against something physically hard  she was unyielding 
897,she was like iron  like flint  rigid up the backbone 
898,and when she said   it is no use  it is no use  this is the end   after he had spoken for hours  it seemed  with the tears running down his cheeks  it was as if she had hit him in the face 
899,she turned  she left him  went away 
900, clarissa   he cried 
901, clarissa  
902,but she never came back 
903,it was over 
904,he went away that night 
905,he never saw her again 
906,it was awful  he cried  awful  awful 
907,still  the sun was hot 
908,still  one got over things 
909,still  life had a way of adding day to day 
910,still  he thought  yawning and beginning to take notice  regent own park had changed very little since he was a boy  except for the squirrels  still  presumably there were compensations  when little elise mitchell  who had been picking up pebbles to add to the pebble collection which she and her brother were making on the nursery mantelpiece  plumped her handful down on the nurse own knee and scudded off again full tilt into a lady own legs 
911,peter walsh laughed out 
912,but lucrezia warren smith was saying to herself  it is wicked  why should i suffer 
913,she was asking  as she walked down the broad path 
914,no  i cannot stand it any longer  she was saying  having left septimus  who was not septimus any longer  to say hard  cruel  wicked things  to talk to himself  to talk to a dead man  on the seat over there  when the child ran full tilt into her  fell flat  and burst out crying 
915,that was comforting rather 
916,she stood her upright  dusted her frock  kissed her 
917,but for herself she had done nothing wrong  she had loved septimus  she had been happy  she had had a beautiful home  and there her sisters lived still  making hats 
918,why should she suffer 
919,the child ran straight back to its nurse  and rezia saw her scolded  comforted  taken up by the nurse who put down her knitting  and the kind looking man gave her his watch to blow open to comfort her  but why should she be exposed 
920,why not left in milan 
921,why tortured 
922,why 
923,slightly waved by tears the broad path  the nurse  the man in grey  the perambulator  rose and fell before her eyes 
924,to be rocked by this malignant torturer was her lot 
925,but why 
926,she was like a bird sheltering under the thin hollow of a leaf  who blinks at the sun when the leaf moves  starts at the crack of a dry twig 
927,she was exposed  she was surrounded by the enormous trees  vast clouds of an indifferent world  exposed  tortured  and why should she suffer 
928,why 
929,she frowned  she stamped her foot 
930,she must go back again to septimus since it was almost time for them to be going to sir william bradshaw 
931,she must go back and tell him  go back to him sitting there on the green chair under the tree  talking to himself  or to that dead man evans  whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop 
932,he had seemed a nice quiet man  a great friend of septimus own  and he had been killed in the war 
933,but such things happen to every one 
934,every one has friends who were killed in the war 
935,every one gives up something when they marry 
936,she had given up her home 
937,she had come to live here  in this awful city 
938,but septimus let himself think about horrible things  as she could too  if she tried 
939,he had grown stranger and stranger 
940,he said people were talking behind the bedroom walls 
941,mrs  filmer thought it odd 
942,he saw things too  he had seen an old woman own head in the middle of a fern  yet he could be happy when he chose  they went to hampton court on top of a bus  and they were perfectly happy  all the little red and yellow flowers were out on the grass  like floating lamps he said  and talked and chattered and laughed  making up stories  suddenly he said   now we will kill ourselves   when they were standing by the river  and he looked at it with a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by  or an omnibus  a look as if something fascinated him  and she felt he was going from her and she caught him by the arm 
943,but going home he was perfectly quiet  perfectly reasonable 
944,he would argue with her about killing themselves  and explain how wicked people were  how he could see them making up lies as they passed in the street 
945,he knew all their thoughts  he said  he knew everything 
946,he knew the meaning of the world  he said 
947,then when they got back he could hardly walk 
948,he lay on the sofa and made her hold his hand to prevent him from falling down  down  he cried  into the flames  and saw faces laughing at him  calling him horrible disgusting names  from the walls  and hands pointing round the screen 
949,yet they were quite alone 
950,but he began to talk aloud  answering people  arguing  laughing  crying  getting very excited and making her write things down 
951,perfect nonsense it was  about death  about miss isabel pole 
952,she could stand it no longer 
953,she would go back 
954,she was close to him now  could see him staring at the sky  muttering  clasping his hands 
955,yet dr  holmes said there was nothing the matter with him 
956,what then had happened  why had he gone  then  why  when she sat by him  did he start  frown at her  move away  and point at her hand  take her hand  look at it terrified 
957,was it that she had taken off her wedding ring 
958, my hand has grown so thin   she said 
959, i have put it in my purse   she told him 
960,he dropped her hand 
961,their marriage was over  he thought  with agony  with relief 
962,the rope was cut  he mounted  he was free  as it was decreed that he  septimus  the lord of men  should be free  alone  since his wife had thrown away her wedding ring  since she had left him   he  septimus  was alone  called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear the truth  to learn the meaning  which now at last  after all the toils of civilisation  greeks  romans  shakespeare  darwin  and now himself  was to be given whole to 
963,       to whom   he asked aloud 
964, to the prime minister   the voices which rustled above his head replied 
965,the supreme secret must be told to the cabinet  first that trees are alive  next there is no crime  next love  universal love  he muttered  gasping  trembling  painfully drawing out these profound truths which needed  so deep were they  so difficult  an immense effort to speak out  but the world was entirely changed by them for ever 
966,no crime  love  he repeated  fumbling for his card and pencil  when a skye terrier snuffed his trousers and he started in an agony of fear 
967,it was turning into a man 
968,he could not watch it happen 
969,it was horrible  terrible to see a dog become a man 
970,at once the dog trotted away 
971,heaven was divinely merciful  infinitely benignant 
972,it spared him  pardoned his weakness 
973,but what was the scientific explanation  for one must be scientific above all things  
974,why could he see through bodies  see into the future  when dogs will become men 
975,it was the heat wave presumably  operating upon a brain made sensitive by eons of evolution 
976,scientifically speaking  the flesh was melted off the world 
977,his body was macerated until only the nerve fibres were left 
978,it was spread like a veil upon a rock 
979,he lay back in his chair  exhausted but upheld 
980,he lay resting  waiting  before he again interpreted  with effort  with agony  to mankind 
981,he lay very high  on the back of the world 
982,the earth thrilled beneath him 
983,red flowers grew through his flesh  their stiff leaves rustled by his head 
984,music began clanging against the rocks up here 
985,it is a motor horn down in the street  he muttered  but up here it cannoned from rock to rock  divided  met in shocks of sound which rose in smooth columns  that music should be visible was a discovery  and became an anthem  an anthem twined round now by a shepherd boy own piping  that is an old man playing a penny whistle by the public house  he muttered  which  as the boy stood still came bubbling from his pipe  and then  as he climbed higher  made its exquisite plaint while the traffic passed beneath 
986,this boy own elegy is played among the traffic  thought septimus 
987,now he withdraws up into the snows  and roses hang about him  the thick red roses which grow on my bedroom wall  he reminded himself 
988,the music stopped 
989,he has his penny  he reasoned it out  and has gone on to the next public house 
990,but he himself remained high on his rock  like a drowned sailor on a rock 
991,i leant over the edge of the boat and fell down  he thought 
992,i went under the sea 
993,i have been dead  and yet am now alive  but let me rest still  he begged  he was talking to himself again  it was awful  awful    and as  before waking  the voices of birds and the sound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony  grow louder and louder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life  so he felt himself drawing towards life  the sun growing hotter  cries sounding louder  something tremendous about to happen 
994,he had only to open his eyes  but a weight was on them  a fear 
995,he strained  he pushed  he looked  he saw regent own park before him 
996,long streamers of sunlight fawned at his feet 
997,the trees waved  brandished 
998,we welcome  the world seemed to say  we accept  we create 
999,beauty  the world seemed to say 
1000,and as if to prove it  scientifically  wherever he looked at the houses  at the railings  at the antelopes stretching over the palings  beauty sprang instantly 
1001,to watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy 
1002,up in the sky swallows swooping  swerving  flinging themselves in and out  round and round  yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them  and the flies rising and falling  and the sun spotting now this leaf  now that  in mockery  dazzling it with soft gold in pure good temper  and now and again some chime  it might be a motor horn  tinkling divinely on the grass stalks  all of this  calm and reasonable as it was  made out of ordinary things as it was  was the truth now  beauty  that was the truth now 
1003,beauty was everywhere 
1004, it is time   said rezia 
1005,the word  time  split its husk  poured its riches over him  and from his lips fell like shells  like shavings from a plane  without his making them  hard  white  imperishable words  and flew to attach themselves to their places in an ode to time  an immortal ode to time 
1006,he sang 
1007,evans answered from behind the tree 
1008,the dead were in thessaly  evans sang  among the orchids 
1009,there they waited till the war was over  and now the dead  now evans himself  
1010, for god own sake do not come  
1011,septimus cried out 
1012,for he could not look upon the dead 
1013,but the branches parted 
1014,a man in grey was actually walking towards them 
1015,it was evans 
1016,but no mud was on him  no wounds  he was not changed 
1017,i must tell the whole world  septimus cried  raising his hand  as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer   raising his hand like some colossal figure who has lamented the fate of man for ages in the desert alone with his hands pressed to his forehead  furrows of despair on his cheeks  and now sees light on the desert own edge which broadens and strikes the iron black figure  and septimus half rose from his chair   and with legions of men prostrate behind him he  the giant mourner  receives for one moment on his face the whole  
1018, but i am so unhappy  septimus   said rezia trying to make him sit down 
1019,the millions lamented  for ages they had sorrowed 
1020,he would turn round  he would tell them in a few moments  only a few moments more  of this relief  of this joy  of this astonishing revelation  
1021, the time  septimus   rezia repeated 
1022, what is the time  
1023,he was talking  he was starting  this man must notice him 
1024,he was looking at them 
1025, i will tell you the time   said septimus  very slowly  very drowsily  smiling mysteriously 
1026,as he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck  the quarter to twelve 
1027,and that is being young  peter walsh thought as he passed them 
1028,to be having an awful scene  the poor girl looked absolutely desperate  in the middle of the morning 
1029,but what was it about  he wondered  what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to her to make her look like that  what awful fix had they got themselves into  both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning 
1030,the amusing thing about coming back to england  after five years  was the way it made  anyhow the first days  things stand out as if one had never seen them before  lovers squabbling under a tree  the domestic family life of the parks 
1031,never had he seen london look so enchanting  the softness of the distances  the richness  the greenness  the civilisation  after india  he thought  strolling across the grass 
1032,this susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt 
1033,still at his age he had  like a boy or a girl even  these alternations of mood  good days  bad days  for no reason whatever  happiness from a pretty face  downright misery at the sight of a frump 
1034,after india of course one fell in love with every woman one met 
1035,there was a freshness about them  even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely  and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming  the long black cloaks  the slimness  the elegance  and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint 
1036,every woman  even the most respectable  had roses blooming under glass  lips cut with a knife  curls of indian ink  there was design  art  everywhere  a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken place 
1037,what did the young people think about 
1038,peter walsh asked himself 
1039,those five years   to   had been  he suspected  somehow very important 
1040,people looked different 
1041,newspapers seemed different 
1042,now for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable weeklies about water closets 
1043,that you could not have done ten years ago  written quite openly about water closets in a respectable weekly 
1044,and then this taking out a stick of rouge  or a powder puff and making up in public 
1045,on board ship coming home there were lots of young men and girls  betty and bertie he remembered in particular  carrying on quite openly  the old mother sitting and watching them with her knitting  cool as a cucumber 
1046,the girl would stand still and powder her nose in front of every one 
1047,and they were not engaged  just having a good time  no feelings hurt on either side 
1048,as hard as nails she was  betty what ownhername    but a thorough good sort 
1049,she would make a very good wife at thirty  she would marry when it suited her to marry  marry some rich man and live in a large house near manchester 
1050,who was it now who had done that 
1051,peter walsh asked himself  turning into the broad walk   married a rich man and lived in a large house near manchester  somebody who had written him a long  gushing letter quite lately about  blue hydrangeas  
1052,it was seeing blue hydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days  sally seton  of course 
1053,it was sally seton  the last person in the world one would have expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near manchester  the wild  the daring  the romantic sally 
1054,but of all that ancient lot  clarissa own friends  whitbreads  kinderleys  cunninghams  kinloch jones own  sally was probably the best  she tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow  she saw through hugh whitbread anyhow  the admirable hugh  when clarissa and the rest were at his feet 
1055, the whitbreads   he could hear her saying 
1056, who are the whitbreads  coal merchants  respectable tradespeople  
1057,hugh she detested for some reason 
1058,he thought of nothing but his own appearance  she said 
1059,he ought to have been a duke 
1060,he would be certain to marry one of the royal princesses 
1061,and of course hugh had the most extraordinary  the most natural  the most sublime respect for the british aristocracy of any human being he had ever come across 
1062,even clarissa had to own that 
1063,oh  but he was such a dear  so unselfish  gave up shooting to please his old mother  remembered his aunts  birthdays  and so on 
1064,sally  to do her justice  saw through all that 
1065,one of the things he remembered best was an argument one sunday morning at bourton about women own rights  that antediluvian topic   when sally suddenly lost her temper  flared up  and told hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in british middle class life 
1066,she told him that she considered him responsible for the state of  those poor girls in piccadilly   hugh  the perfect gentleman  poor hugh   never did a man look more horrified 
1067,she did it on purpose she said afterwards  for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes  
1068, he is read nothing  thought nothing  felt nothing   he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew 
1069,the stable boys had more life in them than hugh  she said 
1070,he was a perfect specimen of the public school type  she said 
1071,no country but england could have produced him 
1072,she was really spiteful  for some reason  had some grudge against him 
1073,something had happened  he forgot what  in the smoking room 
1074,he had insulted her  kissed her 
1075,incredible 
1076,nobody believed a word against hugh of course 
1077,who could 
1078,kissing sally in the smoking room 
1079,if it had been some honourable edith or lady violet  perhaps  but not that ragamuffin sally without a penny to her name  and a father or a mother gambling at monte carlo 
1080,for of all the people he had ever met hugh was the greatest snob  the most obsequious  no  he did not cringe exactly 
1081,he was too much of a prig for that 
1082,a first rate valet was the obvious comparison  somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases  could be trusted to send telegrams  indispensable to hostesses 
1083,and he would found his job  married his honourable evelyn  got some little post at court  looked after the king own cellars  polished the imperial shoe buckles  went about in knee breeches and lace ruffles 
1084,how remorseless life is 
1085,a little job at court 
1086,he had married this lady  the honourable evelyn  and they lived hereabouts  so he thought  looking at the pompous houses overlooking the park   for he had lunched there once in a house which had  like all hugh own possessions  something that no other house could possibly have  linen cupboards it might have been  you had to go and look at them  you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever it was  linen cupboards  pillow cases  old oak furniture  pictures  which hugh had picked up for an old song 
1087,but mrs  hugh sometimes gave the show away 
1088,she was one of those obscure mouse like little women who admire big men 
1089,she was almost negligible 
1090,then suddenly she would say something quite unexpected  something sharp  she had the relics of the grand manner perhaps  the steam coal was a little too strong for her  it made the atmosphere thick 
1091,and so there they lived  with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their pillow cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten thousand a year presumably  while he  who was two years older than hugh  cadged for a job 
1092,at fifty three he had to come and ask them to put him into some secretary own office  to find him some usher own job teaching little boys latin  at the beck and call of some mandarin in an office  something that brought in five hundred a year  for if he married daisy  even with his pension  they could never do on less 
1093,whitbread could do it presumably  or dalloway 
1094,he did not mind what he asked dalloway 
1095,he was a thorough good sort  a bit limited  a bit thick in the head  yes  but a thorough good sort 
1096,whatever he took up he did in the same matter of fact sensible way  without a touch of imagination  without a spark of brilliancy  but with the inexplicable niceness of his type 
1097,he ought to have been a country gentleman  he was wasted on politics  he was at his best out of doors  with horses and dogs  how good he was  for instance  when that great shaggy dog of clarissa own got caught in a trap and had its paw half torn off  and clarissa turned faint and dalloway did the whole thing  bandaged  made splints  told clarissa not to be a fool 
1098,that was what she liked him for perhaps  that was what she needed   now  my dear  do not be a fool  hold this  fetch that   all the time talking to the dog as if it were a human being 
1099,but how could she swallow all that stuff about poetry 
1100,how could she let him hold forth about shakespeare 
1101,seriously and solemnly richard dalloway got on his hind legs and said that no decent man ought to read shakespeare own sonnets because it was like listening at keyholes  besides the relationship was not one that he approved  
1102,no decent man ought to let his wife visit a deceased wife own sister 
1103,incredible 
1104,the only thing to do was to pelt him with sugared almonds  it was at dinner 
1105,but clarissa sucked it all in  thought it so honest of him  so independent of him  heaven knows if she did not think him the most original mind she would ever met 
1106,that was one of the bonds between sally and himself 
1107,there was a garden where they used to walk  a walled in place  with rose bushes and giant cauliflowers  he could remember sally tearing off a rose  stopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the moonlight  it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him  things he had not thought of for years   while she implored him  half laughing of course  to carry off clarissa  to save her from the hughs and the dalloways and all the other  perfect gentlemen  who would  stifle her soul   she wrote reams of poetry in those days   make a mere hostess of her  encourage her worldliness  but one must do clarissa justice  she was not going to marry hugh anyhow  she had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted  her emotions were all on the surface  beneath  she was very shrewd  a far better judge of character than sally  for instance  and with it all  purely feminine  with that extraordinary gift  that woman own gift  of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be 
1108,she came into a room  she stood  as he had often seen her  in a doorway with lots of people round her 
1109,but it was clarissa one remembered 
1110,not that she was striking  not beautiful at all  there was nothing picturesque about her  she never said anything specially clever  there she was  however  there she was 
1111,no  no  no 
1112,he was not in love with her any more 
1113,he only felt  after seeing her that morning  among her scissors and silks  making ready for the party  unable to get away from the thought of her  she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage  which was not being in love  of course  it was thinking of her  criticising her  starting again  after thirty years  trying to explain her 
1114,the obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly  cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world  which was true in a sense  she had admitted it to him 
1115, you could always get her to own up if you took the trouble  she was honest  
1116,what she would say was that she hated frumps  fogies  failures  like himself presumably  thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets  must do something  be something  and these great swells  these duchesses  these hoary old countesses one met in her drawing room  unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw  stood for something real to her 
1117,lady bexborough  she said once  held herself upright  so did clarissa herself  she never lounged in any sense of the word  she was straight as a dart  a little rigid in fact  
1118,she said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected 
1119,in all this there was a great deal of dalloway  of course  a great deal of the public spirited  british empire  tariff reform  governing class spirit  which had grown on her  as it tends to do 
1120,with twice his wits  she had to see things through his eyes  one of the tragedies of married life  with a mind of her own  she must always be quoting richard  as if one could not know to a tittle what richard thought by reading the morning post of a morning 
1121,these parties for example were all for him  or for her idea of him  to do richard justice he would have been happier farming in norfolk  
1122,she made her drawing room a sort of meeting place  she had a genius for it 
1123,over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth  twist him  turn him  wake him up  set him going 
1124,infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course 
1125,but odd unexpected people turned up  an artist sometimes  sometimes a writer  queer fish in that atmosphere 
1126,and behind it all was that network of visiting  leaving cards  being kind to people  running about with bunches of flowers  little presents  so and so was going to france  must have an air cushion  a real drain on her strength  all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up  but she did it genuinely  from a natural instinct 
1127,oddly enough  she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had ever met  and possibly  this was a theory he used to make up to account for her  so transparent in some ways  so inscrutable in others   possibly she said to herself  as we are a doomed race  chained to a sinking ship  her favourite reading as a girl was huxley and tyndall  and they were fond of these nautical metaphors   as the whole thing is a bad joke  let us  at any rate  do our part  mitigate the sufferings of our fellow prisoners  huxley again   decorate the dungeon with flowers and air cushions  be as decent as we possibly can 
1128,those ruffians  the gods  shall not have it all their own way   her notion being that the gods  who never lost a chance of hurting  thwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if  all the same  you behaved like a lady  that phase came directly after sylvia own death  that horrible affair 
1129,to see your own sister killed by a falling tree  all justin parry own fault  all his carelessness  before your very eyes  a girl too on the verge of life  the most gifted of them  clarissa always said  was enough to turn one bitter 
1130,later she was not so positive perhaps  she thought there were no gods  no one was to blame  and so she evolved this atheist own religion of doing good for the sake of goodness 
1131,and of course she enjoyed life immensely 
1132,it was her nature to enjoy  though goodness only knows  she had her reserves  it was a mere sketch  he often felt  that even he  after all these years  could make of clarissa  
1133,anyhow there was no bitterness in her  none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women 
1134,she enjoyed practically everything 
1135,if you walked with her in hyde park now it was a bed of tulips  now a child in a perambulator  now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment 
1136, very likely  she would have talked to those lovers  if she had thought them unhappy  
1137,she had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite  but she needed people  always people  to bring it out  with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away  lunching  dining  giving these incessant parties of hers  talking nonsense  sayings things she did not mean  blunting the edge of her mind  losing her discrimination 
1138,there she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to dalloway  they knew the most appalling bores in europe  or in came elizabeth and everything must give way to her 
1139,she was at a high school  at the inarticulate stage last time he was over  a round eyed  pale faced girl  with nothing of her mother in her  a silent stolid creature  who took it all as a matter of course  let her mother make a fuss of her  and then said  may i go now   like a child of four  going off  clarissa explained  with that mixture of amusement and pride which dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her  to play hockey 
1140,and now elizabeth was  out   presumably  thought him an old fogy  laughed at her mother own friends 
1141,ah well  so be it 
1142,the compensation of growing old  peter walsh thought  coming out of regent own park  and holding his hat in hand  was simply this  that the passions remain as strong as ever  but one has gained  at last   the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence   the power of taking hold of experience  of turning it round  slowly  in the light 
1143,a terrible confession it was  he put his hat on again   but now  at the age of fifty three one scarcely needed people any more 
1144,life itself  every moment of it  every drop of it  here  this instant  now  in the sun  in regent own park  was enough 
1145,too much indeed 
1146,a whole lifetime was too short to bring out  now that one had acquired the power  the full flavour  to extract every ounce of pleasure  every shade of meaning  which both were so much more solid than they used to be  so much less personal 
1147,it was impossible that he should ever suffer again as clarissa had made him suffer 
1148,for hours at a time  pray god that one might say these things without being overheard    for hours and days he never thought of daisy 
1149,could it be that he was in love with her then  remembering the misery  the torture  the extraordinary passion of those days 
1150,it was a different thing altogether  a much pleasanter thing  the truth being  of course  that now she was in love with him 
1151,and that perhaps was the reason why  when the ship actually sailed  he felt an extraordinary relief  wanted nothing so much as to be alone  was annoyed to find all her little attentions  cigars  notes  a rug for the voyage  in his cabin 
1152,every one if they were honest would say the same  one does not want people after fifty  one does not want to go on telling women they are pretty  that is what most men of fifty would say  peter walsh thought  if they were honest 
1153,but then these astonishing accesses of emotion  bursting into tears this morning  what was all that about  what could clarissa have thought of him  thought him a fool presumably  not for the first time  it was jealousy that was at the bottom of it  jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind  peter walsh thought  holding his pocket knife at arm own length 
1154,she had been meeting major orde  daisy said in her last letter  said it on purpose he knew  said it to make him jealous  he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote  wondering what she could say to hurt him  and yet it made no difference  he was furious 
1155,all this pother of coming to england and seeing lawyers was not to marry her  but to prevent her from marrying anybody else 
1156,that was what tortured him  that was what came over him when he saw clarissa so calm  so cold  so intent on her dress or whatever it was  realising what she might have spared him  what she had reduced him to  a whimpering  snivelling old ass 
1157,but women  he thought  shutting his pocket knife  do not know what passion is 
1158,they do not know the meaning of it to men 
1159,clarissa was as cold as an icicle 
1160,there she would sit on the sofa by his side  let him take her hand  give him one kiss  here he was at the crossing 
1161,a sound interrupted him  a frail quivering sound  a voice bubbling up without direction  vigour  beginning or end  running weakly and shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into
1162,ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo  
1163,the voice of no age or sex  the voice of an ancient spring spouting from the earth  which issued  just opposite regent own park tube station from a tall quivering shape  like a funnel  like a rusty pump  like a wind beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which let us the wind run up and down its branches singing
1164,ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo
1165,and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze 
1166,through all ages  when the pavement was grass  when it was swamp  through the age of tusk and mammoth  through the age of silent sunrise  the battered woman  for she wore a skirt  with her right hand exposed  her left clutching at her side  stood singing of love  love which has lasted a million years  she sang  love which prevails  and millions of years ago  her lover  who had been dead these centuries  had walked  she crooned  with her in may  but in the course of ages  long as summer days  and flaming  she remembered  with nothing but red asters  he had gone  death own enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills  and when at last she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth  now become a mere cinder of ice  she implored the gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple heather  there on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun caressed  for then the pageant of the universe would be over 
1167,as the ancient song bubbled up opposite regent own park tube station still the earth seemed green and flowery  still  though it issued from so rude a mouth  a mere hole in the earth  muddy too  matted with root fibres and tangled grasses  still the old bubbling burbling song  soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages  and skeletons and treasure  streamed away in rivulets over the pavement and all along the marylebone road  and down towards euston  fertilising  leaving a damp stain 
1168,still remembering how once in some primeval may she had walked with her lover  this rusty pump  this battered old woman with one hand exposed for coppers the other clutching her side  would still be there in ten million years  remembering how once she had walked in may  where the sea flows now  with whom it did not matter  he was a man  oh yes  a man who had loved her 
1169,but the passage of ages had blurred the clarity of that ancient may day  the bright petalled flowers were hoar and silver frosted  and she no longer saw  when she implored him  as she did now quite clearly   look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently   she no longer saw brown eyes  black whiskers or sunburnt face but only a looming shape  a shadow shape  to which  with the bird like freshness of the very aged she still twittered  give me your hand and let me press it gently   peter walsh could not help giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi    and if some one should see  what matter they   she demanded  and her fist clutched at her side  and she smiled  pocketing her shilling  and all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out  and the passing generations  the pavement was crowded with bustling middle class people  vanished  like leaves  to be trodden under  to be soaked and steeped and made mould of by that eternal spring  
1170,ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo
1171, poor old woman   said rezia warren smith  waiting to cross 
1172,oh poor old wretch 
1173,suppose it was a wet night 
1174,suppose one own father  or somebody who had known one in better days had happened to pass  and saw one standing there in the gutter 
1175,and where did she sleep at night 
1176,cheerfully  almost gaily  the invincible thread of sound wound up into the air like the smoke from a cottage chimney  winding up clean beech trees and issuing in a tuft of blue smoke among the topmost leaves 
1177, and if some one should see  what matter they  
1178,since she was so unhappy  for weeks and weeks now  rezia had given meanings to things that happened  almost felt sometimes that she must stop people in the street  if they looked good  kind people  just to say to them  i am unhappy   and this old woman singing in the street  if some one should see  what matter they   made her suddenly quite sure that everything was going to be right 
1179,they were going to sir william bradshaw  she thought his name sounded nice  he would cure septimus at once 
1180,and then there was a brewer own cart  and the grey horses had upright bristles of straw in their tails  there were newspaper placards 
1181,it was a silly  silly dream  being unhappy 
1182,so they crossed  mr  and mrs  septimus warren smith  and was there  after all  anything to draw attention to them  anything to make a passer by suspect here is a young man who carries in him the greatest message in the world  and is  moreover  the happiest man in the world  and the most miserable 
1183,perhaps they walked more slowly than other people  and there was something hesitating  trailing  in the man own walk  but what more natural for a clerk  who has not been in the west end on a weekday at this hour for years  than to keep looking at the sky  looking at this  that and the other  as if portland place were a room he had come into when the family are away  the chandeliers being hung in holland bags  and the caretaker  as she let us in long shafts of dusty light upon deserted  queer looking armchairs  lifting one corner of the long blinds  explains to the visitors what a wonderful place it is  how wonderful  but at the same time  he thinks  as he looks at chairs and tables  how strange 
1184,to look at  he might have been a clerk  but of the better sort  for he wore brown boots  his hands were educated  so  too  his profile  his angular  big nosed  intelligent  sensitive profile  but not his lips altogether  for they were loose  and his eyes  as eyes tend to be   eyes merely  hazel  large  so that he was  on the whole  a border case  neither one thing nor the other  might end with a house at purley and a motor car  or continue renting apartments in back streets all his life  one of those half educated  self educated men whose education is all learnt from books borrowed from public libraries  read in the evening after the day own work  on the advice of well known authors consulted by letter 
1185,as for the other experiences  the solitary ones  which people go through alone  in their bedrooms  in their offices  walking the fields and the streets of london  he had them  had left home  a mere boy  because of his mother  she lied  because he came down to tea for the fiftieth time with his hands unwashed  because he could see no future for a poet in stroud  and so  making a confidant of his little sister  had gone to london leaving an absurd note behind him  such as great men have written  and the world has read later when the story of their struggles has become famous 
1186,london has swallowed up many millions of young men called smith  thought nothing of fantastic christian names like septimus with which their parents have thought to distinguish them 
1187,lodging off the euston road  there were experiences  again experiences  such as change a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean  contracted  hostile 
1188,but of all this what could the most observant of friends have said except what a gardener says when he opens the conservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his plant   it has flowered  flowered from vanity  ambition  idealism  passion  loneliness  courage  laziness  the usual seeds  which all muddled up  in a room off the euston road   made him shy  and stammering  made him anxious to improve himself  made him fall in love with miss isabel pole  lecturing in the waterloo road upon shakespeare 
1189,was he not like keats 
1190,she asked  and reflected how she might give him a taste of antony and cleopatra and the rest  lent him books  wrote him scraps of letters  and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime  without heat  flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over miss pole  antony and cleopatra  and the waterloo road 
1191,he thought her beautiful  believed her impeccably wise  dreamed of her  wrote poems to her  which  ignoring the subject  she corrected in red ink  he saw her  one summer evening  walking in a green dress in a square 
1192, it has flowered   the gardener might have said  had he opened the door  had he come in  that is to say  any night about this time  and found him writing  found him tearing up his writing  found him finishing a masterpiece at three of the clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets  and visiting churches  and fasting one day  drinking another  devouring shakespeare  darwin  the history of civilisation  and bernard shaw 
1193,something was up  mr  brewer knew  mr  brewer  managing clerk at sibleys and arrowsmiths  auctioneers  valuers  land and estate agents  something was up  he thought  and  being paternal with his young men  and thinking very highly of smith own abilities  and prophesying that he would  in ten or fifteen years  succeed to the leather arm chair in the inner room under the skylight with the deed boxes round him   if he keeps his health   said mr  brewer  and that was the danger  he looked weakly  advised football  invited him to supper and was seeing his way to consider recommending a rise of salary  when something happened which threw out many of mr  brewer own calculations  took away his ablest young fellows  and eventually  so prying and insidious were the fingers of the european war  smashed a plaster cast of ceres  ploughed a hole in the geranium beds  and utterly ruined the cook own nerves at mr  brewer own establishment at muswell hill 
1194,septimus was one of the first to volunteer 
1195,he went to france to save an england which consisted almost entirely of shakespeare own plays and miss isabel pole in a green dress walking in a square 
1196,there in the trenches the change which mr  brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly  he developed manliness  he was promoted  he drew the attention  indeed the affection of his officer  evans by name 
1197,it was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth rug  one worrying a paper screw  snarling  snapping  giving a pinch  now and then  at the old dog own ear  the other lying somnolent  blinking at the fire  raising a paw  turning and growling good temperedly 
1198,they had to be together  share with each other  fight with each other  quarrel with each other 
1199,but when evans  rezia who had only seen him once called him  a quiet man   a sturdy red haired man  undemonstrative in the company of women   when evans was killed  just before the armistice  in italy  septimus  far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship  congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably 
1200,the war had taught him 
1201,it was sublime 
1202,he had gone through the whole show  friendship  european war  death  had won promotion  was still under thirty and was bound to survive 
1203,he was right there 
1204,the last shells missed him 
1205,he watched them explode with indifference 
1206,when peace came he was in milan  billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard  flowers in tubs  little tables in the open  daughters making hats  and to lucrezia  the younger daughter  he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him  that he could not feel 
1207,for now that it was all over  truce signed  and the dead buried  he had  especially in the evening  these sudden thunder claps of fear 
1208,he could not feel 
1209,as he opened the door of the room where the italian girls sat making hats  he could see them  could hear them  they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers  they were turning buckram shapes this way and that  the table was all strewn with feathers  spangles  silks  ribbons  scissors were rapping on the table  but something failed him  he could not feel 
1210,still  scissors rapping  girls laughing  hats being made protected him  he was assured of safety  he had a refuge 
1211,but he could not sit there all night 
1212,there were moments of waking in the early morning 
1213,the bed was falling  he was falling 
1214,oh for the scissors and the lamplight and the buckram shapes 
1215,he asked lucrezia to marry him  the younger of the two  the gay  the frivolous  with those little artist own fingers that she would hold up and say  it is all in them  
1216,silk  feathers  what not were alive to them 
1217, it is the hat that matters most   she would say  when they walked out together 
1218,every hat that passed  she would examine  and the cloak and the dress and the way the woman held herself 
1219,ill dressing  over dressing she stigmatised  not savagely  rather with impatient movements of the hands  like those of a painter who puts from him some obvious well meant glaring imposture  and then  generously  but always critically  she would welcome a shopgirl who had turned her little bit of stuff gallantly  or praise  wholly  with enthusiastic and professional understanding  a french lady descending from her carriage  in chinchilla  robes  pearls 
1220, beautiful   she would murmur  nudging septimus  that he might see 
1221,but beauty was behind a pane of glass 
1222,even taste  rezia liked ices  chocolates  sweet things  had no relish to him 
1223,he put down his cup on the little marble table 
1224,he looked at people outside  happy they seemed  collecting in the middle of the street  shouting  laughing  squabbling over nothing 
1225,but he could not taste  he could not feel 
1226,in the tea shop among the tables and the chattering waiters the appalling fear came over him  he could not feel  he could reason  he could read  dante for example  quite easily   septimus  do put down your book   said rezia  gently shutting the inferno   he could add up his bill  his brain was perfect  it must be the fault of the world then  that he could not feel 
1227, the english are so silent   rezia said 
1228,she liked it  she said 
1229,she respected these englishmen  and wanted to see london  and the english horses  and the tailor made suits  and could remember hearing how wonderful the shops were  from an aunt who had married and lived in soho 
1230,it might be possible  septimus thought  looking at england from the train window  as they left newhaven  it might be possible that the world itself is without meaning 
1231,at the office they advanced him to a post of considerable responsibility 
1232,they were proud of him  he had won crosses 
1233, you have done your duty  it is up to us    began mr  brewer  and could not finish  so pleasurable was his emotion 
1234,they took admirable lodgings off the tottenham court road 
1235,here he opened shakespeare once more 
1236,that boy own business of the intoxication of language  antony and cleopatra  had shrivelled utterly 
1237,how shakespeare loathed humanity  the putting on of clothes  the getting of children  the sordidity of the mouth and the belly 
1238,this was now revealed to septimus  the message hidden in the beauty of words 
1239,the secret signal which one generation passes  under disguise  to the next is loathing  hatred  despair 
1240,dante the same 
1241,aeschylus  translated  the same 
1242,there rezia sat at the table trimming hats 
1243,she trimmed hats for mrs  filmer own friends  she trimmed hats by the hour 
1244,she looked pale  mysterious  like a lily  drowned  under water  he thought 
1245, the english are so serious   she would say  putting her arms round septimus  her cheek against his 
1246,love between man and woman was repulsive to shakespeare 
1247,the business of copulation was filth to him before the end 
1248,but  rezia said  she must have children 
1249,they had been married five years 
1250,they went to the tower together  to the victoria and albert museum  stood in the crowd to see the king open parliament 
1251,and there were the shops  hat shops  dress shops  shops with leather bags in the window  where she would stand staring 
1252,but she must have a boy 
1253,she must have a son like septimus  she said 
1254,but nobody could be like septimus  so gentle  so serious  so clever 
1255,could she not read shakespeare too 
1256,was shakespeare a difficult author 
1257,she asked 
1258,one cannot bring children into a world like this 
1259,one cannot perpetuate suffering  or increase the breed of these lustful animals  who have no lasting emotions  but only whims and vanities  eddying them now this way  now that 
1260,he watched her snip  shape  as one watches a bird hop  flit in the grass  without daring to move a finger 
1261,for the truth is  let her ignore it  that human beings have neither kindness  nor faith  nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment 
1262,they hunt in packs 
1263,their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the wilderness 
1264,they desert the fallen 
1265,they are plastered over with grimaces 
1266,there was brewer at the office  with his waxed moustache  coral tie pin  white slip  and pleasurable emotions  all coldness and clamminess within   his geraniums ruined in the war  his cook own nerves destroyed  or amelia what ownhername  handing round cups of tea punctually at five  a leering  sneering obscene little harpy  and the toms and berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick drops of vice 
1267,they never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at their antics in his notebook 
1268,in the street  vans roared past him  brutality blared out on placards  men were trapped in mines  women burnt alive  and once a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or displayed for the diversion of the populace  who laughed aloud   ambled and nodded and grinned past him  in the tottenham court road  each half apologetically  yet triumphantly  inflicting his hopeless woe 
1269,and would he go mad 
1270,at tea rezia told him that mrs  filmer own daughter was expecting a baby 
1271,she could not grow old and have no children 
1272,she was very lonely  she was very unhappy 
1273,she cried for the first time since they were married 
1274,far away he heard her sobbing  he heard it accurately  he noticed it distinctly  he compared it to a piston thumping 
1275,but he felt nothing 
1276,his wife was crying  and he felt nothing  only each time she sobbed in this profound  this silent  this hopeless way  he descended another step into the pit 
1277,at last  with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically and with complete consciousness of its insincerity  he dropped his head on his hands 
1278,now he had surrendered  now other people must help him 
1279,people must be sent for 
1280,he gave in 
1281,nothing could rouse him 
1282,rezia put him to bed 
1283,she sent for a doctor  mrs  filmer own dr  holmes  dr  holmes examined him  there was nothing whatever the matter  said dr  holmes  oh  what a relief  what a kind man  what a good man  thought rezia  when he felt like that he went to the music hall  said dr  holmes  he took a day off with his wife and played golf  why not try two tabloids of bromide dissolved in a glass of water at bedtime  these old bloomsbury houses  said dr  holmes  tapping the wall  are often full of very fine panelling  which the landlords have the folly to paper over  only the other day  visiting a patient  sir somebody something in bedford square  
1284,so there was no excuse  nothing whatever the matter  except the sin for which human nature had condemned him to death  that he did not feel 
1285,he had not cared when evans was killed  that was worst  but all the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and jeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the morning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation  how he had married his wife without loving her  had lied to her  seduced her  outraged miss isabel pole  and was so pocked and marked with vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street 
1286,the verdict of human nature on such a wretch was death 
1287,dr  holmes came again 
1288,large  fresh coloured  handsome  flicking his boots  looking in the glass  he brushed it all aside  headaches  sleeplessness  fears  dreams  nerve symptoms and nothing more  he said 
1289,if dr  holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six  he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast 
1290, rezia would learn to cook porridge  
1291,but  he continued  health is largely a matter in our own control 
1292,throw yourself into outside interests  take up some hobby 
1293,he opened shakespeare  antony and cleopatra  pushed shakespeare aside 
1294,some hobby  said dr  holmes  for did he not owe his own excellent health  and he worked as hard as any man in london  to the fact that he could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture 
1295,and what a very pretty comb  if he might say so  mrs  warren smith was wearing 
1296,when the damned fool came again  septimus refused to see him 
1297,did he indeed 
1298,said dr  holmes  smiling agreeably 
1299,really he had to give that charming little lady  mrs  smith  a friendly push before he could get past her into her husband own bedroom 
1300, so you are in a funk   he said agreeably  sitting down by his patient own side 
1301,he had actually talked of killing himself to his wife  quite a girl  a foreigner  was not she 
1302,did not that give her a very odd idea of english husbands 
1303,did not one owe perhaps a duty to one own wife 
1304,would not it be better to do something instead of lying in bed 
1305,for he had had forty years  experience behind him  and septimus could take dr  holmes own word for it  there was nothing whatever the matter with him 
1306,and next time dr  holmes came he hoped to find smith out of bed and not making that charming little lady his wife anxious about him 
1307,human nature  in short  was on him  the repulsive brute  with the blood red nostrils 
1308,holmes was on him 
1309,dr  holmes came quite regularly every day 
1310,once you stumble  septimus wrote on the back of a postcard  human nature is on you 
1311,holmes is on you 
1312,their only chance was to escape  without letting holmes know  to italy  anywhere  anywhere  away from dr  holmes 
1313,but rezia could not understand him 
1314,dr  holmes was such a kind man 
1315,he was so interested in septimus 
1316,he only wanted to help them  he said 
1317,he had four little children and he had asked her to tea  she told septimus 
1318,so he was deserted 
1319,the whole world was clamouring  kill yourself  kill yourself  for our sakes 
1320,but why should he kill himself for their sakes 
1321,food was pleasant  the sun hot  and this killing oneself  how does one set about it  with a table knife  uglily  with floods of blood   by sucking a gaspipe 
1322,he was too weak  he could scarcely raise his hand 
1323,besides  now that he was quite alone  condemned  deserted  as those who are about to die are alone  there was a luxury in it  an isolation full of sublimity  a freedom which the attached can never know 
1324,holmes had won of course  the brute with the red nostrils had won 
1325,but even holmes himself could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world  this outcast  who gazed back at the inhabited regions  who lay  like a drowned sailor  on the shore of the world 
1326,it was at that moment  rezia gone shopping  that the great revelation took place 
1327,a voice spoke from behind the screen 
1328,evans was speaking 
1329,the dead were with him 
1330, evans  evans   he cried 
1331,mr  smith was talking aloud to himself  agnes the servant girl cried to mrs  filmer in the kitchen 
1332, evans  evans   he had said as she brought in the tray 
1333,she jumped  she did 
1334,she scuttled downstairs 
1335,and rezia came in  with her flowers  and walked across the room  and put the roses in a vase  upon which the sun struck directly  and it went laughing  leaping round the room 
1336,she had had to buy the roses  rezia said  from a poor man in the street 
1337,but they were almost dead already  she said  arranging the roses 
1338,so there was a man outside  evans presumably  and the roses  which rezia said were half dead  had been picked by him in the fields of greece 
1339, communication is health  communication is happiness  communication    he muttered 
1340, what are you saying  septimus  
1341,rezia asked  wild with terror  for he was talking to himself 
1342,she sent agnes running for dr  holmes 
1343,her husband  she said  was mad 
1344,he scarcely knew her 
1345, you brute  you brute   cried septimus  seeing human nature  that is dr  holmes  enter the room 
1346, now what is all this about   said dr  holmes in the most amiable way in the world 
1347, talking nonsense to frighten your wife  
1348,but he would give him something to make him sleep 
1349,and if they were rich people  said dr  holmes  looking ironically round the room  by all means let them go to harley street  if they had no confidence in him  said dr  holmes  looking not quite so kind 
1350,it was precisely twelve of the clock  twelve by big ben  whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of london  blent with that of other clocks  mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke  and died up there among the seagulls  twelve of the clock struck as clarissa dalloway laid her green dress on her bed  and the warren smiths walked down harley street 
1351,twelve was the hour of their appointment 
1352,probably  rezia thought  that was sir william bradshaw own house with the grey motor car in front of it 
1353,the leaden circles dissolved in the air 
1354,indeed it was  sir william bradshaw own motor car  low  powerful  grey with plain initials  interlocked on the panel  as if the pomps of heraldry were incongruous  this man being the ghostly helper  the priest of science  and  as the motor car was grey  so to match its sober suavity  grey furs  silver grey rugs were heaped in it  to keep her ladyship warm while she waited 
1355,for often sir william would travel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich  the afflicted  who could afford the very large fee which sir william very properly charged for his advice 
1356,her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more  leaning back  thinking sometimes of the patient  sometimes  excusably  of the wall of gold  mounting minute by minute while she waited  the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties  she had borne them bravely  they had had their struggles  until she felt wedged on a calm ocean  where only spice winds blow  respected  admired  envied  with scarcely anything left to wish for  though she regretted her stoutness  large dinner parties every thursday night to the profession  an occasional bazaar to be opened  royalty greeted  too little time  alas  with her husband  whose work grew and grew  a boy doing well at eton  she would have liked a daughter too  interests she had  however  in plenty  child welfare  the after care of the epileptic  and photography  so that if there was a church building  or a church decaying  she bribed the sexton  got the key and took photographs  which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals  while she waited 
1357,sir william himself was no longer young 
1358,he had worked very hard  he had won his position by sheer ability  being the son of a shopkeeper   loved his profession  made a fine figurehead at ceremonies and spoke well  all of which had by the time he was knighted given him a heavy look  a weary look  the stream of patients being so incessant  the responsibilities and privileges of his profession so onerous   which weariness  together with his grey hairs  increased the extraordinary distinction of his presence and gave him the reputation  of the utmost importance in dealing with nerve cases  not merely of lightning skill  and almost infallible accuracy in diagnosis but of sympathy  tact  understanding of the human soul  he could see the first moment they came into the room  the warren smiths they were called   he was certain directly he saw the man  it was a case of extreme gravity  it was a case of complete breakdown  complete physical and nervous breakdown  with every symptom in an advanced stage  he ascertained in two or three minutes  writing answers to questions  murmured discreetly  on a pink card  
1359,how long had dr  holmes been attending him 
1360,six weeks 
1361,prescribed a little bromide 
1362,said there was nothing the matter 
1363,ah yes  those general practitioners  thought sir william  it took half his time to undo their blunders  some were irreparable  
1364, you served with great distinction in the war  
1365,the patient repeated the word  war  interrogatively 
1366,he was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind 
1367,a serious symptom  to be noted on the card 
1368, the war   the patient asked 
1369,the european war  that little shindy of schoolboys with gunpowder 
1370,had he served with distinction 
1371,he really forgot 
1372,in the war itself he had failed 
1373, yes  he served with the greatest distinction   rezia assured the doctor   he was promoted  
1374, and they have the very highest opinion of you at your office  
1375,sir william murmured  glancing at mr  brewer own very generously worded letter 
1376, so that you have nothing to worry you  no financial anxiety  nothing  
1377,he had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by human nature 
1378, i have  i have   he began   committed a crime   
1379, he has done nothing wrong whatever   rezia assured the doctor 
1380,if mr  smith would wait  said sir william  he would speak to mrs  smith in the next room 
1381,her husband was very seriously ill  sir william said 
1382,did he threaten to kill himself 
1383,oh  he did  she cried 
1384,but he did not mean it  she said 
1385,of course not 
1386,it was merely a question of rest  said sir william  of rest  rest  rest  a long rest in bed 
1387,there was a delightful home down in the country where her husband would be perfectly looked after 
1388,away from her 
1389,she asked 
1390,unfortunately  yes  the people we care for most are not good for us when we are ill 
1391,but he was not mad  was he 
1392,sir william said he never spoke of  madness   he called it not having a sense of proportion 
1393,but her husband did not like doctors 
1394,he would refuse to go there 
1395,shortly and kindly sir william explained to her the state of the case 
1396,he had threatened to kill himself 
1397,there was no alternative 
1398,it was a question of law 
1399,he would lie in bed in a beautiful house in the country 
1400,the nurses were admirable 
1401,sir william would visit him once a week 
1402,if mrs  warren smith was quite sure she had no more questions to ask  he never hurried his patients  they would return to her husband 
1403,she had nothing more to ask  not of sir william 
1404,so they returned to the most exalted of mankind  the criminal who faced his judges  the victim exposed on the heights  the fugitive  the drowned sailor  the poet of the immortal ode  the lord who had gone from life to death  to septimus warren smith  who sat in the arm chair under the skylight staring at a photograph of lady bradshaw in court dress  muttering messages about beauty 
1405, we have had our little talk   said sir william 
1406, he says you are very  very ill   rezia cried 
1407, we have been arranging that you should go into a home   said sir william 
1408, one of holmes own homes   sneered septimus 
1409,the fellow made a distasteful impression 
1410,for there was in sir william  whose father had been a tradesman  a natural respect for breeding and clothing  which shabbiness nettled  again  more profoundly  there was in sir william  who had never had time for reading  a grudge  deeply buried  against cultivated people who came into his room and intimated that doctors  whose profession is a constant strain upon all the highest faculties  are not educated men 
1411, one of my homes  mr  warren smith   he said   where we will teach you to rest  
1412,and there was just one thing more 
1413,he was quite certain that when mr  warren smith was well he was the last man in the world to frighten his wife 
1414,but he had talked of killing himself 
1415, we all have our moments of depression   said sir william 
1416,once you fall  septimus repeated to himself  human nature is on you 
1417,holmes and bradshaw are on you 
1418,they scour the desert 
1419,they fly screaming into the wilderness 
1420,the rack and the thumbscrew are applied 
1421,human nature is remorseless 
1422, impulses came upon him sometimes  
1423,sir william asked  with his pencil on a pink card 
1424,that was his own affair  said septimus 
1425, nobody lives for himself alone   said sir william  glancing at the photograph of his wife in court dress 
1426, and you have a brilliant career before you   said sir william 
1427,there was mr  brewer own letter on the table 
1428, an exceptionally brilliant career  
1429,but if he confessed 
1430,if he communicated 
1431,would they let him off then  his torturers 
1432, i  i    he stammered 
1433,but what was his crime 
1434,he could not remember it 
1435, yes  
1436,sir william encouraged him 
1437, but it was growing late  
1438,love  trees  there is no crime  what was his message 
1439,he could not remember it 
1440,septimus stammered 
1441, try to think as little about yourself as possible   said sir william kindly 
1442,really  he was not fit to be about 
1443,was there anything else they wished to ask him 
1444,sir william would make all arrangements  he murmured to rezia  and he would let her know between five and six that evening he murmured 
1445, trust everything to me   he said  and dismissed them 
1446,never  never had rezia felt such agony in her life 
1447,she had asked for help and been deserted 
1448,he had failed them 
1449,sir william bradshaw was not a nice man 
1450,the upkeep of that motor car alone must cost him quite a lot  said septimus  when they got out into the street 
1451,she clung to his arm 
1452,they had been deserted 
1453,but what more did she want 
1454,to his patients he gave three quarters of an hour  and if in this exacting science which has to do with what  after all  we know nothing about  the nervous system  the human brain  a doctor loses his sense of proportion  as a doctor he fails 
1455,health we must have  and health is proportion  so that when a man comes into your room and says he is christ  a common delusion   and has a message  as they mostly have  and threatens  as they often do  to kill himself  you invoke proportion  order rest in bed  rest in solitude  silence and rest  rest without friends  without books  without messages  six months  rest  until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve 
1456,proportion  divine proportion  sir william own goddess  was acquired by sir william walking hospitals  catching salmon  begetting one son in harley street by lady bradshaw  who caught salmon herself and took photographs scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals 
1457,worshipping proportion  sir william not only prospered himself but made england prosper  secluded her lunatics  forbade childbirth  penalised despair  made it impossible for the unfit to propagate their views until they  too  shared his sense of proportion  his  if they were men  lady bradshaw own if they were women  she embroidered  knitted  spent four nights out of seven at home with her son   so that not only did his colleagues respect him  his subordinates fear him  but the friends and relations of his patients felt for him the keenest gratitude for insisting that these prophetic christs and christesses  who prophesied the end of the world  or the advent of god  should drink milk in bed  as sir william ordered  sir william with his thirty years  experience of these kinds of cases  and his infallible instinct  this is madness  this sense  in fact  his sense of proportion 
1458,but proportion has a sister  less smiling  more formidable  a goddess even now engaged  in the heat and sands of india  the mud and swamp of africa  the purlieus of london  wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own  is even now engaged in dashing down shrines  smashing idols  and setting up in their place her own stern countenance 
1459,conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly  loving to impress  to impose  adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace 
1460,at hyde park corner on a tub she stands preaching  shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments  offers help  but desires power  smites out of her way roughly the dissentient  or dissatisfied  bestows her blessing on those who  looking upward  catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own 
1461,this lady too  rezia warren smith divined it  had her dwelling in sir william own heart  though concealed  as she mostly is  under some plausible disguise  some venerable name  love  duty  self sacrifice 
1462,how he would work  how toil to raise funds  propagate reforms  initiate institutions 
1463,but conversion  fastidious goddess  loves blood better than brick  and feasts most subtly on the human will 
1464,for example  lady bradshaw 
1465,fifteen years ago she had gone under 
1466,it was nothing you could put your finger on  there had been no scene  no snap  only the slow sinking  water logged  of her will into his 
1467,sweet was her smile  swift her submission  dinner in harley street  numbering eight or nine courses  feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes  was smooth and urbane 
1468,only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness  or uneasiness perhaps  a nervous twitch  fumble  stumble and confusion indicated  what it was really painful to believe  that the poor lady lied 
1469,once  long ago  she had caught salmon freely  now  quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband own eye so oilily for dominion  for power  she cramped  squeezed  pared  pruned  drew back  peeped through  so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable  and caused this pressure on the top of the head  which might well be imputed to the professional conversation  or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life  lady bradshaw said   is not his own but his patients    disagreeable it was  so that guests  when the clock struck ten  breathed in the air of harley street even with rapture  which relief  however  was denied to his patients 
1470,there in the grey room  with the pictures on the wall  and the valuable furniture  under the ground glass skylight  they learnt the extent of their transgressions  huddled up in arm chairs  they watched him go through  for their benefit  a curious exercise with the arms  which he shot out  brought sharply back to his hip  to prove  if the patient was obstinate  that sir william was master of his own actions  which the patient was not 
1471,there some weakly broke down  sobbed  submitted  others  inspired by heaven knows what intemperate madness  called sir william to his face a damnable humbug  questioned  even more impiously  life itself 
1472,why live 
1473,they demanded 
1474,sir william replied that life was good 
1475,certainly lady bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece  and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year 
1476,but to us  they protested  life has given no such bounty 
1477,he acquiesced 
1478,they lacked a sense of proportion 
1479,and perhaps  after all  there is no god 
1480,he shrugged his shoulders 
1481,in short  this living or not living is an affair of our own 
1482,but there they were mistaken 
1483,sir william had a friend in surrey where they taught  what sir william frankly admitted was a difficult art  a sense of proportion 
1484,there were  moreover  family affection  honour  courage  and a brilliant career 
1485,all of these had in sir william a resolute champion 
1486,if they failed him  he had to support police and the good of society  which  he remarked very quietly  would take care  down in surrey  that these unsocial impulses  bred more than anything by the lack of good blood  were held in control 
1487,and then stole out from her hiding place and mounted her throne that goddess whose lust is to override opposition  to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself 
1488,naked  defenceless  the exhausted  the friendless received the impress of sir william own will 
1489,he swooped  he devoured 
1490,he shut people up 
1491,it was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared sir william so greatly to the relations of his victims 
1492,but rezia warren smith cried  walking down harley street  that she did not like that man 
1493,shredding and slicing  dividing and subdividing  the clocks of harley street nibbled at the june day  counselled submission  upheld authority  and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion  until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock  suspended above a shop in oxford street  announced  genially and fraternally  as if it were a pleasure to messrs  rigby and lowndes to give the information gratis  that it was half past one 
1494,looking up  it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours  subconsciously one was grateful to rigby and lowndes for giving one time ratified by greenwich  and this gratitude  so hugh whitbread ruminated  dallying there in front of the shop window   naturally took the form later of buying off rigby and lowndes socks or shoes 
1495,so he ruminated 
1496,it was his habit 
1497,he did not go deeply 
1498,he brushed surfaces  the dead languages  the living  life in constantinople  paris  rome  riding  shooting  tennis  it had been once 
1499,the malicious asserted that he now kept guard at buckingham palace  dressed in silk stockings and knee breeches  over what nobody knew 
1500,but he did it extremely efficiently 
1501,he had been afloat on the cream of english society for fifty five years 
1502,he had known prime ministers 
1503,his affections were understood to be deep 
1504,and if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office  one or two humble reforms stood to his credit  an improvement in public shelters was one  the protection of owls in norfolk another  servant girls had reason to be grateful to him  and his name at the end of letters to the times  asking for funds  appealing to the public to protect  to preserve  to clear up litter  to abate smoke  and stamp out immorality in parks  commanded respect 
1505,a magnificent figure he cut too  pausing for a moment  as the sound of the half hour died away  to look critically  magisterially  at socks and shoes  impeccable  substantial  as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence  and dressed to match  but realised the obligations which size  wealth  health  entail  and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary  little courtesies  old fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner  something to imitate  something to remember him by  for he would never lunch  for example  with lady bruton  whom he had known these twenty years  without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking miss brush  lady bruton own secretary  after her brother in south africa  which  for some reason  miss brush  deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm  so much resented that she said  thank you  he is doing very well in south africa   when  for half a dozen years  he had been doing badly in portsmouth 
1506,lady bruton herself preferred richard dalloway  who arrived at the next moment 
1507,indeed they met on the doorstep 
1508,lady bruton preferred richard dalloway of course 
1509,he was made of much finer material 
1510,but she would not let them run down her poor dear hugh 
1511,she could never forget his kindness  he had been really remarkably kind  she forgot precisely upon what occasion 
1512,but he had been  remarkably kind  anyhow  the difference between one man and another does not amount to much  she had never seen the sense of cutting people up  as clarissa dalloway did  cutting them up and sticking them together again  not at any rate when one was sixty two 
1513,she took hugh own carnations with her angular grim smile 
1514,there was nobody else coming  she said 
1515,she had got them there on false pretences  to help her out of a difficulty  
1516, but let us eat first   she said 
1517,and so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white capped maids  handmaidens not of necessity  but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in mayfair from one thirty to two  when  with a wave of the hand  the traffic ceases  and there rises instead this profound illusion in the first place about the food  how it is not paid for  and then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver  little mats  saucers of red fruit  films of brown cream mask turbot  in casseroles severed chickens swim  coloured  undomestic  the fire burns  and with the wine and the coffee  not paid for  rise jocund visions before musing eyes  gently speculative eyes  eyes to whom life appears musical  mysterious  eyes now kindled to observe genially the beauty of the red carnations which lady bruton  whose movements were always angular  had laid beside her plate  so that hugh whitbread  feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing  said  resting his fork 
1518, would not they look charming against your lace  
1519,miss brush resented this familiarity intensely 
1520,she thought him an underbred fellow 
1521,she made lady bruton laugh 
1522,lady bruton raised the carnations  holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the general held the scroll in the picture behind her  she remained fixed  tranced 
1523,which was she now  the general own great grand daughter 
1524,great great grand daughter 
1525,richard dalloway asked himself 
1526,sir roderick  sir miles  sir talbot  that was it 
1527,it was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women 
1528,she should have been a general of dragoons herself 
1529,and richard would have served under her  cheerfully  he had the greatest respect for her  he cherished these romantic views about well set up old women of pedigree  and would have liked  in his good humoured way  to bring some young hot heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her  as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea drinking enthusiasts 
1530,he knew her country 
1531,he knew her people 
1532,there was a vine  still bearing  which either lovelace or herrick  she never read a word poetry of herself  but so the story ran  had sat under 
1533,better wait to put before them the question that bothered her  about making an appeal to the public  if so  in what terms and so on   better wait until they have had their coffee  lady bruton thought  and so laid the carnations down beside her plate 
1534, how is clarissa   she asked abruptly 
1535,clarissa always said that lady bruton did not like her 
1536,indeed  lady bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people  of talking like a man  of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties  which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs 
1537,certainly there was an alcove in her drawing room  and a table in that alcove  and a photograph upon that table of general sir talbot moore  now deceased  who had written there  one evening in the eighties  in lady bruton own presence  with her cognisance  perhaps advice  a telegram ordering the british troops to advance upon an historical occasion 
1538, she kept the pen and told the story  
1539,thus  when she said in her offhand way  how is clarissa   husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed  however devoted  were secretly doubtful themselves  of her interest in women who often got in their husbands  way  prevented them from accepting posts abroad  and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza 
1540,nevertheless her inquiry   how is clarissa   was known by women infallibly  to be a signal from a well wisher  from an almost silent companion  whose utterances  half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime  signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united lady bruton and mrs  dalloway  who seldom met  and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile  in a singular bond 
1541, i met clarissa in the park this morning   said hugh whitbread  diving into the casserole  anxious to pay himself this little tribute  for he had only to come to london and he met everybody at once  but greedy  one of the greediest men she had ever known  milly brush thought  who observed men with unflinching rectitude  and was capable of everlasting devotion  to her own sex in particular  being knobbed  scraped  angular  and entirely without feminine charm 
1542, d you know who is in town   said lady bruton suddenly bethinking her 
1543, our old friend  peter walsh  
1544,they all smiled 
1545,peter walsh 
1546,and mr  dalloway was genuinely glad  milly brush thought  and mr  whitbread thought only of his chicken 
1547,peter walsh 
1548,all three  lady bruton  hugh whitbread  and richard dalloway  remembered the same thing  how passionately peter had been in love  been rejected  gone to india  come a cropper  made a mess of things  and richard dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old fellow too 
1549,milly brush saw that  saw a depth in the brown of his eyes  saw him hesitate  consider  which interested her  as mr  dalloway always interested her  for what was he thinking  she wondered  about peter walsh 
1550,that peter walsh had been in love with clarissa  that he would go back directly after lunch and find clarissa  that he would tell her  in so many words  that he loved her 
1551,yes  he would say that 
1552,milly brush once might almost have fallen in love with these silences  and mr  dalloway was always so dependable  such a gentleman too 
1553,now  being forty  lady bruton had only to nod  or turn her head a little abruptly  and milly brush took the signal  however deeply she might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit  of an uncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle  because life had not offered her a trinket of the slightest value  not a curl  smile  lip  cheek  nose  nothing whatever  lady bruton had only to nod  and perkins was instructed to quicken the coffee 
1554, yes  peter walsh has come back   said lady bruton 
1555,it was vaguely flattering to them all 
1556,he had come back  battered  unsuccessful  to their secure shores 
1557,but to help him  they reflected  was impossible  there was some flaw in his character 
1558,hugh whitbread said one might of course mention his name to so and so 
1559,he wrinkled lugubriously  consequentially  at the thought of the letters he would write to the heads of government offices about  my old friend  peter walsh   and so on 
1560,but it would not lead to anything  not to anything permanent  because of his character 
1561, in trouble with some woman   said lady bruton 
1562,they had all guessed that that was at the bottom of it 
1563, however   said lady bruton  anxious to leave the subject   we shall hear the whole story from peter himself  
1564, the coffee was very slow in coming  
1565, the address   murmured hugh whitbread  and there was at once a ripple in the grey tide of service which washed round lady bruton day in  day out  collecting  intercepting  enveloping her in a fine tissue which broke concussions  mitigated interruptions  and spread round the house in brook street a fine net where things lodged and were picked out accurately  instantly  by grey haired perkins  who had been with lady bruton these thirty years and now wrote down the address  handed it to mr  whitbread  who took out his pocket book  raised his eyebrows  and slipping it in among documents of the highest importance  said that he would get evelyn to ask him to lunch 
1566, they were waiting to bring the coffee until mr  whitbread had finished  
1567,hugh was very slow  lady bruton thought 
1568,he was getting fat  she noticed 
1569,richard always kept himself in the pink of condition 
1570,she was getting impatient  the whole of her being was setting positively  undeniably  domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary trifling  peter walsh and his affairs  upon that subject which engaged her attention  and not merely her attention  but that fibre which was the ramrod of her soul  that essential part of her without which millicent bruton would not have been millicent bruton  that project for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable parents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in canada 
1571,she exaggerated 
1572,she had perhaps lost her sense of proportion 
1573,emigration was not to others the obvious remedy  the sublime conception 
1574,it was not to them  not to hugh  or richard  or even to devoted miss brush  the liberator of the pent egotism  which a strong martial woman  well nourished  well descended  of direct impulses  downright feelings  and little introspective power  broad and simple  why could not every one be broad and simple  she asked  feels rise within her  once youth is past  and must eject upon some object  it may be emigration  it may be emancipation  but whatever it be  this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted  becomes inevitably prismatic  lustrous  half looking glass  half precious stone  now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it  now proudly displayed 
1575,emigration had become  in short  largely lady bruton 
1576,but she had to write 
1577,and one letter to the times  she used to say to miss brush  cost her more than to organise an expedition to south africa  which she had done in the war  
1578,after a morning own battle beginning  tearing up  beginning again  she used to feel the futility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion  and would turn gratefully to the thought of hugh whitbread who possessed  no one could doubt it  the art of writing letters to the times 
1579,a being so differently constituted from herself  with such a command of language  able to put things as editors like them put  had passions which one could not call simply greed 
1580,lady bruton often suspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in which they  but no woman  stood to the laws of the universe  knew how to put things  knew what was said  so that if richard advised her  and hugh wrote for her  she was sure of being somehow right 
1581,so she let hugh eat his souffl   asked after poor evelyn  waited until they were smoking  and then said 
1582, milly  would you fetch the papers  
1583,and miss brush went out  came back  laid papers on the table  and hugh produced his fountain pen  his silver fountain pen  which had done twenty years  service  he said  unscrewing the cap 
1584,it was still in perfect order  he had shown it to the makers  there was no reason  they said  why it should ever wear out  which was somehow to hugh own credit  and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed  so richard dalloway felt  as hugh began carefully writing capital letters with rings round them in the margin  and thus marvellously reduced lady bruton own tangles to sense  to grammar such as the editor of the times  lady bruton felt  watching the marvellous transformation  must respect 
1585,hugh was slow 
1586,hugh was pertinacious 
1587,richard said one must take risks 
1588,hugh proposed modifications in deference to people own feelings  which  he said rather tartly when richard laughed   had to be considered   and read out  how  therefore  we are of opinion that the times are ripe       the superfluous youth of our ever increasing population       what we owe to the dead        which richard thought all stuffing and bunkum  but no harm in it  of course  and hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility  brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat  and summing up now and then the progress they had made until  finally  he read out the draft of a letter which lady bruton felt certain was a masterpiece 
1589,could her own meaning sound like that 
1590,hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in  but he would be meeting somebody at luncheon 
1591,whereupon lady bruton  who seldom did a graceful thing  stuffed all hugh own carnations into the front of her dress  and flinging her hands out called him  my prime minister  
1592,what she would have done without them both she did not know 
1593,they rose 
1594,and richard dalloway strolled off as usual to have a look at the general own portrait  because he meant  whenever he had a moment of leisure  to write a history of lady bruton own family 
1595,and millicent bruton was very proud of her family 
1596,but they could wait  they could wait  she said  looking at the picture  meaning that her family  of military men  administrators  admirals  had been men of action  who had done their duty  and richard own first duty was to his country  but it was a fine face  she said  and all the papers were ready for richard down at aldmixton whenever the time came  the labour government she meant 
1597, ah  the news from india   she cried 
1598,and then  as they stood in the hall taking yellow gloves from the bowl on the malachite table and hugh was offering miss brush with quite unnecessary courtesy some discarded ticket or other compliment  which she loathed from the depths of her heart and blushed brick red  richard turned to lady bruton  with his hat in his hand  and said 
1599, we shall see you at our party to night   whereupon lady bruton resumed the magnificence which letter writing had shattered 
1600,she might come  or she might not come 
1601,clarissa had wonderful energy 
1602,parties terrified lady bruton 
1603,but then  she was getting old 
1604,so she intimated  standing at her doorway  handsome  very erect  while her chow stretched behind her  and miss brush disappeared into the background with her hands full of papers 
1605,and lady bruton went ponderously  majestically  up to her room  lay  one arm extended  on the sofa 
1606,she sighed  she snored  not that she was asleep  only drowsy and heavy  drowsy and heavy  like a field of clover in the sunshine this hot june day  with the bees going round and about and the yellow butterflies 
1607,always she went back to those fields down in devonshire  where she had jumped the brooks on patty  her pony  with mortimer and tom  her brothers 
1608,and there were the dogs  there were the rats  there were her father and mother on the lawn under the trees  with the tea things out  and the beds of dahlias  the hollyhocks  the pampas grass  and they  little wretches  always up to some mischief  stealing back through the shrubbery  so as not to be seen  all bedraggled from some roguery 
1609,what old nurse used to say about her frocks 
1610,ah dear  she remembered  it was wednesday in brook street 
1611,those kind good fellows  richard dalloway  hugh whitbread  had gone this hot day through the streets whose growl came up to her lying on the sofa 
1612,power was hers  position  income 
1613,she had lived in the forefront of her time 
1614,she had had good friends  known the ablest men of her day 
1615,murmuring london flowed up to her  and her hand  lying on the sofa back  curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held  holding which she seemed  drowsy and heavy  to be commanding battalions marching to canada  and those good fellows walking across london  that territory of theirs  that little bit of carpet  mayfair 
1616,and they went further and further from her  being attached to her by a thin thread  since they had lunched with her  which would stretch and stretch  get thinner and thinner as they walked across london  as if one own friends were attached to one own body  after lunching with them  by a thin thread  which  as she dozed there  became hazy with the sound of bells  striking the hour or ringing to service  as a single spider own thread is blotted with rain drops  and  burdened  sags down 
1617,so she slept 
1618,and richard dalloway and hugh whitbread hesitated at the corner of conduit street at the very moment that millicent bruton  lying on the sofa  let the thread snap  snored 
1619,contrary winds buffeted at the street corner 
1620,they looked in at a shop window  they did not wish to buy or to talk but to part  only with contrary winds buffeting the street corner  with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body  two forces meeting in a swirl  morning and afternoon  they paused 
1621,some newspaper placard went up in the air  gallantly  like a kite at first  then paused  swooped  fluttered  and a lady own veil hung 
1622,yellow awnings trembled 
1623,the speed of the morning traffic slackened  and single carts rattled carelessly down half empty streets 
1624,in norfolk  of which richard dalloway was half thinking  a soft warm wind blew back the petals  confused the waters  ruffled the flowering grasses 
1625,haymakers  who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil  parted curtains of green blades  moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky  the blue  the steadfast  the blazing summer sky 
1626,aware that he was looking at a silver two handled jacobean mug  and that hugh whitbread admired condescendingly with airs of connoisseurship a spanish necklace which he thought of asking the price of in case evelyn might like it  still richard was torpid  could not think or move  life had thrown up this wreckage  shop windows full of coloured paste  and one stood stark with the lethargy of the old  stiff with the rigidity of the old  looking in  evelyn whitbread might like to buy this spanish necklace  so she might 
1627,yawn he must 
1628,hugh was going into the shop 
1629, right you are   said richard  following 
1630,goodness knows he did not want to go buying necklaces with hugh 
1631,but there are tides in the body 
1632,morning meets afternoon 
1633,borne like a frail shallop on deep  deep floods  lady bruton own great grandfather and his memoir and his campaigns in north america were whelmed and sunk 
1634,and millicent bruton too 
1635,she went under 
1636,richard did not care a straw what became of emigration  about that letter  whether the editor put it in or not 
1637,the necklace hung stretched between hugh own admirable fingers 
1638,let him give it to a girl  if he must buy jewels  any girl  any girl in the street  for the worthlessness of this life did strike richard pretty forcibly  buying necklaces for evelyn 
1639,if he would had a boy he would have said  work  work 
1640,but he had his elizabeth  he adored his elizabeth 
1641, i should like to see mr  dubonnet   said hugh in his curt worldly way 
1642,it appeared that this dubonnet had the measurements of mrs  whitbread own neck  or  more strangely still  knew her views upon spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line  which hugh could not remember  
1643,all of which seemed to richard dalloway awfully odd 
1644,for he never gave clarissa presents  except a bracelet two or three years ago  which had not been a success 
1645,she never wore it 
1646,it pained him to remember that she never wore it 
1647,and as a single spider own thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf  so richard own mind  recovering from its lethargy  set now on his wife  clarissa  whom peter walsh had loved so passionately  and richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon  of himself and clarissa  of their life together  and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him  and taking up first this brooch then that ring   how much is that   he asked  but doubted his own taste 
1648,he wanted to open the drawing room door and come in holding out something  a present for clarissa 
1649,only what 
1650,but hugh was on his legs again 
1651,he was unspeakably pompous 
1652,really  after dealing here for thirty five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business 
1653,for dubonnet  it seemed  was out  and hugh would not buy anything until mr  dubonnet chose to be in  at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow 
1654,it was all perfectly correct 
1655,and yet richard could not have said that to save his life 
1656,why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive 
1657,hugh was becoming an intolerable ass 
1658,richard dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society 
1659,and  flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell  richard turned at the corner of conduit street eager  yes  very eager  to travel that spider own thread of attachment between himself and clarissa  he would go straight to her  in westminster 
1660,but he wanted to come in holding something 
1661,flowers 
1662,yes  flowers  since he did not trust his taste in gold  any number of flowers  roses  orchids  to celebrate what was  reckoning things as you will  an event  this feeling about her when they spoke of peter walsh at luncheon  and they never spoke of it  not for years had they spoken of it  which  he thought  grasping his red and white roses together  a vast bunch in tissue paper   is the greatest mistake in the world 
1663,the time comes when it cannot be said  one own too shy to say it  he thought  pocketing his sixpence or two of change  setting off with his great bunch held against his body to westminster to say straight out in so many words  whatever she might think of him   holding out his flowers   i love you  
1664,why not 
1665,really it was a miracle thinking of the war  and thousands of poor chaps  with all their lives before them  shovelled together  already half forgotten  it was a miracle 
1666,here he was walking across london to say to clarissa in so many words that he loved her 
1667,which one never does say  he thought 
1668,partly one own lazy  partly one own shy 
1669,and clarissa  it was difficult to think of her  except in starts  as at luncheon  when he saw her quite distinctly  their whole life  he stopped at the crossing  and repeated  being simple by nature  and undebauched  because he had tramped  and shot  being pertinacious and dogged  having championed the down trodden and followed his instincts in the house of commons  being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless  rather stiff  he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married clarissa  a miracle  his life had been a miracle  he thought  hesitating to cross 
1670,but it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing piccadilly alone 
1671,the police ought to have stopped the traffic at once 
1672,he had no illusions about the london police 
1673,indeed  he was collecting evidence of their malpractices  and those costermongers  not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets  and prostitutes  good lord  the fault was not in them  nor in young men either  but in our detestable social system and so forth  all of which he considered  could be seen considering  grey  dogged  dapper  clean  as he walked across the park to tell his wife that he loved her 
1674,for he would say it in so many words  when he came into the room 
1675,because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels  he thought  crossing the green park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families  poor families  were sprawling  children kicking up their legs  sucking milk  paper bags thrown about  which could easily be picked up  if people objected  by one of those fat gentlemen in livery  for he was of opinion that every park  and every square  during the summer months should be open to children  the grass of the park flushed and faded  lighting up the poor mothers of westminster and their crawling babies  as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath  
1676,but what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature  stretched on her elbow  as if she had flung herself on the earth  rid of all ties  to observe curiously  to speculate boldly  to consider the why is and the wherefores  impudent  loose lipped  humorous   he did not know 
1677,bearing his flowers like a weapon  richard dalloway approached her  intent he passed her  still there was time for a spark between them  she laughed at the sight of him  he smiled good humouredly  considering the problem of the female vagrant  not that they would ever speak 
1678,but he would tell clarissa that he loved her  in so many words 
1679,he had  once upon a time  been jealous of peter walsh  jealous of him and clarissa 
1680,but she had often said to him that she had been right not to marry peter walsh  which  knowing clarissa  was obviously true  she wanted support 
1681,not that she was weak  but she wanted support 
1682,as for buckingham palace  like an old prima donna facing the audience all in white  you cannot deny it a certain dignity  he considered  nor despise what does  after all  stand to millions of people  a little crowd was waiting at the gate to see the king drive out  for a symbol  absurd though it is  a child with a box of bricks could have done better  he thought  looking at the memorial to queen victoria  whom he could remember in her horn spectacles driving through kensington   its white mound  its billowing motherliness  but he liked being ruled by the descendant of horsa  he liked continuity  and the sense of handing on the traditions of the past 
1683,it was a great age in which to have lived 
1684,indeed  his own life was a miracle  let him make no mistake about it  here he was  in the prime of life  walking to his house in westminster to tell clarissa that he loved her 
1685,happiness is this he thought 
1686,it is this  he said  as he entered dean own yard 
1687,big ben was beginning to strike  first the warning  musical  then the hour  irrevocable 
1688,lunch parties waste the entire afternoon  he thought  approaching his door 
1689,the sound of big ben flooded clarissa own drawing room  where she sat  ever so annoyed  at her writing table  worried  annoyed 
1690,it was perfectly true that she had not asked ellie henderson to her party  but she had done it on purpose 
1691,now mrs  marsham wrote  she had told ellie henderson she would ask clarissa  ellie so much wanted to come  
1692,but why should she invite all the dull women in london to her parties 
1693,why should mrs  marsham interfere 
1694,and there was elizabeth closeted all this time with doris kilman 
1695,anything more nauseating she could not conceive 
1696,prayer at this hour with that woman 
1697,and the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave  which receded  and gathered itself together to fall once more  when she heard  distractingly  something fumbling  something scratching at the door 
1698,who at this hour 
1699,three  good heavens 
1700,three already 
1701,for with overpowering directness and dignity the clock struck three  and she heard nothing else  but the door handle slipped round and in came richard 
1702,what a surprise 
1703,in came richard  holding out flowers 
1704,she had failed him  once at constantinople  and lady bruton  whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing  had not asked her 
1705,he was holding out flowers  roses  red and white roses 
1706, but he could not bring himself to say he loved her  not in so many words  
1707,but how lovely  she said  taking his flowers 
1708,she understood  she understood without his speaking  his clarissa 
1709,she put them in vases on the mantelpiece 
1710,how lovely they looked  she said 
1711,and was it amusing  she asked 
1712,had lady bruton asked after her 
1713,peter walsh was back 
1714,mrs  marsham had written 
1715,must she ask ellie henderson 
1716,that woman kilman was upstairs 
1717, but let us sit down for five minutes   said richard 
1718,it all looked so empty 
1719,all the chairs were against the wall 
1720,what had they been doing 
1721,oh  it was for the party  no  he had not forgotten  the party 
1722,peter walsh was back 
1723,oh yes  she had had him 
1724,and he was going to get a divorce  and he was in love with some woman out there 
1725,and he had not changed in the slightest 
1726,there she was  mending her dress       
1727, thinking of bourton   she said 
1728, hugh was at lunch   said richard 
1729,she had met him too 
1730,well  he was getting absolutely intolerable 
1731,buying evelyn necklaces  fatter than ever  an intolerable ass 
1732, and it came over me  i might have married you    she said  thinking of peter sitting there in his little bow tie  with that knife  opening it  shutting it 
1733, just as he always was  you know  
1734,they were talking about him at lunch  said richard 
1735, but he could not tell her he loved her  he held her hand  happiness is this  he thought  
1736,they had been writing a letter to the times for millicent bruton 
1737,that was about all hugh was fit for 
1738, and our dear miss kilman   he asked 
1739,clarissa thought the roses absolutely lovely  first bunched together  now of their own accord starting apart 
1740, kilman arrives just as we have done lunch   she said 
1741, elizabeth turns pink  they shut themselves up  i suppose they are praying  
1742,lord 
1743,he did not like it  but these things pass over if you let them 
1744, in a mackintosh with an umbrella   said clarissa 
1745,he had not said  i love you   but he held her hand 
1746,happiness is this  is this  he thought 
1747, but why should i ask all the dull women in london to my parties   said clarissa 
1748,and if mrs  marsham gave a party  did she invite her guests 
1749, poor ellie henderson   said richard  it was a very odd thing how much clarissa minded about her parties  he thought 
1750,but richard had no notion of the look of a room 
1751,however  what was he going to say 
1752,if she worried about these parties he would not let her give them 
1753,did she wish she had married peter 
1754,but he must go 
1755,he must be off  he said  getting up 
1756,but he stood for a moment as if he were about to say something  and she wondered what 
1757,why 
1758,there were the roses 
1759, some committee   she asked  as he opened the door 
1760, armenians   he said  or perhaps it was  albanians  
1761,and there is a dignity in people  a solitude  even between husband and wife a gulf  and that one must respect  thought clarissa  watching him open the door  for one would not part with it oneself  or take it  against his will  from one own husband  without losing one own independence  one own self respect  something  after all  priceless 
1762,he returned with a pillow and a quilt 
1763, an hour own complete rest after luncheon   he said 
1764,and he went 
1765,how like him 
1766,he would go on saying  an hour own complete rest after luncheon  to the end of time  because a doctor had ordered it once 
1767,it was like him to take what doctors said literally  part of his adorable  divine simplicity  which no one had to the same extent  which made him go and do the thing while she and peter frittered their time away bickering 
1768,he was already halfway to the house of commons  to his armenians  his albanians  having settled her on the sofa  looking at his roses 
1769,and people would say   clarissa dalloway is spoilt  
1770,she cared much more for her roses than for the armenians 
1771,hunted out of existence  maimed  frozen  the victims of cruelty and injustice  she had heard richard say so over and over again   no  she could feel nothing for the albanians  or was it the armenians  but she loved her roses  did not that help the armenians    the only flowers she could bear to see cut 
1772,but richard was already at the house of commons  at his committee  having settled all her difficulties 
1773,but no  alas  that was not true 
1774,he did not see the reasons against asking ellie henderson 
1775,she would do it  of course  as he wished it 
1776,since he had brought the pillows  she would lie down 
1777,      but  but  why did she suddenly feel  for no reason that she could discover  desperately unhappy 
1778,as a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully  this way and that  and searches here and there vainly  and at last spies it there at the roots  so she went through one thing and another  no  it was not sally seton saying that richard would never be in the cabinet because he had a second class brain  it came back to her   no  she did not mind that  nor was it to do with elizabeth either and doris kilman  those were facts 
1779,it was a feeling  some unpleasant feeling  earlier in the day perhaps  something that peter had said  combined with some depression of her own  in her bedroom  taking off her hat  and what richard had said had added to it  but what had he said 
1780,there were his roses 
1781,her parties 
1782,that was it 
1783,her parties 
1784,both of them criticised her very unfairly  laughed at her very unjustly  for her parties 
1785,that was it 
1786,that was it 
1787,well  how was she going to defend herself 
1788,now that she knew what it was  she felt perfectly happy 
1789,they thought  or peter at any rate thought  that she enjoyed imposing herself  liked to have famous people about her  great names  was simply a snob in short 
1790,well  peter might think so 
1791,richard merely thought it foolish of her to like excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart 
1792,it was childish  he thought 
1793,and both were quite wrong 
1794,what she liked was simply life 
1795, that is what i do it for   she said  speaking aloud  to life 
1796,since she was lying on the sofa  cloistered  exempt  the presence of this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically existent  with robes of sound from the street  sunny  with hot breath  whispering  blowing out the blinds 
1797,but suppose peter said to her   yes  yes  but your parties  what is the sense of your parties   all she could say was  and nobody could be expected to understand   they are an offering  which sounded horribly vague  but who was peter to make out that life was all plain sailing   peter always in love  always in love with the wrong woman 
1798,what is your love 
1799,she might say to him 
1800,and she knew his answer  how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman possibly understood it 
1801,very well 
1802,but could any man understand what she meant either 
1803,about life 
1804,she could not imagine peter or richard taking the trouble to give a party for no reason whatever 
1805,but to go deeper  beneath what people said  and these judgements  how superficial  how fragmentary they are   in her own mind now  what did it mean to her  this thing she called life 
1806,oh  it was very queer 
1807,here was so and so in south kensington  some one up in bayswater  and somebody else  say  in mayfair 
1808,and she felt quite continuously a sense of their existence  and she felt what a waste  and she felt what a pity  and she felt if only they could be brought together  so she did it 
1809,and it was an offering  to combine  to create  but to whom 
1810,an offering for the sake of offering  perhaps 
1811,anyhow  it was her gift 
1812,nothing else had she of the slightest importance  could not think  write  even play the piano 
1813,she muddled armenians and turks  loved success  hated discomfort  must be liked  talked oceans of nonsense  and to this day  ask her what the equator was  and she did not know 
1814,all the same  that one day should follow another  wednesday  thursday  friday  saturday  that one should wake up in the morning  see the sky  walk in the park  meet hugh whitbread  then suddenly in came peter  then these roses  it was enough 
1815,after that  how unbelievable death was   that it must end  and no one in the whole world would know how she had loved it all  how  every instant
1816,the door opened 
1817,elizabeth knew that her mother was resting 
1818,she came in very quietly 
1819,she stood perfectly still 
1820,was it that some mongol had been wrecked on the coast of norfolk  as mrs  hilbery said   had mixed with the dalloway ladies  perhaps  a hundred years ago 
1821,for the dalloways  in general  were fair haired  blue eyed  elizabeth  on the contrary  was dark  had chinese eyes in a pale face  an oriental mystery  was gentle  considerate  still 
1822,as a child  she had had a perfect sense of humour  but now at seventeen  why  clarissa could not in the least understand  she had become very serious  like a hyacinth  sheathed in glossy green  with buds just tinted  a hyacinth which has had no sun 
1823,she stood quite still and looked at her mother  but the door was ajar  and outside the door was miss kilman  as clarissa knew  miss kilman in her mackintosh  listening to whatever they said 
1824,yes  miss kilman stood on the landing  and wore a mackintosh  but had her reasons 
1825,first  it was cheap  second  she was over forty  and did not  after all  dress to please 
1826,she was poor  moreover  degradingly poor 
1827,otherwise she would not be taking jobs from people like the dalloways  from rich people  who liked to be kind 
1828,mr  dalloway  to do him justice  had been kind 
1829,but mrs  dalloway had not 
1830,she had been merely condescending 
1831,she came from the most worthless of all classes  the rich  with a smattering of culture 
1832,they had expensive things everywhere  pictures  carpets  lots of servants 
1833,she considered that she had a perfect right to anything that the dalloways did for her 
1834,she had been cheated 
1835,yes  the word was no exaggeration  for surely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness 
1836,and she had never been happy  what with being so clumsy and so poor 
1837,and then  just as she might have had a chance at miss dolby own school  the war came  and she had never been able to tell lies 
1838,miss dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the germans 
1839,she had had to go 
1840,it was true that the family was of german origin  spelt the name kiehlman in the eighteenth century  but her brother had been killed 
1841,they turned her out because she would not pretend that the germans were all villains  when she had german friends  when the only happy days of her life had been spent in germany 
1842,and after all  she could read history 
1843,she had had to take whatever she could get 
1844,mr  dalloway had come across her working for the friends 
1845,he had allowed her  and that was really generous of him  to teach his daughter history 
1846,also she did a little extension lecturing and so on 
1847,then our lord had come to her  and here she always bowed her head  
1848,she had seen the light two years and three months ago 
1849,now she did not envy women like clarissa dalloway  she pitied them 
1850,she pitied and despised them from the bottom of her heart  as she stood on the soft carpet  looking at the old engraving of a little girl with a muff 
1851,with all this luxury going on  what hope was there for a better state of things 
1852,instead of lying on a sofa   my mother is resting   elizabeth had said  she should have been in a factory  behind a counter  mrs  dalloway and all the other fine ladies 
1853,bitter and burning  miss kilman had turned into a church two years three months ago 
1854,she had heard the rev  edward whittaker preach  the boys sing  had seen the solemn lights descend  and whether it was the music  or the voices  she herself when alone in the evening found comfort in a violin  but the sound was excruciating  she had no ear   the hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had been assuaged as she sat there  and she had wept copiously  and gone to call on mr  whittaker at his private house in kensington 
1855,it was the hand of god  he said 
1856,the lord had shown her the way 
1857,so now  whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her  this hatred of mrs  dalloway  this grudge against the world  she thought of god 
1858,she thought of mr  whittaker 
1859,rage was succeeded by calm 
1860,a sweet savour filled her veins  her lips parted  and  standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh  she looked with steady and sinister serenity at mrs  dalloway  who came out with her daughter 
1861,elizabeth said she had forgotten her gloves 
1862,that was because miss kilman and her mother hated each other 
1863,she could not bear to see them together 
1864,she ran upstairs to find her gloves 
1865,but miss kilman did not hate mrs  dalloway 
1866,turning her large gooseberry coloured eyes upon clarissa  observing her small pink face  her delicate body  her air of freshness and fashion  miss kilman felt  fool 
1867,simpleton 
1868,you who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure  who have trifled your life away 
1869,and there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her  to unmask her 
1870,if she could have felled her it would have eased her 
1871,but it was not the body  it was the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue  make feel her mastery 
1872,if only she could make her weep  could ruin her  humiliate her  bring her to her knees crying  you are right 
1873,but this was god own will  not miss kilman own 
1874,it was to be a religious victory 
1875,so she glared  so she glowered 
1876,clarissa was really shocked 
1877,this a christian  this woman 
1878,this woman had taken her daughter from her 
1879,she in touch with invisible presences 
1880,heavy  ugly  commonplace  without kindness or grace  she know the meaning of life 
1881, you are taking elizabeth to the stores  
1882,mrs  dalloway said 
1883,miss kilman said she was 
1884,they stood there 
1885,miss kilman was not going to make herself agreeable 
1886,she had always earned her living 
1887,her knowledge of modern history was thorough in the extreme 
1888,she did out of her meagre income set aside so much for causes she believed in  whereas this woman did nothing  believed nothing  brought up her daughter  but here was elizabeth  rather out of breath  the beautiful girl 
1889,so they were going to the stores 
1890,odd it was  as miss kilman stood there  and stand she did  with the power and taciturnity of some prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare   how  second by second  the idea of her diminished  how hatred  which was for ideas  not people  crumbled  how she lost her malignity  her size  became second by second merely miss kilman  in a mackintosh  whom heaven knows clarissa would have liked to help 
1891,at this dwindling of the monster  clarissa laughed 
1892,saying good bye  she laughed 
1893,off they went together  miss kilman and elizabeth  downstairs 
1894,with a sudden impulse  with a violent anguish  for this woman was taking her daughter from her  clarissa leant over the bannisters and cried out   remember the party  remember our party tonight  
1895,but elizabeth had already opened the front door  there was a van passing  she did not answer 
1896,love and religion  thought clarissa  going back into the drawing room  tingling all over 
1897,how detestable  how detestable they are 
1898,for now that the body of miss kilman was not before her  it overwhelmed her  the idea  the cruelest things in the world  she thought  seeing them clumsy  hot  domineering  hypocritical  eavesdropping  jealous  infinitely cruel and unscrupulous  dressed in a mackintosh coat  on the landing  love and religion  had she ever tried to convert any one herself  did she not wish everybody merely to be themselves  and she watched out of the window the old lady opposite climbing upstairs  let her climb upstairs if she wanted to  let her stop  then let her  as clarissa had often seen her  gain her bedroom  part her curtains  and disappear again into the background  somehow one respected that  that old woman looking out of the window  quite unconscious that she was being watched 
1899,there was something solemn in it  but love and religion would destroy that  whatever it was  the privacy of the soul 
1900,the odious kilman would destroy it 
1901,yet it was a sight that made her want to cry 
1902,love destroyed too 
1903,everything that was fine  everything that was true went 
1904,take peter walsh now 
1905,there was a man  charming  clever  with ideas about everything 
1906,if you wanted to know about pope  say  or addison  or just to talk nonsense  what people were like  what things meant  peter knew better than any one 
1907,it was peter who had helped her  peter who had lent her books 
1908,but look at the women he loved  vulgar  trivial  commonplace  think of peter in love  he came to see her after all these years  and what did he talk about 
1909,himself 
1910,horrible passion  she thought 
1911,degrading passion  she thought  thinking of kilman and her elizabeth walking to the army and navy stores 
1912,big ben struck the half hour 
1913,how extraordinary it was  strange  yes  touching  to see the old lady  they had been neighbours ever so many years  move away from the window  as if she were attached to that sound  that string 
1914,gigantic as it was  it had something to do with her 
1915,down  down  into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn 
1916,she was forced  so clarissa imagined  by that sound  to move  to go  but where 
1917,clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared  and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom 
1918,she was still there moving about at the other end of the room 
1919,why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes 
1920,when  thought clarissa  that is the miracle  that is the mystery  that old lady  she meant  whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing table 
1921,she could still see her 
1922,and the supreme mystery which kilman might say she had solved  or peter might say he had solved  but clarissa did not believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving  was simply this  here was one room  there another 
1923,did religion solve that  or love 
1924,love  but here the other clock  the clock which always struck two minutes after big ben  came shuffling in with its lap full of odds and ends  which it dumped down as if big ben were all very well with his majesty laying down the law  so solemn  so just  but she must remember all sorts of little things besides  mrs 
1925,marsham  ellie henderson  glasses for ices  all sorts of little things came flooding and lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which lay flat like a bar of gold on the sea 
1926,mrs  marsham  ellie henderson  glasses for ices 
1927,she must telephone now at once 
1928,volubly  troublously  the late clock sounded  coming in on the wake of big ben  with its lap full of trifles 
1929,beaten up  broken up by the assault of carriages  the brutality of vans  the eager advance of myriads of angular men  of flaunting women  the domes and spires of offices and hospitals  the last relics of this lap full of odds and ends seemed to break  like the spray of an exhausted wave  upon the body of miss kilman standing still in the street for a moment to mutter  it is the flesh  
1930,it was the flesh that she must control 
1931,clarissa dalloway had insulted her 
1932,that she expected 
1933,but she had not triumphed  she had not mastered the flesh 
1934,ugly  clumsy  clarissa dalloway had laughed at her for being that  and had revived the fleshly desires  for she minded looking as she did beside clarissa 
1935,nor could she talk as she did 
1936,but why wish to resemble her 
1937,why 
1938,she despised mrs  dalloway from the bottom of her heart 
1939,she was not serious 
1940,she was not good 
1941,her life was a tissue of vanity and deceit 
1942,yet doris kilman had been overcome 
1943,she had  as a matter of fact  very nearly burst into tears when clarissa dalloway laughed at her 
1944, it is the flesh  it is the flesh   she muttered  it being her habit to talk aloud  trying to subdue this turbulent and painful feeling as she walked down victoria street 
1945,she prayed to god 
1946,she could not help being ugly  she could not afford to buy pretty clothes 
1947,clarissa dalloway had laughed  but she would concentrate her mind upon something else until she had reached the pillar box 
1948,at any rate she had got elizabeth 
1949,but she would think of something else  she would think of russia  until she reached the pillar box 
1950,how nice it must be  she said  in the country  struggling  as mr  whittaker had told her  with that violent grudge against the world which had scorned her  sneered at her  cast her off  beginning with this indignity  the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see 
1951,do her hair as she might  her forehead remained like an egg  bald  white 
1952,no clothes suited her 
1953,she might buy anything 
1954,and for a woman  of course  that meant never meeting the opposite sex 
1955,never would she come first with any one 
1956,sometimes lately it had seemed to her that  except for elizabeth  her food was all that she lived for  her comforts  her dinner  her tea  her hot water bottle at night 
1957,but one must fight  vanquish  have faith in god 
1958,mr  whittaker had said she was there for a purpose 
1959,but no one knew the agony 
1960,he said  pointing to the crucifix  that god knew 
1961,but why should she have to suffer when other women  like clarissa dalloway  escaped 
1962,knowledge comes through suffering  said mr  whittaker 
1963,she had passed the pillar box  and elizabeth had turned into the cool brown tobacco department of the army and navy stores while she was still muttering to herself what mr  whittaker had said about knowledge coming through suffering and the flesh 
1964, the flesh   she muttered 
1965,what department did she want 
1966,elizabeth interrupted her 
1967, petticoats   she said abruptly  and stalked straight on to the lift 
1968,up they went 
1969,elizabeth guided her this way and that  guided her in her abstraction as if she had been a great child  an unwieldy battleship 
1970,there were the petticoats  brown  decorous  striped  frivolous  solid  flimsy  and she chose  in her abstraction  portentously  and the girl serving thought her mad 
1971,elizabeth rather wondered  as they did up the parcel  what miss kilman was thinking 
1972,they must have their tea  said miss kilman  rousing  collecting herself 
1973,they had their tea 
1974,elizabeth rather wondered whether miss kilman could be hungry 
1975,it was her way of eating  eating with intensity  then looking  again and again  at a plate of sugared cakes on the table next them  then  when a lady and a child sat down and the child took the cake  could miss kilman really mind it 
1976,yes  miss kilman did mind it 
1977,she had wanted that cake  the pink one 
1978,the pleasure of eating was almost the only pure pleasure left her  and then to be baffled even in that 
1979,when people are happy  they have a reserve  she had told elizabeth  upon which to draw  whereas she was like a wheel without a tyre  she was fond of such metaphors   jolted by every pebble  so she would say staying on after the lesson standing by the fire place with her bag of books  her  satchel   she called it  on a tuesday morning  after the lesson was over 
1980,and she talked too about the war 
1981,after all  there were people who did not think the english invariably right 
1982,there were books 
1983,there were meetings 
1984,there were other points of view 
1985,would elizabeth like to come with her to listen to so and so  a most extraordinary looking old man  
1986,then miss kilman took her to some church in kensington and they had tea with a clergyman 
1987,she had lent her books 
1988,law  medicine  politics  all professions are open to women of your generation  said miss kilman 
1989,but for herself  her career was absolutely ruined and was it her fault 
1990,good gracious  said elizabeth  no 
1991,and her mother would come calling to say that a hamper had come from bourton and would miss kilman like some flowers 
1992,to miss kilman she was always very  very nice  but miss kilman squashed the flowers all in a bunch  and had not any small talk  and what interested miss kilman bored her mother  and miss kilman and she were terrible together  and miss kilman swelled and looked very plain 
1993,but then miss kilman was frightfully clever 
1994,elizabeth had never thought about the poor 
1995,they lived with everything they wanted   her mother had breakfast in bed every day  lucy carried it up  and she liked old women because they were duchesses  and being descended from some lord 
1996,but miss kilman said  one of those tuesday mornings when the lesson was over    my grandfather kept an oil and colour shop in kensington  
1997,miss kilman made one feel so small 
1998,miss kilman took another cup of tea 
1999,elizabeth  with her oriental bearing  her inscrutable mystery  sat perfectly upright  no  she did not want anything more 
2000,she looked for her gloves  her white gloves 
2001,they were under the table 
2002,ah  but she must not go 
2003,miss kilman could not let her go  this youth  that was so beautiful  this girl  whom she genuinely loved 
2004,her large hand opened and shut on the table 
2005,but perhaps it was a little flat somehow  elizabeth felt 
2006,and really she would like to go 
2007,but said miss kilman   I have not quite finished yet  
2008,of course  then  elizabeth would wait 
2009,but it was rather stuffy in here 
2010, are you going to the party to night  
2011,miss kilman said 
2012,elizabeth supposed she was going  her mother wanted her to go 
2013,she must not let parties absorb her  miss kilman said  fingering the last two inches of a chocolate clair 
2014,she did not much like parties  elizabeth said 
2015,miss kilman opened her mouth  slightly projected her chin  and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate clair  then wiped her fingers  and washed the tea round in her cup 
2016,she was about to split asunder  she felt 
2017,the agony was so terrific 
2018,if she could grasp her  if she could clasp her  if she could make her hers absolutely and forever and then die  that was all she wanted 
2019,but to sit here  unable to think of anything to say  to see elizabeth turning against her  to be felt repulsive even by her  it was too much  she could not stand it 
2020,the thick fingers curled inwards 
2021, i never go to parties   said miss kilman  just to keep elizabeth from going 
2022, people do not ask me to parties   and she knew as she said it that it was this egotism that was her undoing  mr  whittaker had warned her  but she could not help it  she had suffered so horribly   why should they ask me   she said   I am plain  I am unhappy  
2023,she knew it was idiotic  but it was all those people passing  people with parcels who despised her  who made her say it 
2024,however  she was doris kilman 
2025,she had her degree 
2026,she was a woman who had made her way in the world 
2027,her knowledge of modern history was more than respectable 
2028, i do not pity myself   she said 
2029, i pity   she meant to say  your mother  but no  she could not  not to elizabeth 
2030, i pity other people   she said   more  
2031,like some dumb creature who has been brought up to a gate for an unknown purpose  and stands there longing to gallop away  elizabeth dalloway sat silent 
2032,was miss kilman going to say anything more 
2033, do not quite forget me   said doris kilman  her voice quivered 
2034,right away to the end of the field the dumb creature galloped in terror 
2035,the great hand opened and shut 
2036,elizabeth turned her head 
2037,the waitress came 
2038,one had to pay at the desk  elizabeth said  and went off  drawing out  so miss kilman felt  the very entrails in her body  stretching them as she crossed the room  and then  with a final twist  bowing her head very politely  she went 
2039,she had gone 
2040,miss kilman sat at the marble table among the clairs  stricken once  twice  thrice by shocks of suffering 
2041,she had gone 
2042,mrs  dalloway had triumphed 
2043,elizabeth had gone 
2044,beauty had gone  youth had gone 
2045,so she sat 
2046,she got up  blundered off among the little tables  rocking slightly from side to side  and somebody came after her with her petticoat  and she lost her way  and was hemmed in by trunks specially prepared for taking to india  next got among the accouchement sets  and baby linen  through all the commodities of the world  perishable and permanent  hams  drugs  flowers  stationery  variously smelling  now sweet  now sour she lurched  saw herself thus lurching with her hat askew  very red in the face  full length in a looking glass  and at last came out into the street 
2047,the tower of westminster cathedral rose in front of her  the habitation of god 
2048,in the midst of the traffic  there was the habitation of god 
2049,doggedly she set off with her parcel to that other sanctuary  the abbey  where  raising her hands in a tent before her face  she sat beside those driven into shelter too  the variously assorted worshippers  now divested of social rank  almost of sex  as they raised their hands before their faces  but once they removed them  instantly reverent  middle class  english men and women  some of them desirous of seeing the wax works 
2050,but miss kilman held her tent before her face 
2051,now she was deserted  now rejoined 
2052,new worshippers came in from the street to replace the strollers  and still  as people gazed round and shuffled past the tomb of the unknown warrior  still she barred her eyes with her fingers and tried in this double darkness  for the light in the abbey was bodiless  to aspire above the vanities  the desires  the commodities  to rid herself both of hatred and of love 
2053,her hands twitched 
2054,she seemed to struggle 
2055,yet to others god was accessible and the path to him smooth 
2056,mr  fletcher  retired  of the treasury  mrs  gorham  widow of the famous k c   approached him simply  and having done their praying  leant back  enjoyed the music  the organ pealed sweetly   and saw miss kilman at the end of the row  praying  praying  and  being still on the threshold of their underworld  thought of her sympathetically as a soul haunting the same territory  a soul cut out of immaterial substance  not a woman  a soul 
2057,but mr  fletcher had to go 
2058,he had to pass her  and being himself neat as a new pin  could not help being a little distressed by the poor lady own disorder  her hair down  her parcel on the floor 
2059,she did not at once let him pass 
2060,but  as he stood gazing about him  at the white marbles  grey window panes  and accumulated treasures  for he was extremely proud of the abbey   her largeness  robustness  and power as she sat there shifting her knees from time to time  it was so rough the approach to her god  so tough her desires  impressed him  as they had impressed mrs  dalloway  she could not get the thought of her out of her mind that afternoon   the rev  edward whittaker  and elizabeth too 
2061,and elizabeth waited in victoria street for an omnibus 
2062,it was so nice to be out of doors 
2063,she thought perhaps she need not go home just yet 
2064,it was so nice to be out in the air 
2065,so she would get on to an omnibus 
2066,and already  even as she stood there  in her very well cut clothes  it was beginning 
2067,      people were beginning to compare her to poplar trees  early dawn  hyacinths  fawns  running water  and garden lilies  and it made her life a burden to her  for she so much preferred being left alone to do what she liked in the country  but they would compare her to lilies  and she had to go to parties  and london was so dreary compared with being alone in the country with her father and the dogs 
2068,buses swooped  settled  were off  garish caravans  glistening with red and yellow varnish  but which should she get on to  she had no preferences  of course  she would not push her way  she inclined to be passive  it was expression she needed  but her eyes were fine  chinese  oriental  and  as her mother said  with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight  she was always charming to look at  and lately  in the evening especially  when she was interested  for she never seemed excited  she looked almost beautiful  very stately  very serene  what could she be thinking  every man fell in love with her  and she was really awfully bored  for it was beginning  her mother could see that  the compliments were beginning 
2069,that she did not care more about it  for instance for her clothes  sometimes worried clarissa  but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper  and it gave her a charm 
2070,and now there was this odd friendship with miss kilman 
2071,well  thought clarissa about three of the clock in the morning  reading baron marbot for she could not sleep  it proves she has a heart 
2072,suddenly elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus  in front of everybody 
2073,she took a seat on top 
2074,the impetuous creature  a pirate  started forward  sprang away  she had to hold the rail to steady herself  for a pirate it was  reckless  unscrupulous  bearing down ruthlessly  circumventing dangerously  boldly snatching a passenger  or ignoring a passenger  squeezing eel like and arrogant in between  and then rushing insolently all sails spread up whitehall 
2075,and did elizabeth give one thought to poor miss kilman who loved her without jealousy  to whom she had been a fawn in the open  a moon in a glade 
2076,she was delighted to be free 
2077,the fresh air was so delicious 
2078,it had been so stuffy in the army and navy stores 
2079,and now it was like riding  to be rushing up whitehall  and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn coloured coat responded freely like a rider  like the figure head of a ship  for the breeze slightly disarrayed her  the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood  and her fine eyes  having no eyes to meet  gazed ahead  blank  bright  with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture 
2080,it was always talking about her own sufferings that made miss kilman so difficult 
2081,and was she right 
2082,if it was being on committees and giving up hours and hours every day  she hardly ever saw him in london  that helped the poor  her father did that  goodness knows   if that was what miss kilman meant about being a christian  but it was so difficult to say 
2083,oh  she would like to go a little further 
2084,another penny was it to the strand 
2085,here was another penny then 
2086,she would go up the strand 
2087,she liked people who were ill 
2088,and every profession is open to the women of your generation  said miss kilman 
2089,so she might be a doctor 
2090,she might be a farmer 
2091,animals are often ill 
2092,she might own a thousand acres and have people under her 
2093,she would go and see them in their cottages 
2094,this was somerset house 
2095,one might be a very good farmer  and that  strangely enough though miss kilman had her share in it  was almost entirely due to somerset house 
2096,it looked so splendid  so serious  that great grey building 
2097,and she liked the feeling of people working 
2098,she liked those churches  like shapes of grey paper  breasting the stream of the strand 
2099,it was quite different here from westminster  she thought  getting off at chancery lane 
2100,it was so serious  it was so busy 
2101,in short  she would like to have a profession 
2102,she would become a doctor  a farmer  possibly go into parliament  if she found it necessary  all because of the strand 
2103,the feet of those people busy about their activities  hands putting stone to stone  minds eternally occupied not with trivial chatterings  comparing women to poplars  which was rather exciting  of course  but very silly   but with thoughts of ships  of business  of law  of administration  and with it all so stately  she was in the temple   gay  there was the river   pious  there was the church   made her quite determined  whatever her mother might say  to become either a farmer or a doctor 
2104,but she was  of course  rather lazy 
2105,and it was much better to say nothing about it 
2106,it seemed so silly 
2107,it was the sort of thing that did sometimes happen  when one was alone  buildings without architects  names  crowds of people coming back from the city having more power than single clergymen in kensington  than any of the books miss kilman had lent her  to stimulate what lay slumbrous  clumsy  and shy on the mind own sandy floor to break surface  as a child suddenly stretches its arms  it was just that  perhaps  a sigh  a stretch of the arms  an impulse  a revelation  which has its effects for ever  and then down again it went to the sandy floor  she must go home  she must dress for dinner  but what was the time   where was a clock 
2108,she looked up fleet street 
2109,she walked just a little way towards st  paul own  shyly  like some one penetrating on tiptoe  exploring a strange house by night with a candle  on edge lest the owner should suddenly fling wide his bedroom door and ask her business  nor did she dare wander off into queer alleys  tempting bye streets  any more than in a strange house open doors which might be bedroom doors  or sitting room doors  or lead straight to the larder 
2110,for no dalloways came down the strand daily  she was a pioneer  a stray  venturing  trusting 
2111,in many ways  her mother felt  she was extremely immature  like a child still  attached to dolls  to old slippers  a perfect baby  and that was charming 
2112,but then  of course  there was in the dalloway family the tradition of public service 
2113,abbesses  principals  head mistresses  dignitaries  in the republic of women  without being brilliant  any of them  they were that  she penetrated a little further in the direction of st  paul own  she liked the geniality  sisterhood  motherhood  brotherhood of this uproar  it seemed to her good  the noise was tremendous  and suddenly there were trumpets  the unemployed  blaring  rattling about in the uproar  military music  as if people were marching  yet had they been dying  had some woman breathed her last and whoever was watching  opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity  looked down on fleet street  that uproar  that military music would have come triumphing up to him  consolatory  indifferent 
2114,it was not conscious 
2115,there was no recognition in it of one fortune  or fate  and for that very reason even to those dazed with watching for the last shivers of consciousness on the faces of the dying  consoling 
2116,forgetfulness in people might wound  their ingratitude corrode  but this voice  pouring endlessly  year in year out  would take whatever it might be  this vow  this van  this life  this procession  would wrap them all about and carry them on  as in the rough stream of a glacier the ice holds a splinter of bone  a blue petal  some oak trees  and rolls them on 
2117,but it was later than she thought 
2118,her mother would not like her to be wandering off alone like this 
2119,she turned back down the strand 
2120,a puff of wind  in spite of the heat  there was quite a wind  blew a thin black veil over the sun and over the strand 
2121,the faces faded  the omnibuses suddenly lost their glow 
2122,for although the clouds were of mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off with a hatchet  with broad golden slopes  lawns of celestial pleasure gardens  on their flanks  and had all the appearance of settled habitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world  there was a perpetual movement among them 
2123,signs were interchanged  when  as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already  now a summit dwindled  now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage 
2124,fixed though they seemed at their posts  at rest in perfect unanimity  nothing could be fresher  freer  more sensitive superficially than the snow white or gold kindled surface  to change  to go  to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible  and in spite of the grave fixity  the accumulated robustness and solidity  now they struck light to the earth  now darkness 
2125,calmly and competently  elizabeth dalloway mounted the westminster omnibus 
2126,going and coming  beckoning  signalling  so the light and shadow which now made the wall grey  now the bananas bright yellow  now made the strand grey  now made the omnibuses bright yellow  seemed to septimus warren smith lying on the sofa in the sitting room  watching the watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of some live creature on the roses  on the wall paper 
2127,outside the trees dragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air  the sound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices of birds singing 
2128,every power poured its treasures on his head  and his hand lay there on the back of the sofa  as he had seen his hand lie when he was bathing  floating  on the top of the waves  while far away on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away 
2129,fear no more  says the heart in the body  fear no more 
2130,he was not afraid 
2131,at every moment nature signified by some laughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall  there  there  there  her determination to show  by brandishing her plumes  shaking her tresses  flinging her mantle this way and that  beautifully  always beautifully  and standing close up to breathe through her hollowed hands shakespeare own words  her meaning 
2132,rezia  sitting at the table twisting a hat in her hands  watched him  saw him smiling 
2133,he was happy then 
2134,but she could not bear to see him smiling 
2135,it was not marriage  it was not being one own husband to look strange like that  always to be starting  laughing  sitting hour after hour silent  or clutching her and telling her to write 
2136,the table drawer was full of those writings  about war  about shakespeare  about great discoveries  how there is no death 
2137,lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason  and both dr  holmes and sir william bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him   and waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth 
2138,he knew everything 
2139,that man  his friend who was killed  evans  had come  he said 
2140,he was singing behind the screen 
2141,she wrote it down just as he spoke it 
2142,some things were very beautiful  others sheer nonsense 
2143,and he was always stopping in the middle  changing his mind  wanting to add something  hearing something new  listening with his hand up 
2144,but she heard nothing 
2145,and once they found the girl who did the room reading one of these papers in fits of laughter 
2146,it was a dreadful pity 
2147,for that made septimus cry out about human cruelty  how they tear each other to pieces  the fallen  he said  they tear to pieces   holmes is on us   he would say  and he would invent stories about holmes  holmes eating porridge  holmes reading shakespeare  making himself roar with laughter or rage  for dr  holmes seemed to stand for something horrible to him 
2148, human nature   he called him 
2149,then there were the visions 
2150,he was drowned  he used to say  and lying on a cliff with the gulls screaming over him 
2151,he would look over the edge of the sofa down into the sea 
2152,or he was hearing music 
2153,really it was only a barrel organ or some man crying in the street 
2154,but  lovely   he used to cry  and the tears would run down his cheeks  which was to her the most dreadful thing of all  to see a man like septimus  who had fought  who was brave  crying 
2155,and he would lie listening until suddenly he would cry that he was falling down  down into the flames 
2156,actually she would look for flames  it was so vivid 
2157,but there was nothing 
2158,they were alone in the room 
2159,it was a dream  she would tell him and so quiet him at last  but sometimes she was frightened too 
2160,she sighed as she sat sewing 
2161,her sigh was tender and enchanting  like the wind outside a wood in the evening 
2162,now she put down her scissors  now she turned to take something from the table 
2163,a little stir  a little crinkling  a little tapping built up something on the table there  where she sat sewing 
2164,through his eyelashes he could see her blurred outline  her little black body  her face and hands  her turning movements at the table  as she took up a reel  or looked  she was apt to lose things  for her silk 
2165,she was making a hat for mrs  filmer own married daughter  whose name was  he had forgotten her name 
2166, what is the name of mrs  filmer own married daughter   he asked 
2167, mrs  peters   said rezia 
2168,she was afraid it was too small  she said  holding it before her 
2169,mrs  peters was a big woman  but she did not like her 
2170,it was only because mrs  filmer had been so good to them 
2171, she gave me grapes this morning   she said  that rezia wanted to do something to show that they were grateful 
2172,she had come into the room the other evening and found mrs  peters  who thought they were out  playing the gramophone 
2173, was it true   he asked 
2174,she was playing the gramophone 
2175,yes  she had told him about it at the time  she had found mrs  peters playing the gramophone 
2176,he began  very cautiously  to open his eyes  to see whether a gramophone was really there 
2177,but real things  real things were too exciting 
2178,he must be cautious 
2179,he would not go mad 
2180,first he looked at the fashion papers on the lower shelf  then  gradually at the gramophone with the green trumpet 
2181,nothing could be more exact 
2182,and so  gathering courage  he looked at the sideboard  the plate of bananas  the engraving of queen victoria and the prince consort  at the mantelpiece  with the jar of roses 
2183,none of these things moved 
2184,all were still  all were real 
2185, she is a woman with a spiteful tongue   said rezia 
2186, what does mr  peters do  
2187,septimus asked 
2188, ah   said rezia  trying to remember 
2189,she thought mrs  filmer had said that he travelled for some company 
2190, just now he is in hull   she said 
2191, just now  
2192,she said that with her italian accent 
2193,she said that herself 
2194,he shaded his eyes so that he might see only a little of her face at a time  first the chin  then the nose  then the forehead  in case it were deformed  or had some terrible mark on it 
2195,but no  there she was  perfectly natural  sewing  with the pursed lips that women have  the set  the melancholy expression  when sewing 
2196,but there was nothing terrible about it  he assured himself  looking a second time  a third time at her face  her hands  for what was frightening or disgusting in her as she sat there in broad daylight  sewing 
2197,mrs  peters had a spiteful tongue 
2198,mr  peters was in hull 
2199,why then rage and prophesy 
2200,why fly scourged and outcast 
2201,why be made to tremble and sob by the clouds 
2202,why seek truths and deliver messages when rezia sat sticking pins into the front of her dress  and mr  peters was in hull 
2203,miracles  revelations  agonies  loneliness  falling through the sea  down  down into the flames  all were burnt out  for he had a sense  as he watched rezia trimming the straw hat for mrs  peters  of a coverlet of flowers 
2204, it is too small for mrs  peters   said septimus 
2205,for the first time for days he was speaking as he used to do 
2206,of course it was  absurdly small  she said 
2207,but mrs  peters had chosen it 
2208,he took it out of her hands 
2209,he said it was an organ grinder own monkey own hat 
2210,how it rejoiced her that 
2211,not for weeks had they laughed like this together  poking fun privately like married people 
2212,what she meant was that if mrs  filmer had come in  or mrs  peters or anybody they would not have understood what she and septimus were laughing at 
2213, there   she said  pinning a rose to one side of the hat 
2214,never had she felt so happy 
2215,never in her life 
2216,but that was still more ridiculous  septimus said 
2217,now the poor woman looked like a pig at a fair 
2218, nobody ever made her laugh as septimus did  
2219,what had she got in her work box 
2220,she had ribbons and beads  tassels  artificial flowers 
2221,she tumbled them out on the table 
2222,he began putting odd colours together  for though he had no fingers  could not even do up a parcel  he had a wonderful eye  and often he was right  sometimes absurd  of course  but sometimes wonderfully right 
2223, she shall have a beautiful hat   he murmured  taking up this and that  rezia kneeling by his side  looking over his shoulder 
2224,now it was finished  that is to say the design  she must stitch it together 
2225,but she must be very  very careful  he said  to keep it just as he had made it 
2226,so she sewed 
2227,when she sewed  he thought  she made a sound like a kettle on the hob  bubbling  murmuring  always busy  her strong little pointed fingers pinching and poking  her needle flashing straight 
2228,the sun might go in and out  on the tassels  on the wall paper  but he would wait  he thought  stretching out his feet  looking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa  he would wait in this warm place  this pocket of still air  which one comes on at the edge of a wood sometimes in the evening  when  because of a fall in the ground  or some arrangement of the trees  one must be scientific above all  scientific   warmth lingers  and the air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird 
2229, there it is   said rezia  twirling mrs  peters  hat on the tips of her fingers 
2230, that will do for the moment  later        her sentence bubbled away drip  drip  drip  like a contented tap left running 
2231,it was wonderful 
2232,never had he done anything which made him feel so proud 
2233,it was so real  it was so substantial  mrs  peters  hat 
2234, just look at it   he said 
2235,yes  it would always make her happy to see that hat 
2236,he had become himself then  he had laughed then 
2237,they had been alone together 
2238,always she would like that hat 
2239,he told her to try it on 
2240, but i must look so queer   she cried  running over to the glass and looking first this side then that 
2241,then she snatched it off again  for there was a tap at the door 
2242,could it be sir william bradshaw 
2243,had he sent already 
2244,no  it was only the small girl with the evening paper 
2245,what always happened  then happened  what happened every night of their lives 
2246,the small girl sucked her thumb at the door  rezia went down on her knees  rezia cooed and kissed  rezia got a bag of sweets out of the table drawer 
2247,for so it always happened 
2248,first one thing  then another 
2249,so she built it up  first one thing and then another 
2250,dancing  skipping  round and round the room they went 
2251,he took the paper 
2252,surrey was all out  he read 
2253,there was a heat wave 
2254,rezia repeated  surrey was all out 
2255,there was a heat wave  making it part of the game she was playing with mrs  filmer own grandchild  both of them laughing  chattering at the same time  at their game 
2256,he was very tired 
2257,he was very happy 
2258,he would sleep 
2259,he shut his eyes 
2260,but directly he saw nothing the sounds of the game became fainter and stranger and sounded like the cries of people seeking and not finding  and passing further and further away 
2261,they had lost him 
2262,he started up in terror 
2263,what did he see 
2264,the plate of bananas on the sideboard 
2265,nobody was there  rezia had taken the child to its mother  it was bedtime  
2266,that was it  to be alone forever 
2267,that was the doom pronounced in milan when he came into the room and saw them cutting out buckram shapes with their scissors  to be alone forever 
2268,he was alone with the sideboard and the bananas 
2269,he was alone  exposed on this bleak eminence  stretched out  but not on a hill top  not on a crag  on mrs  filmer own sitting room sofa 
2270,as for the visions  the faces  the voices of the dead  where were they 
2271,there was a screen in front of him  with black bulrushes and blue swallows 
2272,where he had once seen mountains  where he had seen faces  where he had seen beauty  there was a screen 
2273, evans   he cried 
2274,there was no answer 
2275,a mouse had squeaked  or a curtain rustled 
2276,those were the voices of the dead 
2277,the screen  the coalscuttle  the sideboard remained to him 
2278,let him then face the screen  the coal scuttle and the sideboard       but rezia burst into the room chattering 
2279,some letter had come 
2280,everybody own plans were changed 
2281,mrs  filmer would not be able to go to brighton after all 
2282,there was no time to let mrs  williams know  and really rezia thought it very  very annoying  when she caught sight of the hat and thought       perhaps       she       might just make a little 
2283,      her voice died out in contented melody 
2284, ah  damn   she cried  it was a joke of theirs  her swearing   the needle had broken 
2285,hat  child  brighton  needle 
2286,she built it up  first one thing  then another  she built it up  sewing 
2287,she wanted him to say whether by moving the rose she had improved the hat 
2288,she sat on the end of the sofa 
2289,they were perfectly happy now  she said  suddenly  putting the hat down 
2290,for she could say anything to him now 
2291,she could say whatever came into her head 
2292,that was almost the first thing she had felt about him  that night in the caf when he had come in with his english friends 
2293,he had come in  rather shyly  looking round him  and his hat had fallen when he hung it up 
2294,that she could remember 
2295,she knew he was english  though not one of the large englishmen her sister admired  for he was always thin  but he had a beautiful fresh colour  and with his big nose  his bright eyes  his way of sitting a little hunched made her think  she had often told him  of a young hawk  that first evening she saw him  when they were playing dominoes  and he had come in  of a young hawk  but with her he was always very gentle  she had never seen him wild or drunk  only suffering sometimes through this terrible war  but even so  when she came in  he would put it all away  anything  anything in the whole world  any little bother with her work  anything that struck her to say she would tell him  and he understood at once  her own family even were not the same  being older than she was and being so clever  how serious he was  wanting her to read shakespeare before she could even read a child own story in english   being so much more experienced  he could help her 
2296,and she too could help him 
2297,but this hat now 
2298,and then  it was getting late  sir william bradshaw 
2299,she held her hands to her head  waiting for him to say did he like the hat or not  and as she sat there  waiting  looking down  he could feel her mind  like a bird  falling from branch to branch  and always alighting  quite rightly  he could follow her mind  as she sat there in one of those loose lax poses that came to her naturally and  if he should say anything  at once she smiled  like a bird alighting with all its claws firm upon the bough 
2300,but he remembered bradshaw said   the people we are most fond of are not good for us when we are ill  
2301,bradshaw said  he must be taught to rest 
2302,bradshaw said they must be separated 
2303, must    must   why  must  
2304,what power had bradshaw over him 
2305, what right has bradshaw to say  must  to me   he demanded 
2306, it is because you talked of killing yourself   said rezia 
2307, mercifully  she could now say anything to septimus  
2308,so he was in their power 
2309,holmes and bradshaw were on him 
2310,the brute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place 
2311, must  it could say 
2312,where were his papers 
2313,the things he had written 
2314,she brought him his papers  the things he had written  things she had written for him 
2315,she tumbled them out on to the sofa 
2316,they looked at them together 
2317,diagrams  designs  little men and women brandishing sticks for arms  with wings  were they   on their backs  circles traced round shillings and sixpences  the suns and stars  zigzagging precipices with mountaineers ascending roped together  exactly like knives and forks  sea pieces with little faces laughing out of what might perhaps be waves  the map of the world  burn them  he cried  now for his writings  how the dead sing behind rhododendron bushes  odes to time  conversations with shakespeare  evans  evans  evans  his messages from the dead  do not cut down trees  tell the prime minister 
2318,universal love  the meaning of the world 
2319,burn them  he cried 
2320,but rezia laid her hands on them 
2321,some were very beautiful  she thought 
2322,she would tie them up  for she had no envelope  with a piece of silk 
2323,even if they took him  she said  she would go with him 
2324,they could not separate them against their wills  she said 
2325,shuffling the edges straight  she did up the papers  and tied the parcel almost without looking  sitting beside him  he thought  as if all her petals were about her 
2326,she was a flowering tree  and through her branches looked out the face of a lawgiver  who had reached a sanctuary where she feared no one  not holmes  not bradshaw  a miracle  a triumph  the last and greatest 
2327,staggering he saw her mount the appalling staircase  laden with holmes and bradshaw  men who never weighed less than eleven stone six  who sent their wives to court  men who made ten thousand a year and talked of proportion  who different in their verdicts  for holmes said one thing  bradshaw another   yet judges they were  who mixed the vision and the sideboard  saw nothing clear  yet ruled  yet inflicted 
2328, must  they said 
2329,over them she triumphed 
2330, there   she said 
2331,the papers were tied up 
2332,no one should get at them 
2333,she would put them away 
2334,and  she said  nothing should separate them 
2335,she sat down beside him and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being malicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him 
2336,no one could separate them  she said 
2337,then she got up to go into the bedroom to pack their things  but hearing voices downstairs and thinking that dr  holmes had perhaps called  ran down to prevent him coming up 
2338,septimus could hear her talking to holmes on the staircase 
2339, my dear lady  i have come as a friend   holmes was saying 
2340, no  i will not allow you to see my husband   she said 
2341,he could see her  like a little hen  with her wings spread barring his passage 
2342,but holmes persevered 
2343, my dear lady  allow me       
2344,holmes said  putting her aside  holmes was a powerfully built man  
2345,holmes was coming upstairs 
2346,holmes would burst open the door 
2347,holmes would say  in a funk  eh  
2348,holmes would get him 
2349,but no  not holmes  not bradshaw 
2350,getting up rather unsteadily  hopping indeed from foot to foot  he considered mrs  filmer own nice clean bread knife with  bread  carved on the handle 
2351,ah  but one must not spoil that 
2352,the gas fire 
2353,but it was too late now 
2354,holmes was coming 
2355,razors he might have got  but rezia  who always did that sort of thing  had packed them 
2356,there remained only the window  the large bloomsbury lodging house window  the tiresome  the troublesome  and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out 
2357,it was their idea of tragedy  not his or rezia own  for she was with him  
2358,holmes and bradshaw like that sort of thing 
2359, he sat on the sill  
2360,but he would wait till the very last moment 
2361,he did not want to die 
2362,life was good 
2363,the sun hot 
2364,only human beings  what did they want 
2365,coming down the staircase opposite an old man stopped and stared at him 
2366,holmes was at the door 
2367, I will give it you   he cried  and flung himself vigorously  violently down on to mrs  filmer own area railings 
2368, the coward   cried dr  holmes  bursting the door open 
2369,rezia ran to the window  she saw  she understood 
2370,dr  holmes and mrs  filmer collided with each other 
2371,mrs  filmer flapped her apron and made her hide her eyes in the bedroom 
2372,there was a great deal of running up and down stairs 
2373,dr  holmes came in  white as a sheet  shaking all over  with a glass in his hand 
2374,she must be brave and drink something  he said  what was it  something sweet   for her husband was horribly mangled  would not recover consciousness  she must not see him  must be spared as much as possible  would have the inquest to go through  poor young woman 
2375,who could have foretold it 
2376,a sudden impulse  no one was in the least to blame  he told mrs  filmer  
2377,and why the devil he did it  dr  holmes could not conceive 
2378,it seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening long windows  stepping out into some garden 
2379,but where 
2380,the clock was striking  one  two  three  how sensible the sound was  compared with all this thumping and whispering  like septimus himself 
2381,she was falling asleep 
2382,but the clock went on striking  four  five  six and mrs  filmer waving her apron  they would not bring the body in here  would they   seemed part of that garden  or a flag 
2383,she had once seen a flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt at venice 
2384,men killed in battle were thus saluted  and septimus had been through the war 
2385,of her memories  most were happy 
2386,she put on her hat  and ran through cornfields  where could it have been   on to some hill  somewhere near the sea  for there were ships  gulls  butterflies  they sat on a cliff 
2387,in london too  there they sat  and  half dreaming  came to her through the bedroom door  rain falling  whisperings  stirrings among dry corn  the caress of the sea  as it seemed to her  hollowing them in its arched she will and murmuring to her laid on shore  strewn she felt  like flying flowers over some tomb 
2388, he is dead   she said  smiling at the poor old woman who guarded her with her honest light blue eyes fixed on the door 
2389, they would not bring him in here  would they  
2390,but mrs  filmer pooh poohed 
2391,oh no  oh no 
2392,they were carrying him away now 
2393,ought she not to be told 
2394,married people ought to be together  mrs  filmer thought 
2395,but they must do as the doctor said 
2396, let her sleep   said dr  holmes  feeling her pulse 
2397,she saw the large outline of his body standing dark against the window 
2398,so that was dr  holmes 
2399,one of the triumphs of civilisation  peter walsh thought 
2400,it is one of the triumphs of civilisation  as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded 
2401,swiftly  cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital  having picked up instantly  humanely  some poor devil  some one hit on the head  struck down by disease  knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings  as might happen to oneself 
2402,that was civilisation 
2403,it struck him coming back from the east  the efficiency  the organisation  the communal spirit of london  every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass  perhaps it was morbid  or was it not touching rather  the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside  busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife  or presumably how easily it might have been them there  stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse 
2404,      ah  but thinking became morbid  sentimental  directly one began conjuring up doctors  dead bodies  a little glow of pleasure  a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more  fatal to art  fatal to friendship  true  and yet  thought peter walsh  as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the tottenham court road  chiming constantly  it is the privilege of loneliness  in privacy one may do as one chooses  one might weep if no one saw  it had been his undoing  this susceptibility  in anglo indian society  not weeping at the right time  or laughing either 
2405,i have that in me  he thought standing by the pillar box  which could now dissolve in tears 
2406,why  heaven knows 
2407,beauty of some sort probably  and the weight of the day  which beginning with that visit to clarissa had exhausted him with its heat  its intensity  and the drip  drip  of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood  deep  dark  and no one would ever know 
2408,partly for that reason  its secrecy  complete and inviolable  he had found life like an unknown garden  full of turns and corners  surprising  yes  really it took one own breath away  these moments  there coming to him by the pillar box opposite the british museum one of them  a moment  in which things came together  this ambulance  and life and death 
2409,it was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him  like a white she will sprinkled beach  left bare 
2410,it had been his undoing in anglo indian society  this susceptibility 
2411,clarissa once  going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere  clarissa superficially at least  so easily moved  now in despair  now in the best of spirits  all aquiver in those days and such good company  spotting queer little scenes  names  people from the top of a bus  for they used to explore london and bring back bags full of treasures from the caledonian market  clarissa had a theory in those days  they had heaps of theories  always theories  as young people have 
2412,it was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction  not knowing people  not being known 
2413,for how could they know each other 
2414,you met every day  then not for six months  or years 
2415,it was unsatisfactory  they agreed  how little one knew people 
2416,but she said  sitting on the bus going up shaftesbury avenue  she felt herself everywhere  not  here  here  here   and she tapped the back of the seat  but everywhere 
2417,she waved her hand  going up shaftesbury avenue 
2418,she was all that 
2419,so that to know her  or any one  one must seek out the people who completed them  even the places 
2420,odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to  some woman in the street  some man behind a counter  even trees  or barns  it ended in a transcendental theory which  with her horror of death  allowed her to believe  or say that she believed  for all her scepticism   that since our apparitions  the part of us which appears  are so momentary compared with the other  the unseen part of us  which spreads wide  the unseen might survive  be recovered somehow attached to this person or that  or even haunting certain places after death       perhaps  perhaps 
2421,looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent 
2422,brief  broken  often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions  this morning  for instance  in came elizabeth  like a long legged colt  handsome  dumb  just as he was beginning to talk to clarissa  the effect of them on his life was immeasurable 
2423,there was a mystery about it 
2424,you were given a sharp  acute  uncomfortable grain  the actual meeting  horribly painful as often as not  yet in absence  in the most unlikely places  it would flower out  open  she would its scent  let you touch  taste  look about you  get the whole feel of it and understanding  after years of lying lost 
2425,thus she had come to him  on board ship  in the himalayas  suggested by the oddest things  so sally seton  generous  enthusiastic goose  thought of him when she saw blue hydrangeas  
2426,she had influenced him more than any person he had ever known 
2427,and always in this way coming before him without his wishing it  cool  lady like  critical  or ravishing  romantic  recalling some field or english harvest 
2428,he saw her most often in the country  not in london 
2429,one scene after another at bourton       
2430,he had reached his hotel 
2431,he crossed the hall  with its mounds of reddish chairs and sofas  its spike leaved  withered looking plants 
2432,he got his key off the hook 
2433,the young lady handed him some letters 
2434,he went upstairs  he saw her most often at bourton  in the late summer  when he stayed there for a week  or fortnight even  as people did in those days  first on top of some hill there she would stand  hands clapped to her hair  her cloak blowing out  pointing  crying to them  she saw the severn beneath 
2435,or in a wood  making the kettle boil  very ineffective with her fingers  the smoke curtseying  blowing in their faces  her little pink face showing through  begging water from an old woman in a cottage  who came to the door to watch them go 
2436,they walked always  the others drove 
2437,she was bored driving  disliked all animals  except that dog 
2438,they tramped miles along roads 
2439,she would break off to get her bearings  pilot him back across country  and all the time they argued  discussed poetry  discussed people  discussed politics  she was a radical then   never noticing a thing except when she stopped  cried out at a view or a tree  and made him look with her  and so on again  through stubble fields  she walking ahead  with a flower for her aunt  never tired of walking for all her delicacy  to drop down on bourton in the dusk 
2440,then  after dinner  old breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice  and they would lie sunk in arm chairs  trying not to laugh  but always breaking down and laughing  laughing  laughing at nothing 
2441,breitkopf was supposed not to see 
2442,and then in the morning  flirting up and down like a wagtail in front of the house       
2443,oh it was a letter from her 
2444,this blue envelope  that was her hand 
2445,and he would have to read it 
2446,here was another of those meetings  bound to be painful 
2447,to read her letter needed the devil of an effort 
2448, how heavenly it was to see him  she must tell him that  
2449,that was all 
2450,but it upset him 
2451,it annoyed him 
2452,he wished she had not written it 
2453,coming on top of his thoughts  it was like a nudge in the ribs 
2454,why could not she let him be 
2455,after all  she had married dalloway  and lived with him in perfect happiness all these years 
2456,these hotels are not consoling places 
2457,far from it 
2458,any number of people had hung up their hats on those pegs 
2459,even the flies  if you thought of it  had settled on other people own noses 
2460,as for the cleanliness which hit him in the face  it was not cleanliness  so much as bareness  frigidity  a thing that had to be 
2461,some arid matron made her rounds at dawn sniffing  peering  causing blue nosed maids to scour  for all the world as if the next visitor were a joint of meat to be served on a perfectly clean platter 
2462,for sleep  one bed  for sitting in  one armchair  for cleaning one own teeth and shaving one own chin  one tumbler  one looking glass 
2463,books  letters  dressing gown  slipped about on the impersonality of the horsehair like incongruous impertinences 
2464,and it was clarissa own letter that made him see all this 
2465, heavenly to see you  she must say so  
2466,he folded the paper  pushed it away  nothing would induce him to read it again 
2467,to get that letter to him by six of the clock she must have sat down and written it directly he left her  stamped it  sent somebody to the post 
2468,it was  as people say  very like her 
2469,she was upset by his visit 
2470,she had felt a great deal  had for a moment  when she kissed his hand  regretted  envied him even  remembered possibly  for he saw her look it  something he had said  how they would change the world if she married him perhaps  whereas  it was this  it was middle age  it was mediocrity  then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside  there being in her a thread of life which for toughness  endurance  power to overcome obstacles  and carry her triumphantly through he had never known the like of 
2471,yes  but there would come a reaction directly he left the room 
2472,she would be frightfully sorry for him  she would think what in the world she could do to give him pleasure  short always of the one thing  and he could see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her writing table and dashing off that one line which he was to find greeting him         heavenly to see you  
2473,and she meant it 
2474,peter walsh had now unlaced his boots 
2475,but it would not have been a success  their marriage 
2476,the other thing  after all  came so much more naturally 
2477,it was odd  it was true  lots of people felt it 
2478,peter walsh  who had done just respectably  filled the usual posts adequately  was liked  but thought a little cranky  gave himself airs  it was odd that he should have had  especially now that his hair was grey  a contented look  a look of having reserves  it was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly  there was something unusual about him  or something behind him  it might be that he was bookish  never came to see you without taking up the book on the table  he was now reading  with his bootlaces trailing on the floor   or that he was a gentleman  which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe  and in his manners of course to women 
2479,for it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger 
2480,but at her own risk 
2481,that is to say  though he might be ever so easy  and indeed with his gaiety and good breeding fascinating to be with  it was only up to a point 
2482,she said something  no  no  he saw through that  he would not stand that  no  no 
2483,then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men 
2484,he was the best judge of cooking in india 
2485,he was a man 
2486,but not the sort of man one had to respect  which was a mercy  not like major simmons  for instance  not in the least like that  daisy thought  when  in spite of her two small children  she used to compare them 
2487,he pulled off his boots 
2488,he emptied his pockets 
2489,out came with his pocket knife a snapshot of daisy on the verandah  daisy all in white  with a fox terrier on her knee  very charming  very dark  the best he had ever seen of her 
2490,it did come  after all so naturally  so much more naturally than clarissa 
2491,no fuss 
2492,no bother 
2493,no finicking and fidgeting 
2494,all plain sailing 
2495,and the dark  adorably pretty girl on the verandah exclaimed  he could hear her  
2496,of course  of course she would give him everything  she cried  she had no sense of discretion  everything he wanted  she cried  running to meet him  whoever might be looking 
2497,and she was only twenty four 
2498,and she had two children 
2499,well  well 
2500,well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age 
2501,and it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly 
2502,suppose they did marry 
2503,for him it would be all very well  but what about her 
2504,mrs  burgess  a good sort and no chatterbox  in whom he had confided  thought this absence of his in england  ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make daisy reconsider  think what it meant 
2505,it was a question of her position  mrs  burgess said  the social barrier  giving up her children 
2506,she would be a widow with a past one of these days  draggling about in the suburbs  or more likely  indiscriminate  you know  she said  what such women get like  with too much paint  
2507,but peter walsh pooh poohed all that 
2508,he did not mean to die yet 
2509,anyhow she must settle for herself  judge for herself  he thought  padding about the room in his socks  smoothing out his dress shirt  for he might go to clarissa own party  or he might go to one of the halls  or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at oxford 
2510,and if he did retire  that is what he would do  write books  he would go to oxford and poke about in the bodleian  vainly the dark  adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the terrace  vainly waved her hand  vainly cried she did not care a straw what people said  there he was  the man she thought the world of  the perfect gentleman  the fascinating  the distinguished  and his age made not the least difference to her   padding about a room in an hotel in bloomsbury  shaving  washing  continuing  as he took up cans  put down razors  to poke about in the bodleian  and get at the truth about one or two little matters that interested him  and he would have a chat with whoever it might be  and so come to disregard more and more precise hours for lunch  and miss engagements  and when daisy asked him  as she would  for a kiss  a scene  fail to come up to the scratch  though he was genuinely devoted to her   in short it might be happier  as mrs  burgess said  that she should forget him  or merely remember him as he was in august   like a figure standing at the cross roads at dusk  which grows more and more remote as the dog cart spins away  carrying her securely fastened to the back seat  though her arms are outstretched  and as she sees the figure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do anything in the world  anything  anything  anything       
2511,he never knew what people thought 
2512,it became more and more difficult for him to concentrate 
2513,he became absorbed  he became busied with his own concerns  now surly  now gay  dependent on women  absent minded  moody  less and less able  so he thought as he shaved  to understand why clarissa could not simply find them a lodging and be nice to daisy  introduce her 
2514,and then he could just  just do what 
2515,just haunt and hover  he was at the moment actually engaged in sorting out various keys  papers   swoop and taste  be alone  in short  sufficient to himself  and yet nobody of course was more dependent upon others  he buttoned his waistcoat   it had been his undoing 
2516,he could not keep out of smoking rooms  liked colonels  liked golf  liked bridge  and above all women own society  and the fineness of their companionship  and their faithfulness and audacity and greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to him  and the dark  adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes  so wholly admirable  so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of human life  and yet he could not come up to the scratch  being always apt to see round things  clarissa had sapped something in him permanently   and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want variety in love  though it would make him furious if daisy loved anybody else  furious  for he was jealous  uncontrollably jealous by temperament 
2517,he suffered tortures 
2518,but where was his knife  his watch  his seals  his note case  and clarissa own letter which he would not read again but liked to think of  and daisy own photograph 
2519,and now for dinner 
2520,they were eating 
2521,sitting at little tables round vases  dressed or not dressed  with their shawls and bags laid beside them  with their air of false composure  for they were not used to so many courses at dinner  and confidence  for they were able to pay for it  and strain  for they had been running about london all day shopping  sightseeing  and their natural curiosity  for they looked round and up as the nice looking gentleman in horn rimmed spectacles came in  and their good nature  for they would have been glad to do any little service  such as lend a time table or impart useful information  and their desire  pulsing in them  tugging at them subterraneously  somehow to establish connections if it were only a birthplace  liverpool  for example  in common or friends of the same name  with their furtive glances  odd silences  and sudden withdrawals into family jocularity and isolation  there they sat eating dinner when mr  walsh came in and took his seat at a little table by the curtain 
2522,it was not that he said anything  for being solitary he could only address himself to the waiter  it was his way of looking at the menu  of pointing his forefinger to a particular wine  of hitching himself up to the table  of addressing himself seriously  not gluttonously to dinner  that won him their respect  which  having to remain unexpressed for the greater part of the meal  flared up at the table where the morrises sat when mr  walsh was heard to say at the end of the meal   bartlett pears  
2523,why he should have spoken so moderately yet firmly  with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights which are founded upon justice  neither young charles morris  nor old charles  neither miss elaine nor mrs  morris knew 
2524,but when he said   bartlett pears   sitting alone at his table  they felt that he counted on their support in some lawful demand  was champion of a because which immediately became their own  so that their eyes met his eyes sympathetically  and when they all reached the smoking room simultaneously  a little talk between them became inevitable 
2525,it was not very profound  only to the effect that london was crowded  had changed in thirty years  that mr  morris preferred liverpool  that mrs  morris had been to the westminster flower show  and that they had all seen the prince of wales 
2526,yet  thought peter walsh  no family in the world can compare with the morrises  none whatever  and their relations to each other are perfect  and they do not care a hang for the upper classes  and they like what they like  and elaine is training for the family business  and the boy has won a scholarship at leeds  and the old lady  who is about his own age  has three more children at home  and they have two motor cars  but mr  morris still mends the boots on sunday  it is superb  it is absolutely superb  thought peter walsh  swaying a little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand among the hairy red chairs and ash trays  feeling very well pleased with himself  for the morrises liked him 
2527,yes  they liked a man who said   bartlett pears  
2528,they liked him  he felt 
2529,he would go to clarissa own party 
2530, the morrises moved off  but they would meet again  
2531,he would go to clarissa own party  because he wanted to ask richard what they were doing in india  the conservative duffers 
2532,and what is being acted 
2533,and music 
2534,      oh yes  and mere gossip 
2535,for this is the truth about our soul  he thought  our self  who fish like inhabits deep seas and plies among obscurities threading her way between the boles of giant weeds  over sun flickered spaces and on and on into gloom  cold  deep  inscrutable  suddenly she shoots to the surface and sports on the wind wrinkled waves  that is  has a positive need to brush  scrape  kindle herself  gossiping 
2536,what did the government mean  richard dalloway would know  to do about india 
2537,since it was a very hot night and the paper boys went by with placards proclaiming in huge red letters that there was a heat wave  wicker chairs were placed on the hotel steps and there  sipping  smoking  detached gentlemen sat 
2538,peter walsh sat there 
2539,one might fancy that day  the london day  was just beginning 
2540,like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls  the day changed  put off stuff  took gauze  changed to evening  and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes  tumbling petticoats on the floor  it too she would dust  heat  colour  the traffic thinned  motor cars  tinkling  darting  succeeded the lumber of vans  and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung 
2541,i resign  the evening seemed to say  as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences  moulded  pointed  of hotel  flat  and block of shops  i fade  she was beginning  i disappear  but london would have none of it  and rushed her bayonets into the sky  pinioned her  constrained her to partnership in her revelry 
2542,for the great revolution of mr  willett own summer time had taken place since peter walsh own last visit to england 
2543,the prolonged evening was new to him 
2544,it was inspiriting  rather 
2545,for as the young people went by with their despatch boxes  awfully glad to be free  proud too  dumbly  of stepping this famous pavement  joy of a kind  cheap  tinselly  if you like  but all the same rapture  flushed their faces 
2546,they dressed well too  pink stockings  pretty shoes 
2547,they would now have two hours at the pictures 
2548,it sharpened  it refined them  the yellow blue evening light  and on the leaves in the square shone lurid  livid  they looked as if dipped in sea water  the foliage of a submerged city 
2549,he was astonished by the beauty  it was encouraging too  for where the returned anglo indian sat by rights  he knew crowds of them  in the oriental club biliously summing up the ruin of the world  here was he  as young as ever  envying young people their summer time and the rest of it  and more than suspecting from the words of a girl  from a housemaid own laughter  intangible things you could not lay your hands on  that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable 
2550,on top of them it had pressed  weighed them down  the women especially  like those flowers clarissa own aunt helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting paper with littr  own dictionary on top  sitting under the lamp after dinner 
2551,she was dead now 
2552,he had heard of her  from clarissa  losing the sight of one eye 
2553,it seemed so fitting  one of nature own masterpieces  that old miss parry should turn to glass 
2554,she would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch 
2555,she belonged to a different age  but being so entire  so complete  would always stand up on the horizon  stone white  eminent  like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous  long  long voyage  this interminable  he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about surrey and yorkshire  he had held out that copper millions of times  surrey was all out once more   this interminable life 
2556,but cricket was no mere game 
2557,cricket was important 
2558,he could never help reading about cricket 
2559,he read the scores in the stop press first  then how it was a hot day  then about a murder case 
2560,having done things millions of times enriched them  though it might be said to take the surface off 
2561,the past enriched  and experience  and having cared for one or two people  and so having acquired the power which the young lack  of cutting short  doing what one likes  not caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any very great expectations  he left his paper on the table and moved off   which however  and he looked for his hat and coat  was not altogether true of him  not to night  for here he was starting to go to a party  at his age  with the belief upon him that he was about to have an experience 
2562,but what 
2563,beauty anyhow 
2564,not the crude beauty of the eye 
2565,it was not beauty pure and simple  bedford place leading into russell square 
2566,it was straightness and emptiness of course  the symmetry of a corridor  but it was also windows lit up  a piano  a gramophone sounding  a sense of pleasure making hidden  but now and again emerging when  through the uncurtained window  the window left open  one saw parties sitting over tables  young people slowly circling  conversations between men and women  maids idly looking out  a strange comment theirs  when work was done   stockings drying on top ledges  a parrot  a few plants 
2567,absorbing  mysterious  of infinite richness  this life 
2568,and in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick  there were loitering couples  dallying  embracing  shrunk up under the shower of a tree  that was moving  so silent  so absorbed  that one passed  discreetly  timidly  as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious 
2569,that was interesting 
2570,and so on into the flare and glare 
2571,his light overcoat blew open  he stepped with indescribable idiosyncrasy  lent a little forward  tripped  with his hands behind his back and his eyes still a little hawklike  he tripped through london  towards westminster  observing 
2572,was everybody dining out  then 
2573,doors were being opened here by a footman to let issue a high stepping old dame  in buckled shoes  with three purple ostrich feathers in her hair 
2574,doors were being opened for ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on them  ladies with bare heads 
2575,and in respectable quarters with stucco pillars through small front gardens lightly swathed with combs in their hair  having run up to see the children   women came  men waited for them  with their coats blowing open  and the motor started 
2576,everybody was going out 
2577,what with these doors being opened  and the descent and the start  it seemed as if the whole of london were embarking in little boats moored to the bank  tossing on the waters  as if the whole place were floating off in carnival 
2578,and whitehall was skated over  silver beaten as it was  skated over by spiders  and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps  it was so hot that people stood about talking 
2579,and here in westminster was a retired judge  presumably  sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white 
2580,an anglo indian presumably 
2581,and here a shindy of brawling women  drunken women  here only a policeman and looming houses  high houses  domed houses  churches  parliaments  and the hoot of a steamer on the river  a hollow misty cry 
2582,but it was her street  this  clarissa own  cabs were rushing round the corner  like water round the piers of a bridge  drawn together  it seemed to him because they bore people going to her party  clarissa own party 
2583,the cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded 
2584,the brain must wake now 
2585,the body must contract now  entering the house  the lighted house  where the door stood open  where the motor cars were standing  and bright women descending  the soul must brave itself to endure 
2586,he opened the big blade of his pocket knife 
2587,lucy came running full tilt downstairs  having just nipped in to the drawing room to smooth a cover  to straighten a chair  to pause a moment and feel whoever came in must think how clean  how bright  how beautifully cared for  when they saw the beautiful silver  the brass fire irons  the new chair covers  and the curtains of yellow chintz  she appraised each  heard a roar of voices  people already coming up from dinner  she must fly 
2588,the prime minister was coming  agnes said  so she had heard them say in the dining room  she said  coming in with a tray of glasses 
2589,did it matter  did it matter in the least  one prime minister more or less 
2590,it made no difference at this hour of the night to mrs  walker among the plates  saucepans  cullenders  frying pans  chicken in aspic  ice cream freezers  pared crusts of bread  lemons  soup tureens  and pudding basins which  however hard they washed up in the scullery seemed to be all on top of her  on the kitchen table  on chairs  while the fire blared and roared  the electric lights glared  and still supper had to be laid 
2591,all she felt was  one prime minister more or less made not a scrap of difference to mrs  walker 
2592,the ladies were going upstairs already  said lucy  the ladies were going up  one by one  mrs  dalloway walking last and almost always sending back some message to the kitchen   my love to mrs  walker   that was it one night 
2593,next morning they would go over the dishes  the soup  the salmon  the salmon  mrs  walker knew  as usual underdone  for she always got nervous about the pudding and left it to jenny  so it happened  the salmon was always underdone 
2594,but some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said  lucy said  about the entr e  was it really made at home 
2595,but it was the salmon that bothered mrs  walker  as she spun the plates round and round  and pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers  and there came a burst of laughter from the dining room  a voice speaking  then another burst of laughter  the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone 
2596,the tokay  said lucy running in 
2597,mr  dalloway had sent for the tokay  from the emperor own cellars  the imperial tokay 
2598,it was borne through the kitchen 
2599,over her shoulder lucy reported how miss elizabeth looked quite lovely  she could not take her eyes off her  in her pink dress  wearing the necklace mr  dalloway had given her 
2600,jenny must remember the dog  miss elizabeth own fox terrier  which  since it bit  had to be shut up and might  elizabeth thought  want something 
2601,jenny must remember the dog 
2602,but jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about 
2603,there was a motor at the door already 
2604,there was a ring at the bell  and the gentlemen still in the dining room  drinking tokay 
2605,there  they were going upstairs  that was the first to come  and now they would come faster and faster  so that mrs  parkinson  hired for parties  would leave the hall door ajar  and the hall would be full of gentlemen waiting  they stood waiting  sleeking down their hair  while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the passage  where mrs  barnet helped them  old ellen barnet  who had been with the family for forty years  and came every summer to help the ladies  and remembered mothers when they were girls  and though very unassuming did shake hands  said  milady  very respectfully  yet had a humorous way with her  looking at the young ladies  and ever so tactfully helping lady lovejoy  who had some trouble with her underbodice 
2606,and they could not help feeling  lady lovejoy and miss alice  that some little privilege in the matter of brush and comb  was awarded them having known mrs  barnet   thirty years  milady   mrs  barnet supplied her 
2607,young ladies did not use to rouge  said lady lovejoy  when they stayed at bourton in the old days 
2608,and miss alice did not need rouge  said mrs  barnet  looking at her fondly 
2609,there mrs  barnet would sit  in the cloakroom  patting down the furs  smoothing out the spanish shawls  tidying the dressing table  and knowing perfectly well  in spite of the furs and the embroideries  which were nice ladies  which were not 
2610,the dear old body  said lady lovejoy  mounting the stairs  clarissa own old nurse 
2611,and then lady lovejoy stiffened 
2612, lady and miss lovejoy   she said to mr  wilkins  hired for parties  
2613,he had an admirable manner  as he bent and straightened himself  bent and straightened himself and announced with perfect impartiality  lady and miss lovejoy       sir john and lady needham       miss weld       mr  walsh  
2614,his manner was admirable  his family life must be irreproachable  except that it seemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks could ever have blundered into the nuisance of children 
2615, how delightful to see you   said clarissa 
2616,she said it to every one 
2617,how delightful to see you 
2618,she was at her worst  effusive  insincere 
2619,it was a great mistake to have come 
2620,he should have stayed at home and read his book  thought peter walsh  should have gone to a music hall  he should have stayed at home  for he knew no one 
2621,oh dear  it was going to be a failure  a complete failure  clarissa felt it in her bones as dear old lord lexham stood there apologising for his wife who had caught cold at the buckingham palace garden party 
2622,she could see peter out of the tail of her eye  criticising her  there  in that corner 
2623,why  after all  did she do these things 
2624,why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire 
2625,might it consume her anyhow 
2626,burn her to cinders 
2627,better anything  better brandish one own torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some ellie henderson 
2628,it was extraordinary how peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner 
2629,he made her see herself  exaggerate 
2630,it was idiotic 
2631,but why did he come  then  merely to criticise 
2632,why always take  never give 
2633,why not risk one own one little point of view 
2634,there he was wandering off  and she must speak to him 
2635,but she would not get the chance 
2636,life was that  humiliation  renunciation  what lord lexham was saying was that his wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because  my dear  you ladies are all alike   lady lexham being seventy five at least 
2637,it was delicious  how they petted each other  that old couple 
2638,she did like old lord lexham 
2639,she did think it mattered  her party  and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong  all falling flat 
2640,anything  any explosion  any horror was better than people wandering aimlessly  standing in a bunch at a corner like ellie henderson  not even caring to hold themselves upright 
2641,gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of paradise blew out and it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room  right out  then sucked back 
2642, for the windows were open  
2643,was it draughty  ellie henderson wondered 
2644,she was subject to chills 
2645,but it did not matter that she should come down sneezing to morrow  it was the girls with their naked shoulders she thought of  being trained to think of others by an old father  an invalid  late vicar of bourton  but he was dead now  and her chills never went to her chest  never 
2646,it was the girls she thought of  the young girls with their bare shoulders  she herself having always been a wisp of a creature  with her thin hair and meagre profile  though now  past fifty  there was beginning to shine through some mild beam  something purified into distinction by years of self abnegation but obscured again  perpetually  by her distressing gentility  her panic fear  which arose from three hundred pounds  income  and her weaponless state  she could not earn a penny  and it made her timid  and more and more disqualified year by year to meet well dressed people who did this sort of thing every night of the season  merely telling their maids  I will wear so and so   whereas ellie henderson ran out nervously and bought cheap pink flowers  half a dozen  and then threw a shawl over her old black dress 
2647,for her invitation to clarissa own party had come at the last moment 
2648,she was not quite happy about it 
2649,she had a sort of feeling that clarissa had not meant to ask her this year 
2650,why should she 
2651,there was no reason really  except that they had always known each other 
2652,indeed  they were cousins 
2653,but naturally they had rather drifted apart  clarissa being so sought after 
2654,it was an event to her  going to a party 
2655,it was quite a treat just to see the lovely clothes 
2656,was not that elizabeth  grown up  with her hair done in the fashionable way  in the pink dress 
2657,yet she could not be more than seventeen 
2658,she was very  very handsome 
2659,but girls when they first came out did not seem to wear white as they used 
2660, she must remember everything to tell edith  
2661,girls wore straight frocks  perfectly tight  with skirts well above the ankles 
2662,it was not becoming  she thought 
2663,so  with her weak eyesight  ellie henderson craned rather forward  and it was not so much she who minded not having any one to talk to  she hardly knew anybody there   for she felt that they were all such interesting people to watch  politicians presumably  richard dalloway own friends  but it was richard himself who felt that he could not let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by herself 
2664, well  ellie  and how is the world treating you   he said in his genial way  and ellie henderson  getting nervous and flushing and feeling that it was extraordinarily nice of him to come and talk to her  said that many people really felt the heat more than the cold 
2665, yes  they do   said richard dalloway 
2666, yes  
2667,but what more did one say 
2668, hullo  richard   said somebody  taking him by the elbow  and  good lord  there was old peter  old peter walsh 
2669,he was delighted to see him  ever so pleased to see him 
2670,he had not changed a bit 
2671,and off they went together walking right across the room  giving each other little pats  as if they had not met for a long time  ellie henderson thought  watching them go  certain she knew that man own face 
2672,a tall man  middle aged  rather fine eyes  dark  wearing spectacles  with a look of john burrows 
2673,edith would be sure to know 
2674,the curtain with its flight of birds of paradise blew out again 
2675,and clarissa saw  she saw ralph lyon beat it back  and go on talking  so it was not a failure after all  it was going to be all right now  her party 
2676,it had begun 
2677,it had started 
2678,but it was still touch and go 
2679,she must stand there for the present 
2680,people seemed to come in a rush 
2681,colonel and mrs  garrod       mr  hugh whitbread       mr  bowley       mrs  hilbery       lady mary maddox       mr  quin       intoned wilkin 
2682,she had six or seven words with each  and they went on  they went into the rooms  into something now  not nothing  since ralph lyon had beat back the curtain 
2683,and yet for her own part  it was too much of an effort 
2684,she was not enjoying it 
2685,it was too much like being  just anybody  standing there  anybody could do it  yet this anybody she did a little admire  could not help feeling that she had  anyhow  made this happen  that it marked a stage  this post that she felt herself to have become  for oddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like  but felt herself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs 
2686,every time she gave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself  and that every one was unreal in one way  much more real in another 
2687,it was  she thought  partly their clothes  partly being taken out of their ordinary ways  partly the background  it was possible to say things you could not say anyhow else  things that needed an effort  possible to go much deeper 
2688,but not for her  not yet anyhow 
2689, how delightful to see you   she said 
2690,dear old sir harry 
2691,he would know every one 
2692,and what was so odd about it was the sense one had as they came up the stairs one after another  mrs  mount and celia  herbert ainsty  mrs  dakers  oh and lady bruton 
2693, how awfully good of you to come   she said  and she meant it  it was odd how standing there one felt them going on  going on  some quite old  some
2694,what name 
2695,lady rosseter 
2696,but who on earth was lady rosseter 
2697, clarissa  
2698,that voice 
2699,it was sally seton 
2700,sally seton  after all these years 
2701,she loomed through a mist 
2702,for she had not looked like that  sally seton  when clarissa grasped the hot water can  to think of her under this roof  under this roof 
2703,not like that 
2704,all on top of each other  embarrassed  laughing  words tumbled out  passing through london  heard from clara haydon  what a chance of seeing you  so i thrust myself in  without an invitation       
2705,one might put down the hot water can quite composedly 
2706,the lustre had gone out of her 
2707,yet it was extraordinary to see her again  older  happier  less lovely 
2708,they kissed each other  first this cheek then that  by the drawing room door  and clarissa turned  with sally own hand in hers  and saw her rooms full  heard the roar of voices  saw the candlesticks  the blowing curtains  and the roses which richard had given her 
2709, i have five enormous boys   said sally 
2710,she had the simplest egotism  the most open desire to be thought first always  and clarissa loved her for being still like that 
2711, i cannot believe it   she cried  kindling all over with pleasure at the thought of the past 
2712,but alas  wilkins  wilkins wanted her  wilkins was emitting in a voice of commanding authority as if the whole company must be admonished and the hostess reclaimed from frivolity  one name 
2713, the prime minister   said peter walsh 
2714,the prime minister 
2715,was it really 
2716,ellie henderson marvelled 
2717,what a thing to tell edith 
2718,one could not laugh at him 
2719,he looked so ordinary 
2720,you might have stood him behind a counter and bought biscuits  poor chap  all rigged up in gold lace 
2721,and to be fair  as he went his rounds  first with clarissa then with richard escorting him  he did it very well 
2722,he tried to look somebody 
2723,it was amusing to watch 
2724,nobody looked at him 
2725,they just went on talking  yet it was perfectly plain that they all knew  felt to the marrow of their bones  this majesty passing  this symbol of what they all stood for  english society 
2726,old lady bruton  and she looked very fine too  very stalwart in her lace  swam up  and they withdrew into a little room which at once became spied upon  guarded  and a sort of stir and rustle rippled through every one  openly  the prime minister 
2727,lord  lord  the snobbery of the english  thought peter walsh  standing in the corner 
2728,how they loved dressing up in gold lace and doing homage 
2729,there 
2730,that must be  by jove it was  hugh whitbread  snuffing round the precincts of the great  grown rather fatter  rather whiter  the admirable hugh 
2731,he looked always as if he were on duty  thought peter  a privileged  but secretive being  hoarding secrets which he would die to defend  though it was only some little piece of tittle tattle dropped by a court footman  which would be in all the papers tomorrow 
2732,such were his rattles  his baubles  in playing with which he had grown white  come to the verge of old age  enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the english public school man 
2733,inevitably one made up things like that about hugh  that was his style  the style of those admirable letters which peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the times  and had thanked god he was out of that pernicious hubble bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives 
2734,an olive skinned youth from one of the universities stood obsequiously by 
2735,him he would patronise  initiate  teach how to get on 
2736,for he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses  making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age  their affliction  thinking themselves quite forgotten  yet here was dear hugh driving up and spending an hour talking of the past  remembering trifles  praising the home made cake  though hugh might eat cake with a duchess any day of his life  and  to look at him  probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation 
2737,the all judging  the all merciful  might excuse 
2738,peter walsh had no mercy 
2739,villains there must be  and god knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than hugh whitbread and his kindness 
2740,look at him now  on tiptoe  dancing forward  bowing and scraping  as the prime minister and lady bruton emerged  intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something  something private  to lady bruton as she passed 
2741,she stopped 
2742,she wagged her fine old head 
2743,she was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility 
2744,she had her toadies  minor officials in government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf  in return for which she gave them luncheon 
2745,but she derived from the eighteenth century 
2746,she was all right 
2747,and now clarissa escorted her prime minister down the room  prancing  sparkling  with the stateliness of her grey hair 
2748,she wore ear rings  and a silver green mermaid own dress 
2749,lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed  having that gift still  to be  to exist  to sum it all up in the moment as she passed  turned  caught her scarf in some other woman own dress  unhitched it  laughed  all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element 
2750,but age had brushed her  even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves 
2751,there was a breath of tenderness  her severity  her prudery  her woodenness were all warmed through now  and she had about her as she said good bye to the thick gold laced man who was doing his best  and good luck to him  to look important  an inexpressible dignity  an exquisite cordiality  as if she wished the whole world well  and must now  being on the very verge and rim of things  take her leave 
2752,so she made him think 
2753, but he was not in love  
2754,indeed  clarissa felt  the prime minister had been good to come 
2755,and  walking down the room with him  with sally there and peter there and richard very pleased  with all those people rather inclined  perhaps  to envy  she had felt that intoxication of the moment  that dilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to quiver  steeped  upright   yes  but after all it was what other people felt  that  for  though she loved it and felt it tingle and sting  still these semblances  these triumphs  dear old peter  for example  thinking her so brilliant   had a hollowness  at arm own length they were  not in the heart  and it might be that she was growing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used  and suddenly  as she saw the prime minister go down the stairs  the gilt rim of the sir joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought back kilman with a rush  kilman her enemy  that was satisfying  that was real  ah  how she hated her  hot  hypocritical  corrupt  with all that power  elizabeth own seducer  the woman who had crept in to steal and defile  richard would say  what nonsense   
2756,she hated her  she loved her 
2757,it was enemies one wanted  not friends  not mrs  durrant and clara  sir william and lady bradshaw  miss truelock and eleanor gibson  whom she saw coming upstairs  
2758,they must find her if they wanted her 
2759,she was for the party 
2760,there was her old friend sir harry 
2761, dear sir harry   she said  going up to the fine old fellow who had produced more bad pictures than any other two academicians in the whole of st  john own wood  they were always of cattle  standing in sunset pools absorbing moisture  or signifying  for he had a certain range of gesture  by the raising of one foreleg and the toss of the antlers   the approach of the stranger   all his activities  dining out  racing  were founded on cattle standing absorbing moisture in sunset pools  
2762, what are you laughing at   she asked him 
2763,for willie titcomb and sir harry and herbert ainsty were all laughing 
2764,but no 
2765,sir harry could not tell clarissa dalloway  much though he liked her  of her type he thought her perfect  and threatened to paint her  his stories of the music hall stage 
2766,he chaffed her about her party 
2767,he missed his brandy 
2768,these circles  he said  were above him 
2769,but he liked her  respected her  in spite of her damnable  difficult upper class refinement  which made it impossible to ask clarissa dalloway to sit on his knee 
2770,and up came that wandering will of the wisp  that vagulous phosphorescence  old mrs  hilbery  stretching her hands to the blaze of his laughter  about the duke and the lady   which  as she heard it across the room  seemed to reassure her on a point which sometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning and did not like to call her maid for a cup of tea  how it is certain we must die 
2771, they will not tell us their stories   said clarissa 
2772, dear clarissa   exclaimed mrs  hilbery 
2773,she looked to night  she said  so like her mother as she first saw her walking in a garden in a grey hat 
2774,and really clarissa own eyes filled with tears 
2775,her mother  walking in a garden 
2776,but alas  she must go 
2777,for there was professor brierly  who lectured on milton  talking to little jim hutton  who was unable even for a party like this to compass both tie and waistcoat or make his hair lie flat   and even at this distance they were quarrelling  she could see 
2778,for professor brierly was a very queer fish 
2779,with all those degrees  honours  lectureships between him and the scribblers he suspected instantly an atmosphere not favourable to his queer compound  his prodigious learning and timidity  his wintry charm without cordiality  his innocence blent with snobbery  he quivered if made conscious by a lady own unkempt hair  a youth own boots  of an underworld  very creditable doubtless  of rebels  of ardent young people  of would be geniuses  and intimated with a little toss of the head  with a sniff  humph   the value of moderation  of some slight training in the classics in order to appreciate milton 
2780,professor brierly  clarissa could see  was not hitting it off with little jim hutton  who wore red socks  his black being at the laundry  about milton 
2781,she interrupted 
2782,she said she loved bach 
2783,so did hutton 
2784,that was the bond between them  and hutton  a very bad poet  always felt that mrs  dalloway was far the best of the great ladies who took an interest in art 
2785,it was odd how strict she was 
2786,about music she was purely impersonal 
2787,she was rather a prig 
2788,but how charming to look at 
2789,she made her house so nice if it were not for her professors 
2790,clarissa had half a mind to snatch him off and set him down at the piano in the back room 
2791,for he played divinely 
2792, but the noise   she said 
2793, the noise  
2794, the sign of a successful party  
2795,nodding urbanely  the professor stepped delicately off 
2796, he knows everything in the whole world about milton   said clarissa 
2797, does he indeed   said hutton  who would imitate the professor throughout hampstead  the professor on milton  the professor on moderation  the professor stepping delicately off 
2798,but she must speak to that couple  said clarissa  lord gayton and nancy blow 
2799,not that they added perceptibly to the noise of the party 
2800,they were not talking  perceptibly  as they stood side by side by the yellow curtains 
2801,they would soon be off elsewhere  together  and never had very much to say in any circumstances 
2802,they looked  that was all 
2803,that was enough 
2804,they looked so clean  so sound  she with an apricot bloom of powder and paint  but he scrubbed  rinsed  with the eyes of a bird  so that no ball could pass him or stroke surprise him 
2805,he struck  he leapt  accurately  on the spot 
2806,ponies  mouths quivered at the end of his reins 
2807,he had his honours  ancestral monuments  banners hanging in the church at home 
2808,he had his duties  his tenants  a mother and sisters  had been all day at lords  and that was what they were talking about  cricket  cousins  the movies  when mrs  dalloway came up 
2809,lord gayton liked her most awfully 
2810,so did miss blow 
2811,she had such charming manners 
2812, it is angelic  it is delicious of you to have come   she said 
2813,she loved lords  she loved youth  and nancy  dressed at enormous expense by the greatest artists in paris  stood there looking as if her body had merely put forth  of its own accord  a green frill 
2814, i had meant to have dancing   said clarissa 
2815,for the young people could not talk 
2816,and why should they 
2817,shout  embrace  swing  be up at dawn  carry sugar to ponies  kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows  and then all tingling and streaming  plunge and swim 
2818,but the enormous resources of the english language  the power it bestows  after all  of communicating feelings  at their age  she and peter would have been arguing all the evening   was not for them 
2819,they would solidify young 
2820,they would be good beyond measure to the people on the estate  but alone  perhaps  rather dull 
2821, what a pity   she said 
2822, i had hoped to have dancing  
2823,it was so extraordinarily nice of them to have come 
2824,but talk of dancing 
2825,the rooms were packed 
2826,there was old aunt helena in her shawl 
2827,alas  she must leave them  lord gayton and nancy blow 
2828,there was old miss parry  her aunt 
2829,for miss helena parry was not dead  miss parry was alive 
2830,she was past eighty 
2831,she ascended staircases slowly with a stick 
2832,she was placed in a chair  richard had seen to it  
2833,people who had known burma in the  owneventies were always led up to her 
2834,where had peter got to 
2835,they used to be such friends 
2836,for at the mention of india  or even ceylon  her eyes  only one was glass  slowly deepened  became blue  beheld  not human beings  she had no tender memories  no proud illusions about viceroys  generals  mutinies  it was orchids she saw  and mountain passes and herself carried on the backs of coolies in the  ownixties over solitary peaks  or descending to uproot orchids  startling blossoms  never beheld before  which she painted in water colour  an indomitable englishwoman  fretful if disturbed by the war  say  which dropped a bomb at her very door  from her deep meditation over orchids and her own figure journeying in the  ownixties in india  but here was peter 
2837, come and talk to aunt helena about burma   said clarissa 
2838,and yet he had not had a word with her all the evening 
2839, we will talk later   said clarissa  leading him up to aunt helena  in her white shawl  with her stick 
2840, peter walsh   said clarissa 
2841,that meant nothing 
2842,clarissa had asked her 
2843,it was tiring  it was noisy  but clarissa had asked her 
2844,so she had come 
2845,it was a pity that they lived in london  richard and clarissa 
2846,if only for clarissa own health it would have been better to live in the country 
2847,but clarissa had always been fond of society 
2848, he has been in burma   said clarissa 
2849,she could not resist recalling what charles darwin had said about her little book on the orchids of burma 
2850, clarissa must speak to lady bruton  
2851,no doubt it was forgotten now  her book on the orchids of burma  but it went into three editions before   she told peter 
2852,she remembered him now 
2853,he had been at bourton  and he had left her  peter walsh remembered  without a word in the drawing room that night when clarissa had asked him to come boating  
2854, richard so much enjoyed his lunch party   said clarissa to lady bruton 
2855, richard was the greatest possible help   lady bruton replied 
2856, he helped me to write a letter  and how are you  
2857, oh  perfectly well   said clarissa 
2858, lady bruton detested illness in the wives of politicians  
2859, and there is peter walsh   said lady bruton  for she could never think of anything to say to clarissa  though she liked her  she had lots of fine qualities  but they had nothing in common  she and clarissa  it might have been better if richard had married a woman with less charm  who would have helped him more in his work  he had lost his chance of the cabinet  
2860, there is peter walsh   she said  shaking hands with that agreeable sinner  that very able fellow who should have made a name for himself but had not  always in difficulties with women   and  of course  old miss parry 
2861,wonderful old lady 
2862,lady bruton stood by miss parry own chair  a spectral grenadier  draped in black  inviting peter walsh to lunch  cordial  but without small talk  remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of india 
2863,she had been there  of course  had stayed with three viceroys  thought some of the indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows  but what a tragedy it was  the state of india  the prime minister had just been telling her  old miss parry huddled up in her shawl  did not care what the prime minister had just been telling her   and lady bruton would like to have peter walsh own opinion  he being fresh from the centre  and she would get sir sampson to meet him  for really it prevented her from sleeping at night  the folly of it  the wickedness she might say  being a soldier own daughter  she was an old woman now  not good for much  but her house  her servants  her good friend milly brush  did he remember her   were all there only asking to be used if  if they could be of help  in short 
2864,for she never spoke of england  but this isle of men  this dear  dear land  was in her blood  without reading shakespeare   and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow  could have led troops to attack  ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church  or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside  that woman was millicent bruton 
2865,debarred by her sex and some truancy  too  of the logical faculty  she found it impossible to write a letter to the times   she had the thought of empire always at hand  and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing  her robustness of demeanour  so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which  in some spiritual shape  the union jack had ceased to fly 
2866,to be not english even among the dead  no  no 
2867,impossible 
2868,but was it lady bruton  whom she used to know  
2869,was it peter walsh grown grey 
2870,lady rosseter asked herself  who had been sally seton  
2871,it was old miss parry certainly  the old aunt who used to be so cross when she stayed at bourton 
2872,never should she forget running along the passage naked  and being sent for by miss parry 
2873,and clarissa  oh clarissa 
2874,sally caught her by the arm 
2875,clarissa stopped beside them 
2876, but i cannot stay   she said 
2877, i shall come later  wait   she said  looking at peter and sally 
2878,they must wait  she meant  until all these people had gone 
2879, i shall come back   she said  looking at her old friends  sally and peter  who were shaking hands  and sally  remembering the past no doubt  was laughing 
2880,but her voice was wrung of its old ravishing richness  her eyes not aglow as they used to be  when she smoked cigars  when she ran down the passage to fetch her sponge bag  without a stitch of clothing on her  and ellen atkins asked  what if the gentlemen had met her 
2881,but everybody forgave her 
2882,she stole a chicken from the larder because she was hungry in the night  she smoked cigars in her bedroom  she left a priceless book in the punt 
2883,but everybody adored her  except perhaps papa  
2884,it was her warmth  her vitality  she would paint  she would write 
2885,old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after  your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright  
2886,she accused hugh whitbread  of all people  and there he was  her old friend hugh  talking to the portuguese ambassador   of kissing her in the smoking room to punish her for saying that women should have votes 
2887,vulgar men did  she said 
2888,and clarissa remembered having to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers  which she was capable of doing with her daring  her recklessness  her melodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating scenes  and it was bound  clarissa used to think  to end in some awful tragedy  her death  her martyrdom  instead of which she had married  quite unexpectedly  a bald man with a large buttonhole who owned  it was said  cotton mills at manchester 
2889,and she had five boys 
2890,she and peter had settled down together 
2891,they were talking  it seemed so familiar  that they should be talking 
2892,they would discuss the past 
2893,with the two of them  more even than with richard  she shared her past  the garden  the trees  old joseph breitkopf singing brahms without any voice  the drawing room wallpaper  the smell of the mats 
2894,a part of this sally must always be  peter must always be 
2895,but she must leave them 
2896,there were the bradshaws  whom she disliked 
2897,she must go up to lady bradshaw  in grey and silver  balancing like a sea lion at the edge of its tank  barking for invitations  duchesses  the typical successful man own wife   she must go up to lady bradshaw and say
2898,but lady bradshaw anticipated her 
2899, we are shockingly late  dear mrs  dalloway  we hardly dared to come in   she said 
2900,and sir william  who looked very distinguished  with his grey hair and blue eyes  said yes  they had not been able to resist the temptation 
2901,he was talking to richard about that bill probably  which they wanted to get through the commons 
2902,why did the sight of him  talking to richard  curl her up 
2903,he looked what he was  a great doctor 
2904,a man absolutely at the head of his profession  very powerful  rather worn 
2905,for think what cases came before him  people in the uttermost depths of misery  people on the verge of insanity  husbands and wives  he had to decide questions of appalling difficulty  yet  what she felt was  one would not like sir william to see one unhappy 
2906,no  not that man 
2907, how is your son at eton   she asked lady bradshaw 
2908,he had just missed his eleven  said lady bradshaw  because of the mumps 
2909,his father minded even more than he did  she thought  being   she said   nothing but a great boy himself  
2910,clarissa looked at sir william  talking to richard 
2911,he did not look like a boy  not in the least like a boy  she had once gone with some one to ask his advice  he had been perfectly right  extremely sensible  but heavens  what a relief to get out to the street again 
2912,there was some poor wretch sobbing  she remembered  in the waiting room 
2913,but she did not know what it was  about sir william  what exactly she disliked 
2914,only richard agreed with her   did not like his taste  did not like his smell  
2915,but he was extraordinarily able 
2916,they were talking about this bill 
2917,some case  sir william was mentioning  lowering his voice 
2918,it had its bearing upon what he was saying about the deferred effects of she will shock 
2919,there must be some provision in the bill 
2920,sinking her voice  drawing mrs  dalloway into the shelter of a common femininity  a common pride in the illustrious qualities of husbands and their sad tendency to overwork  lady bradshaw  poor goose  one did not dislike her  murmured how   just as we were starting  my husband was called up on the telephone  a very sad case  a young man  that is what sir william is telling mr  dalloway  had killed himself  he had been in the army  
2921,oh  thought clarissa  in the middle of my party  here is death  she thought 
2922,she went on  into the little room where the prime minister had gone with lady bruton 
2923,perhaps there was somebody there 
2924,but there was nobody 
2925,the chairs still kept the impress of the prime minister and lady bruton  she turned deferentially  he sitting four square  authoritatively 
2926,they had been talking about india 
2927,there was nobody 
2928,the party own splendour fell to the floor  so strange it was to come in alone in her finery 
2929,what business had the bradshaws to talk of death at her party 
2930,a young man had killed himself 
2931,and they talked of it at her party  the bradshaws  talked of death  he had killed himself  but how 
2932,always her body went through it first  when she was told  suddenly  of an accident  her dress flamed  her body burnt 
2933,he had thrown himself from a window 
2934,up had flashed the ground  through him  blundering  bruising  went the rusty spikes 
2935,there he lay with a thud  thud  thud in his brain  and then a suffocation of blackness 
2936,so she saw it 
2937,but why had he done it 
2938,and the bradshaws talked of it at her party 
2939,she had once thrown a shilling into the serpentine  never anything more 
2940,but he had flung it away 
2941,they went on living  she would have to go back  the rooms were still crowded  people kept on coming  
2942,they  all day she had been thinking of bourton  of peter  of sally   they would grow old 
2943,a thing there was that mattered  a thing  wreathed about with chatter  defaced  obscured in her own life  let drop every day in corruption  lies  chatter 
2944,this he had preserved 
2945,death was defiance 
2946,death was an attempt to communicate  people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which  mystically  evaded them  closeness drew apart  rapture faded  one was alone 
2947,there was an embrace in death 
2948,but this young man who had killed himself  had he plunged holding his treasure 
2949, if it were now to die   twere now to be most happy   she had said to herself once  coming down in white 
2950,or there were the poets and thinkers 
2951,suppose he had had that passion  and had gone to sir william bradshaw  a great doctor yet to her obscurely evil  without sex or lust  extremely polite to women  but capable of some indescribable outrage  forcing your soul  that was it  if this young man had gone to him  and sir william had impressed him  like that  with his power  might he not then have said  indeed she felt it now   life is made intolerable  they make life intolerable  men like that 
2952,then  she had felt it only this morning  there was the terror  the overwhelming incapacity  one own parents giving it into one own hands  this life  to be lived to the end  to be walked with serenely  there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear 
2953,even now  quite often if richard had not been there reading the times  so that she could crouch like a bird and gradually revive  send roaring up that immeasurable delight  rubbing stick to stick  one thing with another  she must have perished 
2954,but that young man had killed himself 
2955,somehow it was her disaster  her disgrace 
2956,it was her punishment to see sink and disappear here a man  there a woman  in this profound darkness  and she forced to stand here in her evening dress 
2957,she had schemed  she had pilfered 
2958,she was never wholly admirable 
2959,she had wanted success 
2960,lady bexborough and the rest of it 
2961,and once she had walked on the terrace at bourton 
2962,it was due to richard  she had never been so happy 
2963,nothing could be slow enough  nothing last too long 
2964,no pleasure could equal  she thought  straightening the chairs  pushing in one book on the shelf  this having done with the triumphs of youth  lost herself in the process of living  to find it  with a shock of delight  as the sun rose  as the day sank 
2965,many a time had she gone  at bourton when they were all talking  to look at the sky  or seen it between people own shoulders at dinner  seen it in london when she could not sleep 
2966,she walked to the window 
2967,it held  foolish as the idea was  something of her own in it  this country sky  this sky above westminster 
2968,she parted the curtains  she looked 
2969,oh  but how surprising   in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her  she was going to bed  and the sky  it will be a solemn sky  she had thought  it will be a dusky sky  turning away its cheek in beauty  but there it was  ashen pale  raced over quickly by tapering vast clouds 
2970,it was new to her 
2971,the wind must have risen 
2972,she was going to bed  in the room opposite 
2973,it was fascinating to watch her  moving about  that old lady  crossing the room  coming to the window 
2974,could she see her 
2975,it was fascinating  with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing room  to watch that old woman  quite quietly  going to bed 
2976,she pulled the blind now 
2977,the clock began striking 
2978,the young man had killed himself  but she did not pity him  with the clock striking the hour  one  two  three  she did not pity him  with all this going on 
2979,there  the old lady had put out her light  the whole house was dark now with this going on  she repeated  and the words came to her  fear no more the heat of the sun 
2980,she must go back to them 
2981,but what an extraordinary night 
2982,she felt somehow very like him  the young man who had killed himself 
2983,she felt glad that he had done it  thrown it away 
2984,the clock was striking 
2985,the leaden circles dissolved in the air 
2986,he made her feel the beauty  made her feel the fun 
2987,but she must go back 
2988,she must assemble 
2989,she must find sally and peter 
2990,and she came in from the little room 
2991, but where is clarissa   said peter 
2992,he was sitting on the sofa with sally 
2993, after all these years he really could not call her  lady rosseter     where is the woman gone to   he asked 
2994, where is clarissa  
2995,sally supposed  and so did peter for the matter of that  that there were people of importance  politicians  whom neither of them knew unless by sight in the picture papers  whom clarissa had to be nice to  had to talk to 
2996,she was with them 
2997,yet there was richard dalloway not in the cabinet 
2998,he had not been a success  sally supposed 
2999,for herself  she scarcely ever read the papers 
3000,she sometimes saw his name mentioned 
3001,but then  well  she lived a very solitary life  in the wilds  clarissa would say  among great merchants  great manufacturers  men  after all  who did things 
3002,she had done things too 
3003, i have five sons   she told him 
3004,lord  lord  what a change had come over her  the softness of motherhood  its egotism too 
3005,last time they met  peter remembered  had been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight  the leaves  like rough bronze  she had said  with her literary turn  and she had picked a rose 
3006,she had marched him up and down that awful night  after the scene by the fountain  he was to catch the midnight train 
3007,heavens  he had wept 
3008,that was his old trick  opening a pocket knife  thought sally  always opening and shutting a knife when he got excited 
3009,they had been very  very intimate  she and peter walsh  when he was in love with clarissa  and there was that dreadful  ridiculous scene over richard dalloway at lunch 
3010,she had called richard  wickham  
3011,why not call richard  wickham  
3012,clarissa had flared up  and indeed they had never seen each other since  she and clarissa  not more than half a dozen times perhaps in the last ten years 
3013,and peter walsh had gone off to india  and she had heard vaguely that he had made an unhappy marriage  and she did not know whether he had any children  and she could not ask him  for he had changed 
3014,he was rather shrivelled looking  but kinder  she felt  and she had a real affection for him  for he was connected with her youth  and she still had a little emily bront he had given her  and he was to write  surely 
3015,in those days he was to write 
3016, have you written   she asked him  spreading her hand  her firm and shapely hand  on her knee in a way he recalled 
3017, not a word   said peter walsh  and she laughed 
3018,she was still attractive  still a personage  sally seton 
3019,but who was this rosseter 
3020,he wore two camellias on his wedding day  that was all peter knew of him 
3021, they have myriads of servants  miles of conservatories   clarissa wrote  something like that 
3022,sally owned it with a shout of laughter 
3023, yes  i have ten thousand a year   whether before the tax was paid or after  she could not remember  for her husband   whom you must meet   she said   whom you would like   she said  did all that for her 
3024,and sally used to be in rags and tatters 
3025,she had pawned her grandmother own ring which marie antoinette had given her great grandfather to come to bourton 
3026,oh yes  sally remembered  she had it still  a ruby ring which marie antoinette had given her great grandfather 
3027,she never had a penny to her name in those days  and going to bourton always meant some frightful pinch 
3028,but going to bourton had meant so much to her  had kept her sane  she believed  so unhappy had she been at home  but that was all a thing of the past  all over now  she said 
3029,and mr  parry was dead  and miss parry was still alive 
3030,never had he had such a shock in his life  said peter 
3031,he had been quite certain she was dead 
3032,and the marriage had been  sally supposed  a success 
3033,and that very handsome  very self possessed young woman was elizabeth  over there  by the curtains  in red 
3034, she was like a poplar  she was like a river  she was like a hyacinth  willie titcomb was thinking  oh how much nicer to be in the country and do what she liked  she could hear her poor dog howling  elizabeth was certain  
3035,she was not a bit like clarissa  peter walsh said 
3036, oh  clarissa   said sally 
3037,what sally felt was simply this 
3038,she had owed clarissa an enormous amount 
3039,they had been friends  not acquaintances  friends  and she still saw clarissa all in white going about the house with her hands full of flowers  to this day tobacco plants made her think of bourton  but  did peter understand   she lacked something  lacked what was it  she had charm  she had extraordinary charm  but to be frank  and she felt that peter was an old friend  a real friend  did absence matter  did distance matter  she had often wanted to write to him  but torn it up  yet felt he understood  for people understand without things being said  as one realises growing old  and old she was  had been that afternoon to see her sons at eton  where they had the mumps   to be quite frank then  how could clarissa have done it   married richard dalloway 
3040,a sportsman  a man who cared only for dogs 
3041,literally  when he came into the room he smelt of the stables 
3042,and then all this 
3043,she waved her hand 
3044,hugh whitbread it was  strolling past in his white waistcoat  dim  fat  blind  past everything he looked  except self esteem and comfort 
3045, he is not going to recognise us   said sally  and really she had not the courage  so that was hugh  the admirable hugh 
3046, and what does he do   she asked peter 
3047,he blacked the king own boots or counted bottles at windsor  peter told her 
3048,peter kept his sharp tongue still 
3049,but sally must be frank  peter said 
3050,that kiss now  hugh own 
3051,on the lips  she assured him  in the smoking room one evening 
3052,she went straight to clarissa in a rage 
3053,hugh did not do such things 
3054,clarissa said  the admirable hugh 
3055,hugh own socks were without exception the most beautiful she had ever seen  and now his evening dress 
3056,perfect 
3057,and had he children 
3058, everybody in the room has six sons at eton   peter told her  except himself 
3059,he  thank god  had none 
3060,no sons  no daughters  no wife 
3061,well  he did not seem to mind  said sally 
3062,he looked younger  she thought  than any of them 
3063,but it had been a silly thing to do  in many ways  peter said  to marry like that   a perfect goose she was   he said  but  he said   we had a splendid time of it   but how could that be 
3064,sally wondered  what did he mean 
3065,and how odd it was to know him and yet not know a single thing that had happened to him 
3066,and did he say it out of pride 
3067,very likely  for after all it must be galling for him  though he was an oddity  a sort of sprite  not at all an ordinary man   it must be lonely at his age to have no home  nowhere to go to 
3068,but he must stay with them for weeks and weeks 
3069,of course he would  he would love to stay with them  and that was how it came out 
3070,all these years the dalloways had never been once 
3071,time after time they had asked them 
3072,clarissa  for it was clarissa of course  would not come 
3073,for  said sally  clarissa was at heart a snob  one had to admit it  a snob  and it was that that was between them  she was convinced  clarissa thought she had married beneath her  her husband being  she was proud of it  a miner own son 
3074,every penny they had he had earned 
3075,as a little boy  her voice trembled  he had carried great sacks 
3076, and so she would go on  peter felt  hour after hour  the miner own son  people thought she had married beneath her  her five sons  and what was the other thing  plants  hydrangeas  syringas  very  very rare hibiscus lilies that never grow north of the suez canal  but she  with one gardener in a suburb near manchester  had beds of them  positively beds  now all that clarissa had escaped  unmaternal as she was  
3077,a snob was she 
3078,yes  in many ways 
3079,where was she  all this time 
3080,it was getting late 
3081, yet   said sally   when i heard clarissa was giving a party  i felt i could not not come  must see her again  and I am staying in victoria street  practically next door   so i just came without an invitation  but   she whispered   tell me  do  who is this  
3082,it was mrs  hilbery  looking for the door 
3083,for how late it was getting 
3084,and  she murmured  as the night grew later  as people went  one found old friends  quiet nooks and corners  and the loveliest views 
3085,did they know  she asked  that they were surrounded by an enchanted garden 
3086,lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and the sky 
3087,just a few fairy lamps  clarissa dalloway had said  in the back garden 
3088,but she was a magician 
3089,it was a park 
3090,      and she did not know their names  but friends she knew they were  friends without names  songs without words  always the best 
3091,but there were so many doors  such unexpected places  she could not find her way 
3092, old mrs  hilbery   said peter  but who was that 
3093,that lady standing by the curtain all the evening  without speaking 
3094,he knew her face  connected her with bourton 
3095,surely she used to cut up underclothes at the large table in the window 
3096,davidson  was that her name 
3097, oh  that is ellie henderson   said sally 
3098,clarissa was really very hard on her 
3099,she was a cousin  very poor 
3100,clarissa was hard on people 
3101,she was rather  said peter 
3102,yet  said sally  in her emotional way  with a rush of that enthusiasm which peter used to love her for  yet dreaded a little now  so effusive she might become  how generous to her friends clarissa was  and what a rare quality one found it  and how sometimes at night or on christmas day  when she counted up her blessings  she put that friendship first 
3103,they were young  that was it 
3104,clarissa was pure hearted  that was it 
3105,peter would think her sentimental 
3106,so she was 
3107,for she had come to feel that it was the only thing worth saying  what one felt 
3108,cleverness was silly 
3109,one must say simply what one felt 
3110, but i do not know   said peter walsh   what i feel  
3111,poor peter  thought sally 
3112,why did not clarissa come and talk to them 
3113,that was what he was longing for 
3114,she knew it 
3115,all the time he was thinking only of clarissa  and was fidgeting with his knife 
3116,he had not found life simple  peter said 
3117,his relations with clarissa had not been simple 
3118,it had spoilt his life  he said 
3119, they had been so intimate  he and sally seton  it was absurd not to say it  
3120,one could not be in love twice  he said  and what could she say  still  it is better to have loved  but he would think her sentimental  he used to be so sharp  
3121,he must come and stay with them in manchester 
3122,that is all very true  he said 
3123,all very true 
3124,he would love to come and stay with them  directly he had done what he had to do in london 
3125,and clarissa had cared for him more than she had ever cared for richard 
3126,sally was positive of that 
3127, no  no  no   said peter  sally should not have said that  she went too far   that good fellow  there he was at the end of the room  holding forth  the same as ever  dear old richard 
3128,who was he talking to 
3129,sally asked  that very distinguished looking man 
3130,living in the wilds as she did  she had an insatiable curiosity to know who people were 
3131,but peter did not know 
3132,he did not like his looks  he said  probably a cabinet minister 
3133,of them all  richard seemed to him the best  he said  the most disinterested 
3134, but what has he done  
3135,sally asked 
3136,public work  she supposed 
3137,and were they happy together 
3138,sally asked  she herself was extremely happy   for  she admitted  she knew nothing about them  only jumped to conclusions  as one does  for what can one know even of the people one lives with every day 
3139,she asked 
3140,are we not all prisoners 
3141,she had read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of his cell  and she had felt that was true of life  one scratched on the wall 
3142,despairing of human relationships  people were so difficult   she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women never gave her 
3143,but no  he did not like cabbages  he preferred human beings  peter said 
3144,indeed  the young are beautiful  sally said  watching elizabeth cross the room 
3145,how unlike clarissa at her age 
3146,could he make anything of her 
3147,she would not open her lips 
3148,not much  not yet  peter admitted 
3149,she was like a lily  sally said  a lily by the side of a pool 
3150,but peter did not agree that we know nothing 
3151,we know everything  he said  at least he did 
3152,but these two  sally whispered  these two coming now  and really she must go  if clarissa did not come soon   this distinguished looking man and his rather common looking wife who had been talking to richard  what could one know about people like that 
3153, that they are damnable humbugs   said peter  looking at them casually 
3154,he made sally laugh 
3155,but sir william bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture 
3156,he looked in the corner for the engraver own name 
3157,his wife looked too 
3158,sir william bradshaw was so interested in art 
3159,when one was young  said peter  one was too much excited to know people 
3160,now that one was old  fifty two to be precise  sally was fifty five  in body  she said  but her heart was like a girl own of twenty   now that one was mature then  said peter  one could watch  one could understand  and one did not lose the power of feeling  he said 
3161,no  that is true  said sally 
3162,she felt more deeply  more passionately  every year 
3163,it increased  he said  alas  perhaps  but one should be glad of it  it went on increasing in his experience  there was some one in india  he would like to tell sally about her  he would like sally to know her  she was married  he said  she had two small children  they must all come to manchester  said sally  he must promise before they left 
3164,there is elizabeth  he said  she feels not half what we feel  not yet 
3165,but  said sally  watching elizabeth go to her father  one can see they are devoted to each other 
3166,she could feel it by the way elizabeth went to her father 
3167,for her father had been looking at her  as he stood talking to the bradshaws  and he had thought to himself  who is that lovely girl 
3168,and suddenly he realised that it was his elizabeth  and he had not recognised her  she looked so lovely in her pink frock 
3169,elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to willie titcomb 
3170,so she went to him and they stood together  now that the party was almost over  looking at the people going  and the rooms getting emptier and emptier  with things scattered on the floor 
3171,even ellie henderson was going  nearly last of all  though no one had spoken to her  but she had wanted to see everything  to tell edith 
3172,and richard and elizabeth were rather glad it was over  but richard was proud of his daughter 
3173,and he had not meant to tell her  but he could not help telling her 
3174,he had looked at her  he said  and he had wondered  who is that lovely girl 
3175,and it was his daughter 
3176,that did make her happy 
3177,but her poor dog was howling 
3178, richard has improved  you are right   said sally 
3179, i shall go and talk to him  i shall say goodnight  what does the brain matter   said lady rosseter  getting up   compared with the heart  
3180, i will come   said peter  but he sat on for a moment 
3181,what is this terror 
3182,what is this ecstasy 
3183,he thought to himself 
3184,what is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement 
3185,it is clarissa  he said 
3186,for there she was
