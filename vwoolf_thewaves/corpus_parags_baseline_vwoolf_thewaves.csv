The bright eyes of hopping birds--eagles, vultures--are apparent. They take us for fallen trees. They pick at a worm--that is a hooded cobra--and leave it with a festering brown scar to be mauled by lions. This is our world, lit with crescents and stars of light; and great petals half transparent block the openings like purple windows. Everything is strange. Things are huge and very small.

And Ernest kissed her. He was in his green baize apron, cleaning silver; and his mouth was sucked like a purse in wrinkles and he seized her with the pyjamas blown out hard between them. He was blind as a bull, and she swooned in anguish, only little veins streaking her white cheeks red. Now though they pass plates of bread and butter and cups of milk at tea-time I see a crack in the earth and hot steam hisses up; and the urn roars as Ernest roared, and I am blown out hard like the pyjamas, even while my teeth meet in the soft bread and butter, and I lap the sweet milk. I am not afraid of heat, nor of the frozen winter. Rhoda dreams, sucking a crust soaked in milk; Louis regards the wall opposite with snail-green eyes; Bernard moulds his bread into pellets and calls them ""people"".

I rejoice; my heart expands in his bulk, in his authority. He lays the whirling dust clouds in my tremulous, my ignominiously agitated mind--how we danced round the Christmas tree and handing parcels they forgot me, and the fat woman said, ""This little boy has no present,"" and gave me a shiny Union Jack from the top of the tree, and I cried with fury--to be remembered with pity. Now all is laid by his authority, his crucifix, and I feel come over me the sense of the earth under me, and my roots going down and down till they wrap themselves round some hardness at the centre. I recover my continuity, as he reads. I become a figure in the procession, a spoke in the huge wheel that turning, at last erects me, here and now. I have been in the dark; I have been hidden; but when the wheel turns (as he reads) I rise into this dim light where I just perceive, but scarcely, kneeling boys, pillars and memorial brasses.

Now he lurches back to his seat like a drunken sailor. It is an action that all the other masters will try to imitate; but, being flimsy, being floppy, wearing grey trousers, they will only succeed in making themselves ridiculous. I do not despise them. Their antics seem pitiable in my eyes. I note the fact for future reference with many others in my notebook. When I am grown up I shall carry a notebook--a fat book with many pages, methodically lettered. I shall enter my phrases. Under B shall come ""Butterfly powder"". If, in my novel, I describe the sun on the window-sill, I shall look under B and find butterfly powder. That will be useful. The tree ""shades the window with green fingers"". That will be useful.

94,94,4,"'But Bernard goes on talking. Up they bubble--images. ""Like a camel,"" . . . ""a vulture."" The camel is a vulture; the vulture a camel; for Bernard is a dangling wire, loose, but seductive. Yes, for when he talks, when he makes his foolish comparisons, a lightness comes over one. One floats, too, as if one were that bubble; one is freed; I have escaped, one feels. Even the chubby little boys (Dalton, Larpent and Baker) feel the same abandonment. They like this better than the cricket. They catch the phrases as they bubble. They let the feathery grasses tickle their noses. And then we all feel Percival lying heavy among us. His curious guffaw seems to sanction our laughter. But now he has rolled himself over in the long grass. He is, I think, chewing a stalk between his teeth. He feels bored; I too feel bored. Bernard at once perceives that we are bored. I detect a certain effort, an extravagance in his phrase, as if he said ""Look!"" but Percival says ""No."" For he is always the first to detect insincerity; and is brutal in the extreme. The sentence tails off feebly. Yes, the appalling moment has come when Bernard's power fails him and there is no longer any sequence and he sags and twiddles a bit of string and falls silent, gaping as if about to burst into tears.

We are parting; some to tea; some to the nets; I to show my essay to Mr Barker. This will endure. From discord, from hatred (I despise dabblers in imagery--I resent the power of Percival intensely) my shattered mind is pieced together by some sudden perception. I take the trees, the clouds, to be witnesses of my complete integration. I, Louis, I, who shall walk the earth these seventy years, am born entire, out of hatred, out of discord.

And my lips are too wide, and my eyes are too close together; I show my gums too much when I laugh. Susan's head, with its fell look, with its grass-green eyes which poets will love, Bernard said, because they fall upon close white stitching, put mine out; even Rhoda's face, mooning, vacant, is completed, like those white petals she used to swim in her bowl. So I skip up the stairs past them, to the next landing, where the long glass hangs and I see myself entire. I see my body and head in one now; for even in this serge frock they are one, my body and my head. Look, when I move my head I ripple all down my narrow body; even my thin legs ripple like a stalk in the wind. I flicker between the set face of Susan and Rhoda's vagueness; I leap like one of those flames that run between the cracks of the earth; I move, I dance; I never cease to move and to dance. I move like the leaf that moved in the hedge as a child and frightened me. I dance over these streaked, these impersonal, distempered walls with their yellow skirting as firelight dances over teapots. I catch fire even from women's cold eyes. When I read, a purple rim runs round the black edge of the textbook. Yet I cannot follow any word through its changes. I cannot follow any thought from present to past. I do not stand lost, like Susan, with tears in my eyes remembering home; or lie, like Rhoda, crumpled among the ferns, staining my pink cotton green, while I dream of plants that flower under the sea, and rocks through which the fish swim slowly.

Everything in my body seems thinned out with running and triumph. My blood must be bright red, whipped up, slapping against my ribs. My soles tingle, as if wire rings opened and shut in my feet. I see every blade of grass very clear. But the pulse drums so in my forehead, behind my eyes, that everything dances--the net, the grass; your faces leap like butterflies; the trees seem to jump up and down.

All their heads turn simultaneously at the corner by the laurel bushes. Now they are boasting. Larpent's brother played football for Oxford; Smith's father made a century at Lords. Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith; then again Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith--the names repeat themselves; the names are the same always. They are the volunteers; they are the cricketers; they are the officers of the Natural History Society. They are always forming into fours and marching in troops with badges on their caps; they salute simultaneously passing the figure of their general. How majestic is their order, how beautiful is their obedience! If I could follow, if I could be with them, I would sacrifice all I know. But they also leave butterflies trembling with their wings pinched off; they throw dirty pocket-handkerchiefs clotted with blood screwed up into corners. They make little boys sob in dark passages. They have big red ears that stand out under their caps. Yet that is what we wish to be, Neville and I. I watch them go with envy. Peeping from behind a curtain, I note the simultaneity of their movements with delight. If my legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run!

He takes my devotion; he accepts my tremulous, no doubt abject offering, mixed with contempt as it is for his mind. For he cannot read. Yet when I read Shakespeare or Catullus, lying in the long grass, he understands more than Louis. Not the words--but what are words? Do I not know already how to rhyme, how to imitate Pope, Dryden, even Shakespeare? But I cannot stand all day in the sun with my eyes on the ball; I cannot feel the flight of the ball through my body and think only of the ball. I shall be a clinger to the outsides of words all my life. Yet I could not live with him and suffer his stupidity. He will coarsen and snore. He will marry and there will be scenes of tenderness at breakfast. But now he is young. Not a thread, not a sheet of paper lies between him and the sun, between him and the rain, between him and the moon as he lies naked, tumbled, hot, on his bed. Now as they drive along the high road in their brake his face is mottled red and yellow. He will throw off his coat and stand with his legs apart, with his hands ready, watching the wicket.

111,111,6,"'When Dr Crane lurches through the swing-doors after prayers he is convinced, it seems, of his immense superiority; and indeed Neville, we cannot deny that his departure leaves us not only with a sense of relief, but also with a sense of something removed, like a tooth. Now let us follow him as he heaves through the swing-door to his own apartments. Let us imagine him in his private room over the stables undressing. He unfastens his sock suspenders (let us be trivial, let us be intimate). Then with a characteristic gesture (it is difficult to avoid these ready-made phrases, and they are, in his case, somehow appropriate) he takes the silver, he takes the coppers from his trouser pockets and places them there, and there, on his dressing-table. With both arms stretched on the arms of his chair he reflects (this is his private moment; it is here we must try to catch him): shall he cross the pink bridge into his bedroom or shall he not cross it? The two rooms are united by a bridge of rosy light from the lamp at the bedside where Mrs Crane lies with her hair on the pillow reading a French memoir. As she reads, she sweeps her hand with an abandoned and despairing gesture over her forehead, and sighs, ""Is this all?"" comparing herself with some French duchess. Now, says the doctor, in two years I shall retire. I shall clip yew hedges in a west country garden. An admiral I might have been; or a judge; not a schoolmaster. What forces, he asks, staring at the gas-fire with his shoulders hunched up more hugely than we know them (he is in his shirt-sleeves remember), have brought me to this? What vast forces? he thinks, getting into the stride of his majestic phrases as he looks over his shoulder at the window. It is a stormy night; the branches of the chestnut trees are ploughing up and down. Stars flash between them. What vast forces of good and evil have brought me here? he asks, and sees with sorrow that his chair has worn a little hole in the pile of the purple carpet. So there he sits, swinging his braces. But stories that follow people into their private rooms are difficult. I cannot go on with this story.

Yet I am struck still as I walk by sudden premonitions of what is to come. Yesterday, passing the open door leading into the private garden, I saw Fenwick with his mallet raised. The steam from the tea-urn rose in the middle of the lawn. There were banks of blue flowers. Then suddenly descended upon me the obscure, the mystic sense of adoration, of completeness that triumphed over chaos. Nobody saw my poised and intent figure as I stood at the open door.

114,114,6,"'I begin to wish,' said Louis, 'for night to come. As I stand here with my hand on the grained oak panel of Mr Wickham's door I think myself the friend of Richelieu, or the Duke of St Simon holding out a snuff-box to the King himself. It is my privilege. My witticisms ""run like wildfire through the court"". Duchesses tear emeralds from their earrings out of admiration--but these rockets rise best in darkness, in my cubicle at night. I am now a boy only with a colonial accent holding my knuckles against Mr Wickham's grained oak door. The day has been full of ignominies and triumphs concealed from fear of laughter. I am the best scholar in the school. But when darkness comes I put off this unenviable body--my large nose, my thin lips, my colonial accent--and inhabit space. I am then Virgil's companion, and Plato's. I am then the last scion of one of the great houses of France.

I shall throw myself on a bank by the river and watch the fish slip in and out among the reeds. The palms of my hands will be printed with pine-needles.

I respect the hand which gave them. He speaks with complete conviction. To him his words are true, though not to us. Speaking in the gruff voice of deep emotion, fiercely, tenderly, he has told us that we are about to go. He has bid us ""quit ourselves like men"". (On his lips quotations from the Bible, from The Times, seem equally magnificent.) Some will do this; others that. Some will not meet again. Neville, Bernard and I shall not meet here again. Life will divide us. But we have formed certain ties. Our boyish, our irresponsible years are over. But we have forged certain links. Above all, we have inherited traditions. These stone flags have been worn for six hundred years. On these walls are inscribed the names of men of war, of statesmen, of some unhappy poets (mine shall be among them). Blessings be on all traditions, on all safeguards and circumscriptions! I am most grateful to you men in black gowns, and you, dead, for your leading, for your guardianship; yet after all, the problem remains. The differences are not yet solved. Flowers toss their heads outside the window. I see wild birds, and impulses wilder than the wildest birds strike from my wild heart. My eyes are wild; my lips tight pressed.

124,124,8,"'This is the final ceremony,' said Bernard. This is the last of all our ceremonies. We are overcome by strange feelings. The guard holding his flag is about to blow his whistle; the train breathing steam in another moment is about to start. One wants to say something, to feel something, absolutely appropriate to the occasion. One's mind is primed; one's lips are pursed. And then a bee drifts in and hums round the flowers in the bouquet which Lady Hampton, the wife of the General, keeps smelling to show her appreciation of the compliment. If the bee were to sting her nose? We are all deeply moved; yet irreverent; yet penitent; yet anxious to get it over; yet reluctant to part. The bee distracts us; its casual flight seems to deride our intensity. Humming vaguely, skimming widely, it is settled now on the carnation. Many of us will not meet again. We shall not enjoy certain pleasures again, when we are free to go to bed, or to sit up, when I need no longer smuggle in bits of candle-ends and immoral literature. The bee now hums round the head of the great Doctor. Larpent, John, Archie, Percival, Baker and Smith--I have liked them enormously. I have known one mad boy only. I have hated one mean boy only. I enjoy in retrospect my terribly awkward breakfasts at the Headmaster's table with toast and marmalade. He alone does not notice the bee. If it were to settle on his nose he would flick it off with one magnificent gesture. Now he has made his joke; now his voice has almost broken but not quite. Now we are dismissed--Louis, Neville and I for ever. We take our highly polished books, scholastically inscribed in a little crabbed hand. We rise, we disperse; the pressure is removed. The bee has become an insignificant, a disregarded insect, flown through the open window into obscurity.

125,125,8,"'We are about to part,' said Neville. 'Here are the boxes; here are the cabs. There is Percival in his billycock hat. He will forget me. He will leave my letters lying about among guns and dogs unanswered. I shall send him poems and he will perhaps reply with a picture post card. But it is for that that I love him. I shall propose meeting--under a clock, by some Cross; and shall wait, and he will not come. It is for that that I love him. Oblivious, almost entirely ignorant, he will pass from my life. And I shall pass, incredible as it seems, into other lives; this is only an escapade perhaps, a prelude only. I feel already, though I cannot endure the Doctor's pompous mummery and faked emotions, that things we have only dimly perceived draw near. I shall be free to enter the garden where Fenwick raises his mallet. Those who have despised me shall acknowledge my sovereignty. But by some inscrutable law of my being sovereignty and the possession of power will not be enough; I shall always push through curtains to privacy, and want some whispered words alone. Therefore I go, dubious, but elate; apprehensive of intolerable pain; yet I think bound in my adventuring to conquer after huge suffering, bound, surely, to discover my desire in the end. There, for the last time, I see the statue of our pious founder with the doves about his head. They will wheel for ever about his head, whitening it, while the organ moans in the chapel. So I take my seat; and, when I have found my place in the comer of our reserved compartment, I will shade my eyes with a book to hide one tear; I will shade my eyes to observe; to peep at one face.

But now I pass on, out of London again; the fields begin again; and the houses, and women hanging washing, and trees and fields. London is now veiled, now vanished, now crumbled, now fallen.

128,128,9,"'I sit snug in my own corner going North,' said Jinny, 'in this roaring express which is yet so smooth that it flattens hedges, lengthens hills. We flash past signal-boxes; we make the earth rock slightly from side to side. The distance closes for ever in a point; and we for ever open the distance wide again. The telegraph poles bob up incessantly; one is felled, another rises. Now we roar and swing into a tunnel. The gentleman pulls up the window. I see reflections on the shining glass which lines the tunnel. I see him lower his paper. He smiles at my reflection in the tunnel. My body instantly of its own accord puts forth a frill under his gaze. My body lives a life of its own. Now the black window glass is green again. We are out of the tunnel. He reads his paper. But we have exchanged the approval of our bodies. There is then a great society of bodies, and mine is introduced; mine has come into the room where the gilt chairs are. Look--all the windows of the villas and their white-tented curtains dance; and the men sitting in the hedges in the cornfields with knotted blue handkerchiefs are aware too, as I am aware, of heat and rapture. One waves as we pass him. There are bowers and arbours in these villa gardens and young men in shirt-sleeves on ladders trimming roses. A man on a horse canters over the field. His horse plunges as we pass. And the rider turns to look at us. We roar again through blackness. And I lie back; I give myself up to rapture; I think that at the end of the tunnel I enter a lamp-lit room with chairs, into one of which I sink, much admired, my dress billowing round me.

I see its colour. June was white. I see the fields white with daisies, and white with dresses; and tennis courts marked with white. Then there was wind and violent thunder. There was a star riding through clouds one night, and I said to the star, ""Consume me."" That was at midsummer, after the garden party and my humiliation at the garden party. Wind and storm coloured July. Also, in the middle, cadaverous, awful, lay the grey puddle in the courtyard, when, holding an envelope in my hand, I carried a message. I came to the puddle. I could not cross it. Identity failed me. We are nothing, I said, and fell. I was blown like a feather, I was wafted down tunnels. Then very gingerly, I pushed my foot across.

Here is the ticket collector. Here are two men; three women; there is a cat in a basket; myself with my elbow on the window-sill--this is here and now. We draw on, we make off, through whispering fields of golden corn. Women in the fields are surprised to be left behind there, hoeing.

Only a few wild sheep live here; a few shaggy ponies; yet we are provided with every comfort; with tables to hold our newspapers, with rings to hold our tumblers. We come carrying these appliances with us over the top of the moor. Now we are on the summit. Silence will close behind us. If I look back over that bald head, I can see silence already closing and the shadows of clouds chasing each other over the empty moor; silence closes over our transient passage.

131,131,10,"'Now we are off,' said Louis. 'Now I hang suspended without attachments. We are nowhere. We are passing through England in a train. England slips by the window, always changing from hill to wood, from rivers and willows to towns again. And I have no firm ground to which I go. Bernard and Neville, Percival, Archie, Larpent and Baker go to Oxford or Cambridge, to Edinburgh, Rome, Paris, Berlin, or to some American University. I go vaguely, to make money vaguely. Therefore a poignant shadow, a keen accent, falls on these golden bristles, on these poppy-red fields, this flowing corn that never overflows its boundaries; but runs rippling to the edge. This is the first day of a new life, another spoke of the rising wheel. But my body passes vagrant as a bird's shadow. I should be transient as the shadow on the meadow, soon fading, soon darkening and dying there where it meets the wood, were it not that I coerce my brain to form in my forehead; I force myself to state, if only in one line of unwritten poetry, this moment; to mark this inch in the long, long history that began in Egypt, in the time of the Pharaohs, when women carried red pitchers to the Nile. I seem already to have lived many thousand years. But if I now shut my eyes, if I fail to realize the meeting-place of past and present, that I sit in a third-class railway carriage full of boys going home for the holidays, human history is defrauded of a moment's vision. Its eye, that would see through me, shuts--if I sleep now, through slovenliness, or cowardice, burying myself in the past, in the dark; or acquiesce, as Bernard acquiesces, telling stories; or boast, as Percival, Archie, John, Walter, Lathom, Larpent, Roper, Smith boast--the names are the same always, the names of the boasting boys. They are all boasting, all talking, except Neville, who slips a look occasionally over the edge of a French novel, and so will always slip into cushioned firelit rooms, with many books and one friend, while I tilt on an office chair behind a counter. Then I shall grow bitter and mock at them. I shall envy them their continuance down the safe traditional ways under the shade of old yew trees while I consort with cockneys and clerks, and tap the pavements of the city.", now we are off   said louis   now i hang suspended without attachments  we are nowhere  we are passing through england in a train  england slips by the window  always changing from hill to wood  from rivers and willows to towns again  and i have no firm ground to which i go  bernard and neville  percival  archie  larpent and baker go to oxford or cambridge  to edinburgh  rome  paris  berlin  or to some american university  i go vaguely  to make money vaguely  therefore a poignant shadow  a keen accent  falls on these golden bristles  on these poppy red fields  this flowing corn that never overflows its boundaries  but runs rippling to the edge  this is the first day of a new life  another spoke of the rising wheel  but my body passes vagrant as a bird own shadow  i should be transient as the shadow on the meadow  soon fading  soon darkening and dying there where it meets the wood  were it not that i coerce my brain to form in my forehead  i force myself to state  if only in one line of unwritten poetry  this moment  to mark this inch in the long  long history that began in egypt  in the time of the pharaohs  when women carried red pitchers to the nile  i seem already to have lived many thousand years  but if i now shut my eyes  if i fail to realize the meeting place of past and present  that i sit in a third class railway carriage full of boys going home for the holidays  human history is defrauded of a moment own vision  its eye  that would see through me  shuts  if i sleep now  through slovenliness  or cowardice  burying myself in the past  in the dark  or acquiesce  as bernard acquiesces  telling stories  or boast  as percival  archie  john  walter  lathom  larpent  roper  smith boast  the names are the same always  the names of the boasting boys  they are all boasting  all talking  except neville  who slips a look occasionally over the edge of a french novel  and so will always slip into cushioned firelit rooms  with many books and one friend  while i tilt on an office chair behind a counter  then i shall grow bitter and mock at them  i shall envy them their continuance down the safe traditional ways under the shade of old yew trees while i consort with cockneys and clerks  and tap the pavements of the city ,2248,402,0.49999999999999967,0.3429721574570295,0.32786885245901626,0.3429721574570295,0.23025353227046466,0.49999999999999967,0.3002715834204576,0.31775700934579426,0.3002715834204576,0.16863361611012992,-57.031115621422444,-0.4750502132847025,-0.49405823375071745,-0.4750502132847025,0.113734592134447,-3.4458333333333333,-1.345292117408307,-1.318525099955576,-1.345292117408307,-0.17736167452346574,-1.0149999999999995,-0.6375118085850645,-0.42397630960890426,-0.6375118085850645,-0.35154653059691576,12.48929421131421,0.4294902497392773,0.46543721190020176,0.4294902497392773,0.1296888425768029,-0.8178333259536953,-0.5974853312600364,-0.49460192138862225,-0.5974853312600364,-0.14767207485899106,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.0276}",-0.0276,-0.09996268076075018,-0.020706729687148324,-0.09996268076075018,-0.0074590854154981505,0.03031788472964943,-0.10732568662754834,-0.056343497992307215,-0.10732568662754834,-0.13779913688328607,0.12132181915590033,0.01449730479050042,0.16327941756211328,0.01449730479050042,-0.11814442458011705,67.88016605415672,2.446103259498366,1.810990811620381,2.446103259498366,-0.7131227846961204,-0.6361,-0.5548609249659552,0.04944577820912295,-0.5548609249659552,0.11737754997138564

133,133,10,"'Louis and Neville,' said Bernard, 'both sit silent. Both are absorbed. Both feel the presence of other people as a separating wall. But if I find myself in company with other people, words at once make smoke rings--see how phrases at once begin to wreathe off my lips. It seems that a match is set to a fire; something burns. An elderly and apparently prosperous man, a traveller, now gets in. And I at once wish to approach him; I instinctively dislike the sense of his presence, cold, unassimilated, among us. I do not believe in separation. We are not single. Also I wish to add to my collection of valuable observations upon the true nature of human life. My book will certainly run to many volumes, embracing every known variety of man and woman. I fill my mind with whatever happens to be the contents of a room or a railway carriage as one fills a fountain-pen in an inkpot. I have a steady unquenchable thirst. Now I feel by imperceptible signs, which I cannot yet interpret but will later, that his defiance is about to thaw. His solitude shows signs of cracking. He has passed a remark about a country house. A smoke ring issues from my lips (about crops) and circles him, bringing him into contact. The human voice has a disarming quality--(we are not single, we are one). As we exchange these few but amiable remarks about country houses, I furbish him up and make him concrete. He is indulgent as a husband but not faithful; a small builder who employs a few men. In local society he is important; is already a councillor, and perhaps in time will be mayor. He wears a large ornament, like a double tooth torn up by the roots, made of coral, hanging at his watch-chain. Walter J. Trumble is the sort of name that would fit him. He has been in America, on a business trip with his wife, and a double room in a smallish hotel cost him a whole month's wages.

Neville is repelled by the grossness of Trumble. Louis, glancing, tripping with the high step of a disdainful crane, picks up words as if in sugar-tongs.

I do not admire that man; he does not admire me. Let me at least be honest. Let me denounce this piffling, trifling, self-satisfied world; these horse-hair seats; these coloured photographs of piers and parades. I could shriek aloud at the smug self-satisfaction, at the mediocrity of this world, which breeds horse-dealers with coral ornaments hanging from their watch-chains. There is that in me which will consume them entirely. My laughter shall make them twist in their seats; shall drive them howling before me. No; they are immortal. They triumph. They will make it impossible for me always to read Catullus in a third-class railway carriage. They will drive me in October to take refuge in one of the universities, where I shall become a don; and go with schoolmasters to Greece; and lecture on the ruins of the Parthenon. It would be better to breed horses and live in one of those red villas than to run in and out of the skulls of Sophocles and Euripides like a maggot, with a high-minded wife, one of those University women.

145,145,12,"'The complexity of things becomes more close,' said Bernard, 'here at college, where the stir and pressure of life are so extreme, where the excitement of mere living becomes daily more urgent. Every hour something new is unburied in the great bran pie. What am I? I ask. This? No, I am that. Especially now, when I have left a room, and people talking, and the stone flags ring out with my solitary footsteps, and I behold the moon rising, sublimely, indifferently, over the ancient chapel--then it becomes clear that I am not one and simple, but complex and many. Bernard, in public, bubbles; in private, is secretive. That is what they do not understand, for they are now undoubtedly discussing me, saying I escape them, am evasive. They do not understand that I have to effect different transitions; have to cover the entrances and exits of several different men who alternately act their parts as Bernard. I am abnormally aware of circumstances. I can never read a book in a railway carriage without asking, Is he a builder? Is she unhappy? I was aware today acutely that poor Simes, with his pimple, was feeling, how bitterly, that his chance of making a good impression upon Billy Jackson was remote. Feeling this painfully, I invited him to dinner with ardour. This he will attribute to an admiration which is not mine. That is true. But ""joined to the sensibility of a woman"" (I am here quoting my own biographer) ""Bernard possessed the logical sobriety of a man."" Now people who make a single impression, and that, in the main, a good one (for there seems to be a virtue in simplicity), are those who keep their equilibrium in mid-stream. (I instantly see fish with their noses one way, the stream rushing past another.) Canon, Lycett, Peters, Hawkins, Larpent, Neville--all fish in mid-stream. But you understand, you, my self, who always comes at a call (that would be a harrowing experience to call and for no one to come; that would make the midnight hollow, and explains the expression of old men in clubs--they have given up calling for a self who does not come), you understand that I am only superficially represented by what I was saying tonight. Underneath, and, at the moment when I am most disparate, I am also integrated. I sympathize effusively; I also sit, like a toad in a hole, receiving with perfect coldness whatever comes. Very few of you who are now discussing me have the double capacity to feel, to reason. Lycett, you see, believes in running after hares; Hawkins has spent a most industrious afternoon in the library. Peters has his young lady at the circulating library.

I shall pass from the service for the man who was drowned (I have a phrase for that) to Mrs Moffat and her sayings (I have a note of them), and so to some reflections apparently casual but full of profundity (profound criticism is often written casually) about some book I have been reading, some out-of-the-way book. I want her to say as she brushes her hair or puts out the candle, ""Where did I read that? Oh, in Bernard's letter.""

In the courtyard of this shabby but distinguished house there are two or three dogs, slinking, long-legged. There are faded rugs in the hall; a military gentleman smokes a pipe as he paces the terrace. The note is of distinguished poverty and military connections. A hunter's hoof on the writing table--a favourite horse. ""Do you ride?"" ""Yes, sir, I love riding."" ""My daughter expects us in the drawing-room."" My heart pounds against my ribs. She is standing at a low table; she has been hunting; she munches sandwiches like a tomboy. I make a fairly good impression on the Colonel. I am not too clever, he thinks; I am not too raw. Also I play billiards. Then the nice maid who has been with the family thirty years comes in. The pattern on the plates is of Oriental long-tailed birds.

There was the morning, fine; there was the afternoon, walking. I like views of spires across grey fields. I like glimpses between people's shoulders. Things kept popping into my head. I was imaginative, subtle. After dinner, I was dramatic. I put into concrete form many things that we had dimly observed about our common friends. I made my transitions easily.

It is he who now takes the poker and rattles the cinders so that they fall in showers through the grate. ""Lord,"" he says to himself, watching them fall, ""what a pother!"" and then he adds, lugubriously, but with some sense of consolation, ""Mrs Moffat will come and sweep it all up--"" I fancy I shall often repeat to myself that phrase, as I rattle and bang through life, hitting first this side of the carriage, then the other, ""Oh, yes, Mrs Moffat will come and sweep it all up.""

152,152,12,"'In a world which contains the present moment,' said Neville, 'why discriminate? Nothing should be named lest by so doing we change it. Let it exist, this bank, this beauty, and I, for one instant, steeped in pleasure. The sun is hot. I see the river. I see trees specked and burnt in the autumn sunlight. Boats float past, through the red, through the green. Far away a bell tolls, but not for death. There are bells that ring for life. A leaf falls, from joy. Oh, I am in love with life! Look how the willow shoots its fine sprays into the air! Look how through them a boat passes, filled with indolent, with unconscious, with powerful young men. They are listening to the gramophone; they are eating fruit out of paper bags. They are tossing the skins of bananas, which then sink eel-like, into the river. All they do is beautiful. There are cruets behind them and ornaments; their rooms are full of oars and oleographs but they have turned all to beauty. That boat passes under the bridge. Another comes. Then another. That is Percival, lounging on the cushions, monolithic, in giant repose. No, it is only one of his satellites, imitating his monolithic, his giant repose. He alone is unconscious of their tricks, and when he catches them at it he buffets them good-humouredly with a blow of his paw. They, too, have passed under the bridge through 'the fountains of the pendant trees', through its fine strokes of yellow and plum colour. The breeze stirs; the curtain quivers; I see behind the leaves the grave, yet eternally joyous buildings, which seem porous, not gravid; light, though set so immemorially on the ancient turf. Now begins to rise in me the familiar rhythm; words that have lain dormant now lift, now toss their crests, and fall and rise, and fall and rise again. I am a poet, yes. Surely I am a great poet. Boats and youth passing and distant trees, ""the falling fountains of the pendant trees"". I see it all. I feel it all. I am inspired. My eyes fill with tears. Yet even as I feel this, I lash my frenzy higher and higher. It foams. It becomes artificial, insincere. Words and words and words, how they gallop--how they lash their long manes and tails, but for some fault in me I cannot give myself to their backs; I cannot fly with them, scattering women and string bags. There is some flaw in me--some fatal hesitancy, which, if I pass it over, turns to foam and falsity. Yet it is incredible that I should not be a great poet. What did I write last night if it was not good poetry? Am I too fast, too facile? I do not know.

My charm and flow of language, unexpected and spontaneous as it is, delights me too. I am astonished, as I draw the veil off things with words, how much, how infinitely more than I can say, I have observed. More and more bubbles into my mind as I talk, images and images.

I begin to suspect, when I am with you, that I am among the most gifted of men. I am filled with the delight of youth, with potency, with the sense of what is to come. Blundering, but fervid, I see myself buzzing round flowers, humming down scarlet cups, making blue funnels resound with my prodigious booming. How richly I shall enjoy my youth (you make me feel). And London. And freedom. But stop. You are not listening. You are making some protest, as you slide, with an inexpressibly familiar gesture, your hand along your knee.

The chorus, like a torrent jumping rocks, brutally assaulting old trees, pours with splendid abandonment headlong over precipices. On they roll; on they gallop, after hounds, after footballs; they pump up and down attached to oars like sacks of flour. All divisions are merged--they act like one man. The gusty October wind blows the uproar in bursts of sound and silence across the court. Now again they are smashing the china--that is the convention. An old, unsteady woman carrying a bag trots home under the fire-red windows. She is half afraid that they will fall on her and tumble her into the gutter.

Supple-faced, with rippling skins, that are always twitching with the multiplicity of their sensations, prehensile like monkeys, greased to this particular moment, they are discussing with all the right gestures the sale of a piano. It blocks up the hall; so he would take a Tenner. People go on passing; they go on passing against the spires of the church and the plates of ham sandwiches.

Words crowd and cluster and push forth one on top of another. It does not matter which. They jostle and mount on each other's shoulders. The single and the solitary mate, tumble and become many. It does not matter what I say. Crowding, like a fluttering bird, one sentence crosses the empty space between us. It settles on his lips. I fill my glass again. I drink. The veil drops between us. I am admitted to the warmth and privacy of another soul. We are together, high up, on some Alpine pass. He stands melancholy on the crest of the road. I stoop.

189,189,13,"'Night has wheeled a little further over the chimney-pots. I see out of the window over his shoulder some unembarrassed cat, not drowned in light, not trapped in silk, free to pause, to stretch, and to move again. I hate all details of the individual life. But I am fixed here to listen. An immense pressure is on me. I cannot move without dislodging the weight of centuries. A million arrows pierce me. Scorn and ridicule pierce me. I, who could beat my breast against the storm and let the hail choke me joyfully, am pinned down here; am exposed. The tiger leaps. Tongues with their whips are upon me. Mobile, incessant, they flicker over me. I must prevaricate and fence them off with lies. What amulet is there against this disaster? What face can I summon to lay cool upon this heat?

193,193,14,"In the garden where the trees stood, thick over flowerbeds, ponds, and greenhouses the birds sang in the hot sunshine, each alone. One sang under the bedroom window; another on the topmost twig of the lilac bush; another on the edge of the wall. Each sang stridently, with passion, with vehemence, as if to let the song burst out of it, no matter if it shattered the song of another bird with harsh discord. Their round eyes bulged with brightness; their claws gripped the twig or rail. They sang, exposed without shelter, to the air and the sun, beautiful in their new plumage, shell-veined or brightly mailed, here barred with soft blues, here splashed with gold, or striped with one bright feather. They sang as if the song were urged out of them by the pressure of the morning. They sang as if the edge of being were sharpened and must cut, must split the softness of the blue-green light, the dampness of the wet earth; the fumes and steams of the greasy kitchen vapour; the hot breath of mutton and beef; the richness of pastry and fruit; the damp shreds and peelings thrown from the kitchen bucket, from which a slow steam oozed on the rubbish heap. On all the sodden, the damp-spotted, the curled with wetness, they descended, dry-beaked, ruthless, abrupt. They swooped suddenly from the lilac bough or the fence. They spied a snail and tapped the shell against a stone. They tapped furiously, methodically, until the shell broke and something slimy oozed from the crack.

The veins on the glaze of the china, the grain of the wood, the fibres of the matting became more and more finely engraved. Everything was without shadow.

197,197,15,"'Having dropped off satisfied like a child from the breast, I am at liberty now to sink down, deep, into what passes, this omnipresent, general life. (How much, let me note, depends upon trousers; the intelligent head is entirely handicapped by shabby trousers.) One observes curious hesitations at the door of the lift. This way, that way, the other? Then individuality asserts itself. They are off. They are all impelled by some necessity. Some miserable affair of keeping an appointment, of buying a hat, severs these beautiful human beings once so united. For myself, I have no aim. I have no ambition. I will let myself be carried on by the general impulse. The surface of my mind slips along like a pale-grey stream, reflecting what passes. I cannot remember my past, my nose, or the colour of my eyes, or what my general opinion of myself is. Only in moments of emergency, at a crossing, at a kerb, the wish to preserve my body springs out and seizes me and stops me, here, before this omnibus. We insist, it seems, on living. Then again, indifference descends. The roar of the traffic, the passage of undifferentiated faces, this way and that way, drugs me into dreams; rubs the features from faces. People might walk through me. And, what is this moment of time, this particular day in which I have found myself caught?

200,200,15,"'Yet behold, it returns. One cannot extinguish that persistent smell. It steals in through some crack in the structure--one's identity. I am not part of the street--no, I observe the street. One splits off, therefore. For instance, up that back street a girl stands waiting; for whom? A romantic story. On the wall of that shop is fixed a small crane, and for what reason, I ask, was that crane fixed there? and invent a purple lady swelling, circumambient, hauled from a barouche landau by a perspiring husband sometime in the sixties. A grotesque story. That is, I am a natural coiner of words, a blower of bubbles through one thing and another. And, striking off these observations spontaneously, I elaborate myself; differentiate myself and, listening to the voice that says as I stroll past, ""Look! Take note of that!"" I conceive myself called upon to provide, some winter's night, a meaning for all my observations--a line that runs from one to another, a summing up that completes. But soliloquies in back streets soon pall. I need an audience. That is my downfall. That always ruffles the edge of the final statement and prevents it from forming. I cannot seat myself in some sordid eating-house and order the same glass day after day and imbue myself entirely in one fluid--this life. I make my phrase and run off with it to some furnished room where it will be lit by dozens of candles. I need eyes on me to draw out these frills and furbelows. To be myself (I note) I need the illumination of other people's eyes, and therefore cannot be entirely sure what is my self. The authentics, like Louis, like Rhoda, exist most completely in solitude.

201,201,15,"'I wish, then, after this somnolence to sparkle, many-faceted under the light of my friends' faces. I have been traversing the sunless territory of non-identity. A strange land. I have heard in my moment of appeasement, in my moment of obliterating satisfaction, the sigh, as it goes in, comes out, of the tide that draws beyond this circle of bright light, this drumming of insensate fury. I have had one moment of enormous peace. This perhaps is happiness. Now I am drawn back by pricking sensations; by curiosity, greed (I am hungry) and the irresistible desire to be myself. I think of people to whom I could say things: Louis, Neville, Susan, Jinny and Rhoda. With them I am many-sided. They retrieve me from darkness. We shall meet tonight, thank Heaven. Thank Heaven, I need not be alone. We shall dine together. We shall say good-bye to Percival, who goes to India. The hour is still distant, but I feel already those harbingers, those outriders, figures of one's friends in absence. I see Louis, stone-carved, sculpturesque; Neville, scissor-cutting, exact; Susan with eyes like lumps of crystal; Jinny dancing like a flame, febrile, hot, over dry earth; and Rhoda the nymph of the fountain always wet. These are fantastic pictures--these are figments, these visions of friends in absence, grotesque, dropsical, vanishing at the first touch of the toe of a real boot. Yet they drum me alive. They brush off these vapours. I begin to be impatient of solitude--to feel its draperies hang sweltering, unwholesome about me. Oh, to toss them off and be active! Anybody will do. I am not fastidious. The crossing-sweeper will do; the postman; the waiter in this French restaurant; better still the genial proprietor, whose geniality seems reserved for oneself. He mixes the salad with his own hands for some privileged guest. Which is the privileged guest, I ask, and why? And what is he saying to the lady in ear-rings; is she a friend or a customer? I feel at once, as I sit down at a table, the delicious jostle of confusion, of uncertainty, of possibility, of speculation. Images breed instantly. I am embarrassed by my own fertility. I could describe every chair, table, luncher here copiously, freely. My mind hums hither and thither with its veil of words for everything. To speak, about wine even to the waiter, is to bring about an explosion. Up goes the rocket. Its golden grain falls, fertilizing, upon the rich soil of my imagination. The entirely unexpected nature of this explosion--that is the joy of intercourse. I, mixed with an unknown Italian waiter--what am I? There is no stability in this world.

I have taken my place at the table ten minutes before the time in order to taste every moment of anticipation; to see the door open and to say, ""Is it Percival? No; it is not Percival."" There is a morbid pleasure in saying: ""No, it is not Percival."" I have seen the door open and shut twenty times already; each time the suspense sharpens. This is the place to which he is coming. This is the table at which he will sit. Here, incredible as it seems, will be his actual body. This table, these chairs, this metal vase with its three red flowers are about to undergo an extraordinary transformation. Already the room, with its swing-doors, its tables heaped with fruit, with cold joints, wears the wavering, unreal appearance of a place where one waits expecting something to happen. Things quiver as if not yet in being. The blankness of the white table-cloth glares. The hostility, the indifference of other people dining here is oppressive. We look at each other; see that we do not know each other, stare, and go off. Such looks are lashes. I feel the whole cruelty and indifference of the world in them. If he should not come I could not bear it. I should go. Yet somebody must be seeing him now. He must be in some cab; he must be passing some shop. And every moment he seems to pump into this room this prickly light, this intensity of being, so that things have lost their normal uses--this knife-blade is only a flash of light, not a thing to cut with.

But I cannot, for I am not single and entire as you are. I have lived a thousand lives already. Every day I unbury--I dig up. I find relics of myself in the sand that women made thousands of years ago, when I heard songs by the Nile and the chained beast stamping. What you see beside you, this man, this Louis, is only the cinders and refuse of something once splendid. I was an Arab prince; behold my free gestures. I was a great poet in the time of Elizabeth. I was a Duke at the court of Louis the Fourteenth. I am very vain, very confident; I have an immeasurable desire that women should sigh in sympathy. I have eaten no lunch today in order that Susan may think me cadaverous and that Jinny may extend to me the exquisite balm of her sympathy.

237,237,15,"'But when you stand in the door,' said Neville, 'you inflict stillness, demanding admiration, and that is a great impediment to the freedom of intercourse. You stand in the door making us notice you. But none of you saw me approach. I came early; I came quickly and directly, here, to sit by the person whom I love. My life has a rapidity that yours lack. I am like a hound on the scent. I hunt from dawn to dusk. Nothing, not the pursuit of perfection through the sand, nor fame, nor money, has meaning for me. I shall have riches; I shall have fame. But I shall never have what I want, for I lack bodily grace and the courage that comes with it. The swiftness of my mind is too strong for my body. I fail before I reach the end and fall in a heap, damp, perhaps disgusting. I excite pity in the crises of life, not love. Therefore I suffer horribly. But I do not suffer, as Louis does, to make myself a spectacle. I have too fine a sense of fact to allow myself these juggleries, these pretences. I see everything--except one thing--with complete clarity. That is my saving. That is what gives my suffering an unceasing excitement. That is what makes me dictate, even when I am silent. And since I am, in one respect, deluded, since the person is always changing, though not the desire, and I do not know in the morning by whom I shall sit at night, I am never stagnant; I rise from my worst disasters, I turn, I change. Pebbles bounce off the mail of my muscular, my extended body.

I am afraid of the shock of sensation that leaps upon me, because I cannot deal with it as you do--I cannot make one moment merge in the next. To me they are all violent, all separate; and if I fall under the shock of the leap of the moment you will be on me, tearing me to pieces. I have no end in view. I do not know how to run minute to minute and hour to hour, solving them by some natural force until they make the whole and indivisible mass that you call life. Because you have an end in view--one person, is it, to sit beside, an idea is it, your beauty is it? I do not know--your days and hours pass like the boughs of forest trees and the smooth green of forest rides to a hound running on the scent.

240,240,15,"'When I came into the room tonight,' said Susan, 'I stopped, I peered about like an animal with its eyes near to the ground. The smell of carpets and furniture and scent disgusts me. I like to walk through the wet fields alone, or to stop at a gate and watch my setter nose in a circle, and to ask: Where is the hare? I like to be with people who twist herbs, and spit into the fire, and shuffle down long passages in slippers like my father. The only sayings I understand are cries of love, hate, rage and pain. This talking is undressing an old woman whose dress had seemed to be part of her, but now, as we talk, she turns pinkish underneath, and has wrinkled thighs and sagging breasts. When you are silent you are again beautiful. I shall never have anything but natural happiness. It will almost content me. I shall go to bed tired. I shall lie like a field bearing crops in rotation; in the summer heat will dance over me; in the winter I shall be cracked with the cold. But heat and cold will follow each other naturally without my willing or unwilling. My children will carry me on; their teething, their crying, their going to school and coming back will be like the waves of the sea under me. No day will be without its movement. I shall be lifted higher than any of you on the backs of the seasons. I shall possess more than Jinny, more than Rhoda, by the time I die. But on the other hand, where you are various and dimple a million times to the ideas and laughter of others, I shall be sullen, storm-tinted and all one purple. I shall be debased and hide-bound by the bestial and beautiful passion of maternity. I shall push the fortunes of my children unscrupulously. I shall hate those who see their faults. I shall lie basely to help them. I shall let them wall me away from you, from you and from you. Also, I am torn with jealousy. I hate Jinny because she shows me that my hands are red, my nails bitten. I love with such ferocity that it kills me when the object of my love shows by a phrase that he can escape. He escapes, and I am left clutching at a string that slips in and out among the leaves on the tree-tops.

241,241,15,"'Had I been born,' said Bernard, 'not knowing that one word follows another I might have been, who knows, perhaps anything. As it is, finding sequences everywhere, I cannot bear the pressure of solitude. When I cannot see words curling like rings of smoke round me I am in darkness--I am nothing. When I am alone I fall into lethargy, and say to myself dismally as I poke the cinders through the bars of the grate, Mrs Moffat will come. She will come and sweep it all up. When Louis is alone he sees with astonishing intensity, and will write some words that may outlast us all. Rhoda loves to be alone. She fears us because we shatter the sense of being which is so extreme in solitude--see how she grasps her fork--her weapon against us. But I only come into existence when the plumber, or the horse-dealer, or whoever it may be, says something which sets me alight. Then how lovely the smoke of my phrase is, rising and falling, flaunting and falling, upon red lobsters and yellow fruit, wreathing them into one beauty. But observe how meretricious the phrase is--made up of what evasions and old lies. Thus my character is in part made of the stimulus which other people provide, and is not mine, as yours are. There is some fatal streak, some wandering and irregular vein of silver, weakening it. Hence the fact that used to enrage Neville at school, that I left him. I went with the boasting boys with little caps and badges, driving off in big brakes--there are some here tonight, dining together, correctly dressed, before they go off in perfect concord to the music hall; I loved them. For they bring me into existence as certainly as you do. Hence, too, when I am leaving you and the train is going, you feel that it is not the train that is going, but I, Bernard, who does not care, who does not feel, who has no ticket, and has lost perhaps his purse. Susan, staring at the string that slips in and out among the leaves of the beech trees, cries: ""He is gone! He has escaped me!"" For there is nothing to lay hold of.

247,247,15,"'I see India,' said Bernard. 'I see the low, long shore; I see the tortuous lanes of stamped mud that lead in and out among ramshackle pagodas; I see the gilt and crenellated buildings which have an air of fragility and decay as if they were temporarily run up buildings in some Oriental exhibition. I see a pair of bullocks who drag a low cart along the sun-baked road. The cart sways incompetently from side to side. Now one wheel sticks in the rut, and at once innumerable natives in loin-cloths swarm round it, chattering excitedly. But they do nothing. Time seems endless, ambition vain. Over all broods a sense of the uselessness of human exertion. There are strange sour smells. An old man in a ditch continues to chew betel and to contemplate his navel.

270,270,15,"'But soon, too soon,' said Bernard, 'this egotistic exultation fails. Too soon the moment of ravenous identity is over, and the appetite for happiness, and happiness, and still more happiness is glutted. The stone is sunk; the moment is over. Round me there spreads a wide margin of indifference. Now open in my eyes a thousand eyes of curiosity. Anyone now is at liberty to murder Bernard, who is engaged to be married, so long as they leave untouched this margin of unknown territory, this forest of the unknown world. Why, I ask (whispering discreetly), do women dine alone together there? Who are they? And what has brought them on this particular evening to this particular spot? The youth in the corner, judging from the nervous way in which he puts his hand from time to time to the back of his head, is from the country. He is suppliant, and so anxious to respond suitably to the kindness of his father's friend, his host, that he can scarcely enjoy now what he will enjoy very much at about half-past eleven tomorrow morning. I have also seen that lady powder her nose three times in the midst of an absorbing conversation--about love, perhaps, about the unhappiness of their dearest friend perhaps. ""Ah, but the state of my nose!"" she thinks, and out comes her powder-puff, obliterating in its passage all the most fervent feelings of the human heart. There remains, however, the insoluble problem of the solitary man with the eyeglass; of the elderly lady drinking champagne alone. Who and what are these unknown people? I ask. I could make a dozen stories of what he said, of what she said--I can see a dozen pictures. But what are stories? Toys I twist, bubbles I blow, one ring passing through another. And sometimes I begin to doubt if there are stories. What is my story? What is Rhoda's? What is Neville's? There are facts, as, for example: ""The handsome young man in the grey suit, whose reserve contrasted so strangely with the loquacity of the others, now brushed the crumbs from his waistcoat and, with a characteristic gesture at once commanding and benign, made a sign to the waiter, who came instantly and returned a moment later with the bill discreetly folded upon a plate.""

Now the sun burnt uncompromising, undeniable. It struck upon the hard sand, and the rocks became furnaces of red heat; it searched each pool and caught the minnow hiding in the cranny, and showed the rusty cartwheel, the white bone, or the boot without laces stuck, black as iron, in the sand. It gave to everything its exact measure of colour; to the sandhills their innumerable glitter, to the wild grasses their glancing green; or it fell upon the arid waste of the desert, here wind-scourged into furrows, here swept into desolate cairns, here sprinkled with stunted dark-green jungle trees. It lit up the smooth gilt mosque, the frail pink-and-white card houses of the southern village, and the long-breasted, white-haired women who knelt in the river bed beating wrinkled cloths upon stones. Steamers thudding slowly over the sea were caught in the level stare of the sun, and it beat through the yellow awnings upon passengers who dozed or paced the deck, shading their eyes to look for the land, while day after day, compressed in its oily throbbing sides, the ship bore them on monotonously over the waters.",the sun had risen to its full height  it was no longer half seen and guessed at  from hints and gleams  as if a girl couched on her green sea mattress tired her brows with water globed jewels that sent lances of opal tinted light falling and flashing in the uncertain air like the flanks of a dolphin leaping  or the flash of a falling blade  now the sun burnt uncompromising  undeniable  it struck upon the hard sand  and the rocks became furnaces of red heat  it searched each pool and caught the minnow hiding in the cranny  and showed the rusty cartwheel  the white bone  or the boot without laces stuck  black as iron  in the sand  it gave to everything its exact measure of colour  to the sandhills their innumerable glitter  to the wild grasses their glancing green  or it fell upon the arid waste of the desert  here wind scourged into furrows  here swept into desolate cairns  here sprinkled with stunted dark green jungle trees  it lit up the smooth gilt mosque  the frail pink and white card houses of the southern village  and the long breasted  white haired women who knelt in the river bed beating wrinkled cloths upon stones  steamers thudding slowly over the sea were caught in the level stare of the sun  and it beat through the yellow awnings upon passengers who dozed or paced the deck  shading their eyes to look for the land  while day after day  compressed in its oily throbbing sides  the ship bore them on monotonously over the waters ,1459,252,-7.35,-2.1377183829279853,-2.245901639344262,-2.1377183829279853,-0.721781224890673,-7.35,-2.3351196757799433,-2.6168224299065423,-2.3351196757799433,-0.8678978706226662,-274.2012954963333,-3.9660095680690928,-3.9615154242898964,-3.9660095680690928,-1.402779283036327,-3.718749999999999,-1.470409693087294,-1.4349178143047536,-1.470409693087294,-0.44565343939112695,-6.2120000000000015,-1.6919994497739066,-1.4853466761972842,-1.6919994497739066,-0.8707138739684265,12.84973740057582,0.44383847890954664,0.4788698102696406,0.44383847890954664,0.2128553070008354,-2.1184494250364505,-1.5106541535503177,-1.281176888659799,-1.5106541535503177,-0.6102070007400922,"{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.026, 'compound': -0.9129}",-0.9129,-1.4066200585772897,-0.6848975917173081,-1.4066200585772897,-0.3935729279495804,-0.04021739130434784,-0.5379771869306884,-0.44757056703003456,-0.5379771869306884,-0.33686916127461414,-0.1659335570437449,-0.9899032930890457,-0.785202829932357,-0.9899032930890457,-0.5039415676640193,45.19358773411094,1.0840268389579346,0.8528831837729893,1.0840268389579346,-0.5258759452918054,-0.981,-0.9311611880880274,-0.12673034683557236,-0.9311611880880274,-0.033923927165044665

It beat on the orchard wall, and every pit and grain of the brick was silver pointed, purple, fiery as if soft to touch, as if touched it must melt into hot-baked grains of dust.

From this moment I am solitary. No one will know me now. I have three letters, ""I am about to play quoits with a colonel, so no more,"" thus he ends our friendship, shouldering his way through the crowd with a wave of his hand. This farce is worth no more formal celebration.

298,298,17,"'Behold, then, the blue madonna streaked with tears. This is my funeral service. We have no ceremonies, only private dirges and no conclusions, only violent sensations, each separate. Nothing that has been said meets our case. We sit in the Italian room at the National Gallery picking up fragments. I doubt that Titian ever felt this rat gnaw. Painters live lives of methodical absorption, adding stroke to stroke. They are not like poets--scapegoats; they are not chained to the rock. Hence the silence, the sublimity. Yet that crimson must have burnt in Titian's gizzard. No doubt he rose with the great arms holding the cornucopia, and fell, in that descent. But the silence weighs on me--the perpetual solicitation of the eye. The pressure is intermittent and muffled. I distinguish too little and too vaguely.

Bernard, meanwhile, flops red-eyed into some arm-chair. He will have out his notebook; under D, he will enter ""Phrases to be used on the deaths of friends"".

But to sit with you, alone with you, here in London, in this firelit room, you there, I here, is all. The world ransacked to its uttermost ends, and all its heights stripped and gathered of their flowers, holds no more. Look at the firelight running up and down the gold thread in the curtain. The fruit it circles droops heavy.

Anyhow, I heard voices, a sob on the stair late at night. It is the end of their relationship. Thus we spin round us infinitely fine filaments and construct a system. Plato and Shakespeare are included, also quite obscure people, people of no importance whatsoever. I hate men who wear crucifixes on the left side of their waistcoats. I hate ceremonies and lamentations and the sad figure of Christ trembling beside another trembling and sad figure. Also the pomp and the indifference and the emphasis, always on the wrong place, of people holding forth under chandeliers in full evening dress, wearing stars and decorations. Some spray in a hedge, though, or a sunset over a flat winter field, or again the way some old woman sits, arms akimbo, in an omnibus with a basket--those we point at for the other to look at. It is so vast an alleviation to be able to point for another to look at. And then not to talk. To follow the dark paths of the mind and enter the past, to visit books, to brush aside their branches and break off some fruit.

I want this fire, I want this chair. I want someone to sit beside me after the day's pursuit and all its anguish, after its listenings, and its waitings, and its suspicions. After quarrelling and reconciliation I need privacy--to be alone with you, to set this hubbub in order. For I am as neat as a cat in my habits. We must oppose the waste and deformity of the world, its crowds eddying round and round disgorged and trampling. One must slip paper-knives, even, exactly through the pages of novels, and tie up packets of letters neatly with green silk, and brush up the cinders with a hearth broom. Everything must be done to rebuke the horror of deformity. Let us read writers of Roman severity and virtue; let us seek perfection through the sand. Yes, but I love to slip the virtue and severity of the noble Romans under the grey light of your eyes, and dancing grasses and summer breezes and the laughter and shouts of boys at play--of naked cabin-boys squirting each other with hosepipes on the decks of ships. Hence I am not a disinterested seeker, like Louis, after perfection through the sand. Colours always stain the page; clouds pass over it. And the poem, I think, is only your voice speaking.

They did not wrinkle their noses and scratch their foreheads with your precise gesture. You are you.

354,354,21,"'The truth is that I am not one of those who find their satisfaction in one person, or in infinity. The private room bores me, also the sky. My being only glitters when all its facets are exposed to many people. Let them fail and I am full of holes, dwindling like burnt paper. Oh, Mrs Moffat, Mrs Moffat, I say, come and sweep it all up. Things have dropped from me. I have outlived certain desires; I have lost friends, some by death--Percival--others through sheer inability to cross the street. I am not so gifted as at one time seemed likely. Certain things lie beyond my scope. I shall never understand the harder problems of philosophy. Rome is the limit of my travelling. As I drop asleep at night it strikes me sometimes with a pang that I shall never see savages in Tahiti spearing fish by the light of a blazing cresset, or a lion spring in the jungle, or a naked man eating raw flesh. Nor shall I learn Russian or read the Vedas. I shall never again walk bang into the pillar-box. (But still a few stars fall through my night, beautifully, from the violence of that concussion.)

It is not enough for them, this ordinary scene. It is not enough to wait for the thing to be said as if it were written; to see the sentence lay its dab of clay precisely on the right place, making character; to perceive, suddenly, some group in outline against the sky. Yet if they want violence, I have seen death and murder and suicide all in one room. One comes in, one goes out. There are sobs on the staircase. I have heard threads broken and knots tied and the quiet stitching of white cambric going on and on on the knees of a woman. Why ask, like Louis, for a reason, or fly like Rhoda to some far grove and part the leaves of the laurels and look for statues? They say that one must beat one's wings against the storm in the belief that beyond this welter the sun shines; the sun falls sheer into pools that are fledged with willows. (Here it is November; the poor hold out matchboxes in wind-bitten fingers.) They say truth is to be found there entire, and virtue, that shuffles along here, down blind alleys, is to be had there perfect. Rhoda flies with her neck outstretched and blind fanatic eyes, past us.

The page is often corrupt and mud-stained, and torn and stuck together with faded leaves, with scraps of verbena or geranium. To read this poem one must have myriad eyes, like one of those lamps that turn on slabs of racing water at midnight in the Atlantic, when perhaps only a spray of seaweed pricks the surface, or suddenly the waves gape and up shoulders a monster. One must put aside antipathies and jealousies and not interrupt. One must have patience and infinite care and let the light sound, whether of spiders' delicate feet on a leaf or the chuckle of water in some irrelevant drain-pipe, unfold too. Nothing is to be rejected in fear or horror. The poet who has written this page (what I read with people talking) has withdrawn. There are no commas or semi-colons. The lines do not run in convenient lengths. Much is sheer nonsense. One must be sceptical, but throw caution to the winds and when the door opens accept absolutely.

The fruit on the curtain swells beneath the parrot's beak. Cheep, cheep, creaks the fire, like the cheep of insects in the middle of a forest.

388,388,21,"'What has my destiny been, the sharp-pointed pyramid that has pressed on my ribs all these years? That I remember the Nile and the women carrying pitchers on their heads; that I feel myself woven in and out of the long summers and winters that have made the corn flow and have frozen the streams. I am not a single and passing being. My life is not a moment's bright spark like that on the surface of a diamond. I go beneath ground tortuously, as if a warder carried a lamp from cell to cell. My destiny has been that I remember and must weave together, must plait into one cable the many threads, the thin, the thick, the broken, the enduring of our long history, of our tumultuous and varied day.

How you have nudged, how you have interrupted, how hideous you have looked in Oxford Street, how squalid sitting opposite each other staring in the Tube! Now as I climb this mountain, from the top of which I shall see Africa, my mind is printed with brown-paper parcels and your faces. I have been stained by you and corrupted. You smelt so unpleasant too, lining up outside doors to buy tickets. All were dressed in indeterminate shades of grey and brown, never even a blue feather pinned to a hat. None had the courage to be one thing rather than another. What dissolution of the soul you demanded in order to get through one day, what lies, bowings, scrapings, fluency and servility!

412,412,23,"'You meanwhile--for I want to diminish your hostility, your green eyes fixed on mine, and your shabby dress, your rough hands, and all the other emblems of your maternal splendour--have stuck like a limpet to the same rock. Yet it is true, I do not want to hurt you; only to refresh and furbish up my own belief in myself that failed at your entry. Change is no longer possible. We are committed. Before, when we met in a restaurant in London with Percival, all simmered and shook; we could have been anything. We have chosen now, or sometimes it seems the choice was made for us--a pair of tongs pinched us between the shoulders. I chose. I took the print of life not outwardly, but inwardly upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre. I am clouded and bruised with the print of minds and faces and things so subtle that they have smell, colour, texture, substance, but no name. I am merely ""Neville"" to you, who see the narrow limits of my life and the line it cannot pass. But to myself I am immeasurable; a net whose fibres pass imperceptibly beneath the world. My net is almost indistinguishable from that which it surrounds. It lifts whales--huge leviathans and white jellies, what is amorphous and wandering; I detect, I perceive.

They escaped me. Yet look, Neville, whom I discredit in order to be myself, at my hand on the table. Look at the gradations of healthy colour here on the knuckles, here on the palm. My body has been used daily, rightly, like a tool by a good workman, all over. The blade is clean, sharp, worn in the centre. (We battle together like beasts fighting in a field, like stags making their horns clash.) Seen through your pale and yielding flesh, even apples and bunches of fruit must have a filmed look as if they stood under glass. Lying deep in a chair with one person, one person only, but one person who changes, you see one inch of flesh only; its nerves, fibres, the sullen or quick flow of blood on it; but nothing entire. You do not see a house in a garden; a horse in a field; a town laid out, as you bend like an old woman straining her eyes over her darning. But I have seen life in blocks, substantial, huge; its battlements and towers, factories and gasometers; a dwelling-place made from time immemorial after an hereditary pattern. These things remain square, prominent, undissolved in my mind.

417,417,23,"'It was different once,' said Bernard. 'Once we could break the current as we chose. How many telephone calls, how many post cards, are now needed to cut this hole through which we come together, united, at Hampton Court? How swift life runs from January to December! We are all swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shade; we make no comparisons; think scarcely ever of I or of you; and in this unconsciousness attain the utmost freedom from friction and part the weeds that grow over the mouths of sunken channels.

I make stories. I twist up toys out of anything. A girl sits at a cottage door; she is waiting; for whom? Seduced, or not seduced? The headmaster sees the hole in the carpet. He sighs. His wife, drawing her fingers through the waves of her still abundant hair, reflects--et cetera. Waves of hands, hesitations at street corners, someone dropping a cigarette into the gutter--all are stories. But which is the true story? That I do not know. Hence I keep my phrases hung like clothes in a cupboard, waiting for someone to wear them. Thus waiting, thus speculating, making this note and then another, I do not cling to life.

424,424,23,"'I see what is before me,' said Jinny. 'This scarf, these wine-coloured spots. This glass. This mustard pot. This flower. I like what one touches, what one tastes. I like rain when it has turned to snow and become palatable. And being rash, and much more courageous than you are, I do not temper my beauty with meanness lest it should scorch me. I gulp it down entire. It is made of flesh; it is made of stuff. My imagination is the body's. Its visions are not fine-spun and white with purity like Louis'. I do not like your lean cats and your blistered chimney-pots. The scrannel beauties of your roof-tops repel me. Men and women, in uniforms, wigs and gowns, bowler hats and tennis shirts beautifully open at the neck, the infinite variety of women's dresses (I note all clothes always) delight me. I eddy with them, in and out, in and out, into rooms, into halls, here, there, everywhere, wherever they go. This man lifts the hoof of a horse. This man shoves in and out the drawers of his private collection. I am never alone. I am attended by a regiment of my fellows. My mother must have followed the drum, my father the sea. I am like a little dog that trots down the road after the regimental band, but stops to snuff a tree-trunk, to sniff some brown stain, and suddenly careers across the street after some mongrel cur and then holds one paw up while it sniffs an entrancing whiff of meat from the butcher's shop. My traffics have led me into strange places. Men, how many, have broken from the wall and come to me. I have only to hold my hand up. Straight as a dart they have come to the place of assignation--perhaps a chair on a balcony, perhaps a shop at a street corner. The torments, the divisions of your lives have been solved for me night after night, sometimes only by the touch of a finger under the table-cloth as we sat dining--so fluid has my body become, forming even at the touch of a finger into one full drop, which fills itself, which quivers, which flashes, which falls in ecstasy.", i see what is before me   said jinny   this scarf  these wine coloured spots  this glass  this mustard pot  this flower  i like what one touches  what one tastes  i like rain when it has turned to snow and become palatable  and being rash  and much more courageous than you are  i do not temper my beauty with meanness lest it should scorch me  i gulp it down entire  it is made of flesh  it is made of stuff  my imagination is the body own  its visions are not fine spun and white with purity like louis   i do not like your lean cats and your blistered chimney pots  the scrannel beauties of your roof tops repel me  men and women  in uniforms  wigs and gowns  bowler hats and tennis shirts beautifully open at the neck  the infinite variety of women own dresses  i note all clothes always  delight me  i eddy with them  in and out  in and out  into rooms  into halls  here  there  everywhere  wherever they go  this man lifts the hoof of a horse  this man shoves in and out the drawers of his private collection  i am never alone  i am attended by a regiment of my fellows  my mother must have followed the drum  my father the sea  i am like a little dog that trots down the road after the regimental band  but stops to snuff a tree trunk  to sniff some brown stain  and suddenly careers across the street after some mongrel cur and then holds one paw up while it sniffs an entrancing whiff of meat from the butcher own shop  my traffics have led me into strange places  men  how many  have broken from the wall and come to me  i have only to hold my hand up  straight as a dart they have come to the place of assignation  perhaps a chair on a balcony  perhaps a shop at a street corner  the torments  the divisions of your lives have been solved for me night after night  sometimes only by the touch of a finger under the table cloth as we sat dining  so fluid has my body become  forming even at the touch of a finger into one full drop  which fills itself  which quivers  which flashes  which falls in ecstasy ,2011,372,6.949999999999999,2.381246550512233,2.4426229508196715,2.381246550512233,0.7762023510581004,5.949999999999999,2.129938126432201,2.3551401869158877,2.129938126432201,0.6714119010858044,100.74790945785784,2.061210353919014,2.0251274819978016,2.061210353919014,0.7751574761505289,-1.9229166666666697,-0.6471169431996064,-0.6690359840071095,-0.6471169431996064,-0.029769841442829206,4.187000000000003,0.4179903483255296,0.6384151945267034,0.4179903483255296,-0.02820370726997026,37.622189843892855,1.429960107381577,1.4020621862409448,1.429960107381577,0.4221744066775826,3.8028880522590884,2.6467453852825678,2.2998766102858412,2.6467453852825678,0.7420449733717288,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9643}",0.9643,1.3640308277179864,0.7234601245404757,1.3640308277179864,0.28162537192206993,0.1044312169312169,0.34517155304705627,0.3547294199028933,0.34517155304705627,0.03611379679701311,0.6492166565956161,1.8603039781300788,1.906323841933684,1.8603039781300788,0.461763566434993,65.14512576478612,2.281894543894564,1.6954836193612257,2.281894543894564,-0.6012199276683238,0.9997,1.2298649967942241,0.8850181335240334,1.2298649967942241,0.3969738455589264

I walked straight up to you instead of circling round to avoid the shock of sensation as I used. But it is only that I have taught my body to do a certain trick.

How tired I am of stories, how tired I am of phrases that come down beautifully with all their feet on the ground! Also, how I distrust neat designs of life that are drawn upon half-sheets of note-paper. I begin to long for some little language such as lovers use, broken words, inarticulate words, like the shuffling of feet on the pavement. I begin to seek some design more in accordance with those moments of humiliation and triumph that come now and then undeniably. Lying in a ditch on a stormy day, when it has been raining, then enormous clouds come marching over the sky, tattered clouds, wisps of cloud. What delights me then is the confusion, the height, the indifference and the fury.

474,474,25,"'In the beginning, there was the nursery, with windows opening on to a garden, and beyond that the sea. I saw something brighten--no doubt the brass handle of a cupboard. Then Mrs Constable raised the sponge above her head, squeezed it, and out shot, right, left, all down the spine, arrows of sensation. And so, as long as we draw breath, for the rest of time, if we knock against a chair, a table, or a woman, we are pierced with arrows of sensation--if we walk in a garden, if we drink this wine. Sometimes indeed, when I pass a cottage with a light in the window where a child has been born, I could implore them not to squeeze the sponge over that new body. Then, there was the garden and the canopy of the currant leaves which seemed to enclose everything; flowers, burning like sparks upon the depths of green; a rat wreathing with maggots under a rhubarb leaf; the fly going buzz, buzz, buzz upon the nursery ceiling, and plates upon plates of innocent bread and butter. All these things happen in one second and last for ever. Faces loom. Dashing round the corner. ""Hullo,"" one says, ""there's Jinny. That's Neville. That's Louis in grey flannel with a snake belt. That's Rhoda."" She had a basin in which she sailed petals of white flowers. It was Susan who cried, that day when I was in the tool-house with Neville; and I felt my indifference melt. Neville did not melt. ""Therefore,"" I said, ""I am myself, not Neville"", a wonderful discovery. Susan cried and I followed her. Her wet pocket-handkerchief, and the sight of her little back heaving up and down like a pump-handle, sobbing for what was denied her, screwed my nerves up. ""That is not to be borne,"" I said, as I sat beside her on the roots that were hard as skeletons. I then first became aware of the presence of those enemies who change, but are always there; the forces we fight against. To let oneself be carried on passively is unthinkable. ""That's your course, world,"" one says, ""mine is this."" So, ""Let's explore,"" I cried, and jumped up, and ran downhill with Susan and saw the stable-boy clattering about the yard in great boots. Down below, through the depths of the leaves, the gardeners swept the lawns with great brooms. The lady sat writing. Transfixed, stopped dead, I thought, ""I cannot interfere with a single stroke of those brooms. They sweep and they sweep. Nor with the fixity of that woman writing."" It is strange that one cannot stop gardeners sweeping nor dislodge a woman. There they have remained all my life. It is as if one had woken in Stonehenge surrounded by a circle of great stones, these enemies, these presences. Then a wood-pigeon flew out of the trees. And being in love for the first time, I made a phrase--a poem about a wood-pigeon--a single phrase, for a hole had been knocked in my mind, one of those sudden transparencies through which one sees everything. Then more bread and butter and more flies droning round the nursery ceiling on which quivered islands of light, ruffled, opalescent, while the pointed fingers of the lustre dripped blue pools on the corner of the mantelpiece.

477,477,25,"'Percival sat staring straight ahead of him that day in chapel. He also had a way of flicking his hand to the back of his neck. His movements were always remarkable. We all flicked our hands to the backs of our heads--unsuccessfully. He had the kind of beauty which defends itself from any caress. As he was not in the least precocious, he read whatever was written up for our edification without any comment, and thought with that magnificent equanimity (Latin words come naturally) that was to preserve him from so many meannesses and humiliations, that Lucy's flaxen pigtails and pink cheeks were the height of female beauty. Thus preserved, his taste later was of extreme fineness. But there should be music, some wild carol. Through the window should come a hunting-song from some rapid unapprehended life--a sound that shouts among the hills and dies away. What is startling, what is unexpected, what we cannot account for, what turns symmetry to nonsense--that comes suddenly to my mind, thinking of him. The little apparatus of observation is unhinged. Pillars go down; the Doctor floats off; some sudden exaltation possesses me. He was thrown, riding in a race, and when I came along Shaftesbury Avenue tonight, those insignificant and scarcely formulated faces that bubble up out of the doors of the Tube, and many obscure Indians, and people dying of famine and disease, and women who have been cheated, and whipped dogs and crying children--all these seemed to me bereft.

His being seemed conglobulated in his brow, his lips were pressed; his eyes were fixed, but suddenly they flashed with laughter. Also he suffered from chilblains, the penalty of an imperfect circulation. Unhappy, unfriended, in exile he would sometimes, in moments of confidence, describe how the surf swept over the beaches of his home. The remorseless eye of youth fixed itself upon his swollen joints. Yes, but we were also quick to perceive how cutting, how apt, how severe he was, how naturally, when we lay under the elm trees pretending to watch cricket, we waited his approval, seldom given. His ascendancy was resented, as Percival's was adored. Prim, suspicious, lifting his feet like a crane, there was yet a legend that he had smashed a door with his naked fist. But his peak was too bare, too stony for that kind of mist to cling to it. He was without those simple attachments by which one is connected with another. He remained aloof; enigmatic; a scholar capable of that inspired accuracy which has something formidable about it. My phrases (how to describe the moon) did not meet with his approval. On the other hand, he envied me to the point of desperation for being at my ease with servants. Not that the sense of his own deserts failed him. That was commensurate with his respect for discipline. Hence his success, finally. His life, though, was not happy. But look--his eye turns white as he lies in the palm of my hand.

He floated among us like a piece of thistledown, indolently haunting the sunny corner of the playing-field, not listening, yet not remote. It was through him that I have nosed round without ever precisely touching the Latin classics and have also derived some of those persistent habits of thought which make us irredeemably lop-sided--for instance about crucifixes, that they are the mark of the devil.

Nothing, nothing, nothing broke with its fin that leaden waste of waters. Nothing would happen to lift that weight of intolerable boredom. The terms went on. We grew; we changed; for, of course, we are animals. We are not always aware by any means; we breathe, eat, sleep automatically. We exist not only separately but in undifferentiated blobs of matter. With one scoop a whole brakeful of boys is swept up and goes cricketing, footballing. An army marches across Europe. We assemble in parks and halls and sedulously oppose any renegade (Neville, Louis, Rhoda) who sets up a separate existence. And I am so made that, while I hear one or two distinct melodies, such as Louis sings, or Neville, I am also drawn irresistibly to the sound of the chorus chanting its old, chanting its almost wordless, almost senseless song that comes across courts at night; which we hear now booming round us as cars and omnibuses take people to theatres. (Listen; the cars rush past this restaurant; now and then, down the river, a siren hoots, as a steamer makes for the sea.) If a bagman offers me snuff in a train I accept. I like the copious, shapeless, warm, not so very clever, but extremely easy and rather coarse aspect of things; the talk of men in clubs and public-houses, of miners half naked in drawers--the forthright, perfectly unassuming, and without end in view except dinner, love, money and getting along tolerably; that which is without great hopes, ideals or anything of that kind; what is unassuming except to make a tolerably good job of it.

I buried boxes of burnt matches in holes in the turf at his feet. His grim and caustic tongue reproved my indolence. He fascinated me with his sordid imagination. His heroes wore bowler-hats and talked about selling pianos for tenners. Through his landscape the tram squealed; the factory poured its acrid fumes. He haunted mean streets and towns where women lay drunk, naked, on counterpanes on Christmas day. His words falling from a shot-tower hit the water and up it spurted.

Not that I love music, but because the whole of life, its masters, its adventurers, then appeared in long ranks of magnificent human beings behind me; and I was the inheritor; I, the continuer; I, the person miraculously appointed to carry it on. So, swinging my stick, with my eyes filmed, not with pride, but with humility rather, I walked down the street.

People turned up in great quantities, not cut out, like the first faces (Neville, Louis, Jinny, Susan, Rhoda), but confused, featureless, or changed their features so fast that they seemed to have none. And blushing yet scornful, in the oddest condition of raw rapture and scepticism, I took the blow; the mixed sensations; the complex and disturbing and utterly unprepared for impacts of life all over, in all places, at the same time.

How humiliating never to be sure what to say next, and those painful silences, glaring as dry deserts, with every pebble apparent; and then to say what one ought not to have said, and then to be conscious of a ramrod of incorruptible sincerity which one would willingly exchange for a shower of smooth pence, but could not, there at that party, where Jinny sat quite at her ease, rayed out on a gilt chair.", i rose and walked away  i  i  i  not byron  shelley  dostoevsky  but i  bernard  i even repeated my own name once or twice  i went  swinging my stick  into a shop  and bought  not that i love music  a picture of beethoven in a silver frame  not that i love music  but because the whole of life  its masters  its adventurers  then appeared in long ranks of magnificent human beings behind me  and i was the inheritor  i  the continuer  i  the person miraculously appointed to carry it on  so  swinging my stick  with my eyes filmed  not with pride  but with humility rather  i walked down the street  the first whirr of wings had gone up  the carol  the exclamation  and now one enters  one goes into the house  the dry  uncompromising  inhabited house  the place with all its traditions  its objects  its accumulations of rubbish  and treasures displayed upon tables  i visited the family tailor  who remembered my uncle  people turned up in great quantities  not cut out  like the first faces  neville  louis  jinny  susan  rhoda   but confused  featureless  or changed their features so fast that they seemed to have none  and blushing yet scornful  in the oddest condition of raw rapture and scepticism  i took the blow  the mixed sensations  the complex and disturbing and utterly unprepared for impacts of life all over  in all places  at the same time  how upsetting  how humiliating never to be sure what to say next  and those painful silences  glaring as dry deserts  with every pebble apparent  and then to say what one ought not to have said  and then to be conscious of a ramrod of incorruptible sincerity which one would willingly exchange for a shower of smooth pence  but could not  there at that party  where jinny sat quite at her ease  rayed out on a gilt chair ,1781,309,5.0,1.765024059588567,1.80327868852459,1.765024059588567,0.697887893899439,4.0,1.4752867945289168,1.6261682242990654,1.4752867945289168,0.5674657921952967,44.49056179335092,1.1568867758942163,1.1268920760488057,1.1568867758942163,0.5718641073815116,6.324750000000001,3.133993499579254,2.848405153265217,3.133993499579254,1.0822926542665978,-0.4509999999999995,-0.5230744351714592,-0.3087919942816297,-0.5230744351714592,-0.3265494268218056,50.816225497526176,1.9551775421369693,1.8937629232430202,1.9551775421369693,0.6864907585294026,2.0537383968977005,1.4186589945925971,1.2420415320574794,1.4186589945925971,0.4824432892011962,"{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.91}",-0.91,-1.4023398073679054,-0.682721884612499,-1.4023398073679054,-0.31995246783658526,0.12355941549489942,0.46195832801587916,0.46082483032468313,0.46195832801587916,0.13703322239066348,0.6657986716326374,1.9182836965171646,1.9610756349144711,1.9182836965171646,0.6262780934726985,52.02803938807508,1.4943595614100755,1.1415181718016314,1.4943595614100755,-0.7217068737222063,0.5243,0.711183799089866,0.6421821525259234,0.711183799089866,0.3321055055938642

One finds oneself surprisingly supplied with information. Outside the undifferentiated forces roar; inside we are very private, very explicit, have a sense indeed, that it is here, in this little room, that we make whatever day of the week it may be. Friday or Saturday. A shell forms upon the soft soul, nacreous, shiny, upon which sensations tap their beaks in vain. On me it formed earlier than on most.

Faces recur, faces and faces--they press their beauty to the walls of my bubble--Neville, Susan, Louis, Jinny, Rhoda and a thousand others. How impossible to order them rightly; to detach one separately, or to give the effect of the whole--again like music. What a symphony with its concord and its discord, and its tunes on top and its complicated bass beneath, then grew up! Each played his own tune, fiddle, flute, trumpet, drum or whatever the instrument might be. With Neville, ""Let's discuss Hamlet."" With Louis, science. With Jinny, love. Then suddenly, in a moment of exasperation, off to Cumberland with a quiet man for a whole week in an inn, with the rain running down the window-panes and nothing but mutton and mutton and again mutton for dinner. Yet that week remains a solid stone in the welter of unrecorded sensation. It was then we played dominoes; then we quarrelled about tough mutton. Then we walked on the fell. And a little girl, peeping round the door, gave me that letter, written on blue paper, in which I learnt that the girl who had made me Byron was to marry a squire. A man in gaiters, a man with a whip, a man who made speeches about fat oxen at dinner--I exclaimed derisively and looked at the racing clouds, and felt my own failure; my desire to be free; to escape; to be bound; to make an end; to continue; to be Louis; to be myself; and walked out in my mackintosh alone, and felt grumpy under the eternal hills and not in the least sublime; and came home and blamed the meat and packed and so back again to the welter; to the torture.", the crystal  the globe of life as one calls it  far from being hard and cold to the touch  has walls of thinnest air  if i press them all will burst  whatever sentence i extract whole and entire from this cauldron is only a string of six little fish that let themselves be caught while a million others leap and sizzle  making the cauldron bubble like boiling silver  and slip through my fingers  faces recur  faces and faces  they press their beauty to the walls of my bubble  neville  susan  louis  jinny  rhoda and a thousand others  how impossible to order them rightly  to detach one separately  or to give the effect of the whole  again like music  what a symphony with its concord and its discord  and its tunes on top and its complicated bass beneath  then grew up  each played his own tune  fiddle  flute  trumpet  drum or whatever the instrument might be  with neville   let us discuss hamlet   with louis  science  with jinny  love  then suddenly  in a moment of exasperation  off to cumberland with a quiet man for a whole week in an inn  with the rain running down the window panes and nothing but mutton and mutton and again mutton for dinner  yet that week remains a solid stone in the welter of unrecorded sensation  it was then we played dominoes  then we quarrelled about tough mutton  then we walked on the fell  and a little girl  peeping round the door  gave me that letter  written on blue paper  in which i learnt that the girl who had made me byron was to marry a squire  a man in gaiters  a man with a whip  a man who made speeches about fat oxen at dinner  i exclaimed derisively and looked at the racing clouds  and felt my own failure  my desire to be free  to escape  to be bound  to make an end  to continue  to be louis  to be myself  and walked out in my mackintosh alone  and felt grumpy under the eternal hills and not in the least sublime  and came home and blamed the meat and packed and so back again to the welter  to the torture ,1968,359,0.5000000000000004,0.34297215745702975,0.32786885245901654,0.34297215745702975,0.23491741849816253,-0.49999999999999956,-0.03544704832481616,-0.056074766355140034,-0.03544704832481616,0.0787679404485094,0.0,0.44171150191520114,0.41653157217879583,0.44171150191520114,0.34110534632720774,3.3354166666666663,1.763545354615393,1.573522878720569,1.763545354615393,0.5974503827693814,3.851000000000002,0.34981489182380715,0.5697947513530077,0.34981489182380715,-0.04060118697955994,-25.15739511424417,-1.0691185242303498,-0.9375379939434899,-1.0691185242303498,-0.2925243298872567,-0.16666951800482185,-0.14030008801871519,-0.1007968998401611,-0.14030008801871519,-0.033699337046785065,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': -0.1406}",-0.1406,-0.2667448830574507,-0.10548428239177733,-0.2667448830574507,-0.04254939834750859,-0.012370005473453759,-0.367955615287378,-0.2931137937449578,-0.367955615287378,-0.23087037036388336,-0.06069989667632758,-0.6219493394035042,-0.43773410709116195,-0.6219493394035042,-0.3073246972569141,61.16771310776962,2.0430952010207943,1.5275081163116067,2.0430952010207943,-0.68584053358262,-0.9845,-0.934979833843108,-0.12851815906420802,-0.934979833843108,0.04141628035915542

496,496,25,"'However, since one must leap (to tell you this story), I leap, here, at this point, and alight now upon some perfectly commonplace object--say the poker and tongs, as I saw them sometime later, after that lady who had made me Byron had married, under the light of one whom I will call the third Miss Jones. She is the girl who wears a certain dress expecting one at dinner, who picks a certain rose, who makes one feel ""Steady, steady, this is a matter of some importance"", as one shaves. Then one asks, ""How does she behave to children?"" One observes that she is a little clumsy with her umbrella; but minded when the mole was caught in the trap; and finally, would not make the loaf at breakfast (I was thinking of the interminable breakfasts of married life as I shaved) altogether prosaic--it would not surprise one sitting opposite this girl to see a dragon-fly perched on the loaf at breakfast. Also she inspired me with a desire to rise in the world; also she made me look with curiosity at the hitherto repulsive faces of new-born babies.

When I came in, certain re-arrangements took place. ""Here's Bernard!"" How differently different people say that! There are many rooms--many Bernards. There was the charming, but weak; the strong, but supercilious; the brilliant, but remorseless; the very good fellow, but, I make no doubt, the awful bore; the sympathetic, but cold; the shabby, but--go into the next room--the foppish, worldly, and too well dressed. What I was to myself was different; was none of these. I am inclined to pin myself down most firmly there before the loaf at breakfast with my wife, who being now entirely my wife and not at all the girl who wore when she hoped to meet me a certain rose, gave me that feeling of existing in the midst of unconsciousness such as the tree-frog must have couched on the right shade of green leaf. ""Pass"" . . . I would say. ""Milk"" . . . she might answer, or ""Mary's coming"" . . . --simple words for those who have inherited the spoils of all the ages but not as said then, day after day, in the full tide of life, when one feels complete, entire, at breakfast. Muscles, nerves, intestines, blood-vessels, all that makes the coil and spring of our being, the unconscious hum of the engine, as well as the dart and flicker of the tongue, functioned superbly. Opening, shutting; shutting, opening; eating, drinking; sometimes speaking--the whole mechanism seemed to expand, to contract, like the mainspring of a clock. Toast and butter, coffee and bacon. The Times and letters--suddenly the telephone rang with urgency and I rose deliberately and went to the telephone. I took up the black mouth. I marked the ease with which my mind adjusted itself to assimilate the message--it might be (one has these fancies) to assume command of the British Empire; I observed my composure; I remarked with what magnificent vitality the atoms of my attention dispersed, swarmed round the interruption, assimilated the message, adapted themselves to a new state of affairs and had created, by the time I put back the receiver, a richer, stronger, a more complicated world in which I was called upon to act my part and had no doubt whatever that I could do it. Clapping my hat on my head, I strode into a world inhabited by vast numbers of men who had also clapped their hats on their heads, and as we jostled and encountered in trains and tubes we exchanged the knowing wink of competitors and comrades braced with a thousand snares and dodges to achieve the same end--to earn our livings.", i became  i mean  a certain kind of man  scoring my path across life as one treads a path across the fields  my boots became worn a little on the left side  when i came in  certain re arrangements took place   here is bernard   how differently different people say that  there are many rooms  many bernards  there was the charming  but weak  the strong  but supercilious  the brilliant  but remorseless  the very good fellow  but  i make no doubt  the awful bore  the sympathetic  but cold  the shabby  but  go into the next room  the foppish  worldly  and too well dressed  what i was to myself was different  was none of these  i am inclined to pin myself down most firmly there before the loaf at breakfast with my wife  who being now entirely my wife and not at all the girl who wore when she hoped to meet me a certain rose  gave me that feeling of existing in the midst of unconsciousness such as the tree frog must have couched on the right shade of green leaf   pass        i would say   milk        she might answer  or  mary own coming          simple words for those who have inherited the spoils of all the ages but not as said then  day after day  in the full tide of life  when one feels complete  entire  at breakfast  muscles  nerves  intestines  blood vessels  all that makes the coil and spring of our being  the unconscious hum of the engine  as well as the dart and flicker of the tongue  functioned superbly  opening  shutting  shutting  opening  eating  drinking  sometimes speaking  the whole mechanism seemed to expand  to contract  like the mainspring of a clock  toast and butter  coffee and bacon  the times and letters  suddenly the telephone rang with urgency and i rose deliberately and went to the telephone  i took up the black mouth  i marked the ease with which my mind adjusted itself to assimilate the message  it might be  one has these fancies  to assume command of the british empire  i observed my composure  i remarked with what magnificent vitality the atoms of my attention dispersed  swarmed round the interruption  assimilated the message  adapted themselves to a new state of affairs and had created  by the time i put back the receiver  a richer  stronger  a more complicated world in which i was called upon to act my part and had no doubt whatever that i could do it  clapping my hat on my head  i strode into a world inhabited by vast numbers of men who had also clapped their hats on their heads  and as we jostled and encountered in trains and tubes we exchanged the knowing wink of competitors and comrades braced with a thousand snares and dodges to achieve the same end  to earn our livings ,2644,466,6.05,2.0968361700859255,2.1475409836065573,2.0968361700859255,0.5977583172785056,10.45,3.6406719692859344,4.037383177570093,3.6406719692859344,0.8905857977907187,-13.984835018562851,0.21690858163724805,0.19324209122173733,0.21690858163724805,0.293008099325707,7.729949999999999,3.7782019295424174,3.447690804087073,3.7782019295424174,0.9139679536884129,33.46199999999998,6.357979899182432,6.617175533544366,6.357979899182432,1.3925896119243024,55.72547433079996,2.150600924828672,2.076715382431091,2.150600924828672,0.4991816683139551,3.199691412316612,2.223238121537189,1.9350807434228645,2.223238121537189,0.4984043284742949,"{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.986}",0.986,1.3960589143537245,0.7397404156350814,1.3960589143537245,0.22987595667038574,0.16168846200096199,0.6947543416736355,0.6723092952409353,0.6947543416736355,0.09222522089231487,1.258163603039936,3.9895127859071433,3.916992453291485,3.9895127859071433,0.8453324401440202,77.11256303683035,3.000405898607982,2.200896677883117,3.000405898607982,-0.7734670741743985,0.993,1.2225550177773556,0.8815957501149307,1.2225550177773556,0.36053446670954015

Active, energetic as a swarm of ants, I said, as I stood at the window and watched workers, bag in hand, stream into town. What hardness, what energy and violence of limb, I thought, seeing men in white drawers' scouring after a football on a patch of snow in January. Now being grumpy about some small matter--it might be the meat--it seemed luxurious to disturb with a little ripple the enormous stability, whose quiver, for our child was about to be born, increased its joy, of our married life. I snapped at dinner. I spoke unreasonably as if, being a millionaire, I could throw away five shillings; or, being a perfect steeple-jack, stumbled over a footstool on purpose.

501,501,25,"'Into this crashed death--Percival's. ""Which is happiness?"" I said (our child had been born), ""which pain?"" referring to the two sides of my body, as I came downstairs, making a purely physical statement. Also I made note of the state of the house; the curtain blowing; the cook singing; the wardrobe showing through the half-opened door. I said, ""Give him (myself) another moment's respite"" as I went downstairs. ""Now in this drawing-room he is going to suffer. There is no escape."" But for pain words are lacking. There should be cries, cracks, fissures, whiteness passing over chintz covers, interference with the sense of time, of space; the sense also of extreme fixity in passing objects; and sounds very remote and then very close; flesh being gashed and blood spurting, a joint suddenly twisted--beneath all of which appears something very important, yet remote, to be just held in solitude. So I went out. I saw the first morning he would never see--the sparrows were like toys dangled from a string by a child. To see things without attachment, from the outside, and to realize their beauty in itself--how strange! And then the sense that a burden has been removed; pretence and make-believe and unreality are gone, and lightness has come with a kind of transparency, making oneself invisible and things seen through as one walks--how strange. ""And now what other discovery will there be?"" I said, and in order to hold it tight ignored newspaper placards and went and looked at pictures. Madonnas and pillars, arches and orange trees, still as on the first day of creation, but acquainted with grief, there they hung, and I gazed at them. ""Here,"" I said, ""we are together without interruption."" This freedom, this immunity, seemed then a conquest, and stirred in me such exaltation that I sometimes go there, even now, to bring back exaltation and Percival. But it did not last. What torments one is the horrible activity of the mind's eye--how he fell, how he looked, where they carried him; men in loin-cloths, pulling ropes; the bandages and the mud. Then comes the terrible pounce of memory, not to be foretold, not to be warded off--that I did not go with him to Hampton Court. That claw scratched; that fang tore; I did not go. In spite of his impatiently protesting that it did not matter; why interrupt, why spoil our moment of uninterrupted community?--Still, I repeated sullenly, I did not go, and so, driven out of the sanctuary by these officious devils, went to Jinny because she had a room; a room with little tables, with little ornaments scattered on little tables. There I confessed, with tears--I had not gone to Hampton Court. And she, remembering other things, to me trifles but torturing to her, showed me how life withers when there are things we cannot share. Soon, too, a maid came in with a note, and as she turned to answer it and I felt my own curiosity to know what she was writing and to whom, I saw the first leaf fall on his grave. I saw us push beyond this moment, and leave it behind us for ever. And then sitting side by side on the sofa we remembered inevitably what had been said by others; ""the lily of the day is fairer far in May""; we compared Percival to a lily--Percival whom I wanted to lose his hair, to shock the authorities, to grow old with me; he was already covered with lilies.", into this crashed death  percival own   which is happiness   i said  our child had been born    which pain   referring to the two sides of my body  as i came downstairs  making a purely physical statement  also i made note of the state of the house  the curtain blowing  the cook singing  the wardrobe showing through the half opened door  i said   give him  myself  another moment own respite  as i went downstairs   now in this drawing room he is going to suffer  there is no escape   but for pain words are lacking  there should be cries  cracks  fissures  whiteness passing over chintz covers  interference with the sense of time  of space  the sense also of extreme fixity in passing objects  and sounds very remote and then very close  flesh being gashed and blood spurting  a joint suddenly twisted  beneath all of which appears something very important  yet remote  to be just held in solitude  so i went out  i saw the first morning he would never see  the sparrows were like toys dangled from a string by a child  to see things without attachment  from the outside  and to realize their beauty in itself  how strange  and then the sense that a burden has been removed  pretence and make believe and unreality are gone  and lightness has come with a kind of transparency  making oneself invisible and things seen through as one walks  how strange   and now what other discovery will there be   i said  and in order to hold it tight ignored newspaper placards and went and looked at pictures  madonnas and pillars  arches and orange trees  still as on the first day of creation  but acquainted with grief  there they hung  and i gazed at them   here   i said   we are together without interruption   this freedom  this immunity  seemed then a conquest  and stirred in me such exaltation that i sometimes go there  even now  to bring back exaltation and percival  but it did not last  what torments one is the horrible activity of the mind own eye  how he fell  how he looked  where they carried him  men in loin cloths  pulling ropes  the bandages and the mud  then comes the terrible pounce of memory  not to be foretold  not to be warded off  that i did not go with him to hampton court  that claw scratched  that fang tore  i did not go  in spite of his impatiently protesting that it did not matter  why interrupt  why spoil our moment of uninterrupted community   still  i repeated sullenly  i did not go  and so  driven out of the sanctuary by these officious devils  went to jinny because she had a room  a room with little tables  with little ornaments scattered on little tables  there i confessed  with tears  i had not gone to hampton court  and she  remembering other things  to me trifles but torturing to her  showed me how life withers when there are things we cannot share  soon  too  a maid came in with a note  and as she turned to answer it and i felt my own curiosity to know what she was writing and to whom  i saw the first leaf fall on his grave  i saw us push beyond this moment  and leave it behind us for ever  and then sitting side by side on the sofa we remembered inevitably what had been said by others   the lily of the day is fairer far in may   we compared percival to a lily  percival whom i wanted to lose his hair  to shock the authorities  to grow old with me  he was already covered with lilies ,3336,586,-15.3,-4.650010076693702,-4.852459016393443,-4.650010076693702,-0.6260641127449262,-12.3,-3.99692690291905,-4.4672897196261685,-3.99692690291905,-0.5891903633020149,-337.7503332657374,-4.987545342531456,-4.976173919725546,-4.987545342531456,-0.5826287162319745,-1.5510912698412676,-0.476655048017908,-0.5104609591504297,-0.476655048017908,0.07963454275192157,-2.5969999999999986,-0.9585045829473402,-0.7470642295517204,-0.9585045829473402,-0.3962896246914538,6.09684824039679,0.17502496233245302,0.2272106012058091,0.17502496233245302,0.04343087107459688,-4.152621324305816,-2.9388560333377525,-2.5113851693508886,-2.9388560333377525,-0.5143803150840196,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.9919}",-0.9919,-1.5232200053156908,-0.744166854227624,-1.5232200053156908,-0.1838962298498981,0.009160561660561653,-0.23650123444434956,-0.17369353840348994,-0.23650123444434956,-0.18844137228516525,0.13748580837843405,0.07101537819967428,0.21665094024376297,0.07101537819967428,-0.14513407574287576,93.0494778224081,3.9572401791842253,2.873950119658602,3.9572401791842253,-0.8929595935801943,-0.9991,-0.950909041850015,-0.13597589007508812,-0.950909041850015,0.1093485527466936

If a bird rose I should no longer make a poem--I should repeat what I had seen before. Thus if I had a stick with which to point to indentations in the curve of being, this is the lowest; here it coils useless on the mud where no tide comes--here, where I sit with my back to a hedge, and my hat over my eyes, while the sheep advanced remorselessly in that wooden way of theirs, step by step on stiff, pointed legs. But if you hold a blunt blade to a grindstone long enough, something spurts--a jagged edge of fire; so held to lack of reason, aimlessness, the usual, all massed together, out spurted in one flame hatred, contempt. I took my mind, my being, the old dejected, almost inanimate object, and lashed it about among these odds and ends, sticks and straws, detestable little bits of wreckage, flotsam and jetsam, floating on the oily surface. I jumped up. I said, ""Fight! Fight!"" I repeated.

With a shock of emotion one feels ""There are figures without features robed in beauty."" In the pause that follows while the ripples spread, the girl to whom one should be talking says to herself, ""He is old."" But she is wrong. It is not age; it is that a drop has fallen; another drop.

512,512,25,"'It was for this reason that instead of pulling on my patent-leather shoes and finding a tolerable tie, I sought Neville. I sought my oldest friend, who had known me when I was Byron; when I was Meredith's young man, and also that hero in a book by Dostoevsky whose name I have forgotten. I found him alone, reading. A perfectly neat table; a curtain pulled methodically straight; a paper-knife dividing a French volume--nobody, I thought, ever changes the attitude in which we saw them first, or the clothes. Here he has sat in this chair, in these clothes, ever since we first met. Here was freedom; here was intimacy; the firelight broke off some round apple on the curtain. There we talked; sat talking; sauntered down that avenue, the avenue which runs under the trees, under the thick-leaved murmuring trees, the trees that are hung with fruit, which we have trodden so often together, so that now the turf is bare round some of those trees, round certain plays and poems, certain favourites of ours--the turf is trodden bare by our incessant unmethodical pacing. If I have to wait, I read; if I wake in the night, I feel along the shelf for a book. Swelling, perpetually augmented, there is a vast accumulation of unrecorded matter in my head. Now and then I break off a lump, Shakespeare it may be, it may be some old woman called Peck; and say to myself, smoking a cigarette in bed, ""That's Shakespeare. That's Peck""--with a certainty of recognition and a shock of knowledge which is endlessly delightful, though not to be imparted. So we shared our Pecks, our Shakespeares; compared each other's versions; allowed each other's insight to set our own Peck or Shakespeare in a better light; and then sank into one of those silences which are now and again broken by a few words, as if a fin rose in the wastes of silence; and then the fin, the thought, sinks back into the depths, spreading round it a little ripple of satisfaction, content.", it was for this reason that instead of pulling on my patent leather shoes and finding a tolerable tie  i sought neville  i sought my oldest friend  who had known me when i was byron  when i was meredith own young man  and also that hero in a book by dostoevsky whose name i have forgotten  i found him alone  reading  a perfectly neat table  a curtain pulled methodically straight  a paper knife dividing a french volume  nobody  i thought  ever changes the attitude in which we saw them first  or the clothes  here he has sat in this chair  in these clothes  ever since we first met  here was freedom  here was intimacy  the firelight broke off some round apple on the curtain  there we talked  sat talking  sauntered down that avenue  the avenue which runs under the trees  under the thick leaved murmuring trees  the trees that are hung with fruit  which we have trodden so often together  so that now the turf is bare round some of those trees  round certain plays and poems  certain favourites of ours  the turf is trodden bare by our incessant unmethodical pacing  if i have to wait  i read  if i wake in the night  i feel along the shelf for a book  swelling  perpetually augmented  there is a vast accumulation of unrecorded matter in my head  now and then i break off a lump  shakespeare it may be  it may be some old woman called peck  and say to myself  smoking a cigarette in bed   that is shakespeare  that is peck   with a certainty of recognition and a shock of knowledge which is endlessly delightful  though not to be imparted  so we shared our pecks  our shakespeares  compared each other own versions  allowed each other own insight to set our own peck or shakespeare in a better light  and then sank into one of those silences which are now and again broken by a few words  as if a fin rose in the wastes of silence  and then the fin  the thought  sinks back into the depths  spreading round it a little ripple of satisfaction  content ,1949,345,5.349999999999999,1.8756280964210195,1.9180327868852454,1.8756280964210195,0.6767880526738107,7.9499999999999975,2.801375389922749,3.102803738317756,2.801375389922749,0.9116701110540699,0.0,0.44171150191520114,0.41653157217879583,0.44171150191520114,0.34110534632720774,-1.5979166666666642,-0.49812196758187816,-0.5304309195912918,-0.49812196758187816,-0.006455602969873615,7.398000000000002,1.0695123448345483,1.2941897273562755,1.0695123448345483,0.21085212757608,31.496200422990082,1.1861017054907794,1.1737655837306027,1.1861017054907794,0.3810920081512649,3.34731914074391,2.3268882601141434,2.024361720136833,2.3268882601141434,0.7042675078549813,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9799}",0.9799,1.3870556273270884,0.73516392827669,1.3870556273270884,0.30857818053517627,0.1338718820861678,0.524920854840261,0.5180233883498452,0.524920854840261,0.1270088253953459,0.7749480973679351,2.2999292897768306,2.321473737828285,2.2999292897768306,0.6630546601313679,60.586476447464776,2.008198411448285,1.502961123373031,2.008198411448285,-0.5924381711277831,-0.8796,-0.8205295653551249,-0.0749348725545283,-0.8205295653551249,0.0540398883739225

He, who had been thinking with the unlimited time of the mind, which stretches in a flash from Shakespeare to ourselves, poked the fire and began to live by that other clock which marks the approach of a particular person. The wide and dignified sweep of his mind contracted. He became on the alert. I could feel him listening to sounds in the street. I noted how he touched a cushion. From the myriads of mankind and all time past he had chosen one person, one moment in particular. A sound was heard in the hall. What he was saying wavered in the air like an uneasy flame. I watched him disentangle one footstep from other footsteps; wait for some particular mark of identification and glance with the swiftness of a snake at the handle of the door. (Hence the astonishing acuteness of his perceptions; he has been trained always by one person.) So concentrated a passion shot out others like foreign matter from a still, sparkling fluid.

516,516,25,"'This fitful gust blowing so sharp and cold upon me sent me that night across London to visit other friends, Rhoda and Louis, desiring company, certainty, contact. I wondered, as I mounted the stairs, what was their relationship? What did they say alone? I figured her awkward with the tea-kettle. She gazed over the slate roofs--the nymph of the fountain always wet, obsessed with visions, dreaming. She parted the curtain to look at the night. ""Away!"" she said. ""The moor is dark beneath the moon."" I rang; I waited. Louis perhaps poured out milk in a saucer for the cat; Louis, whose bony hands shut like the sides of a dock closing themselves with a slow anguish of effort upon an enormous tumult of waters, who knew what has been said by the Egyptian, the Indian, by men with high cheek-bones and solitaires in hair shirts. I knocked: I waited; there was no answer. I tramped down the stone stairs again. Our friends--how distant, how mute, how seldom visited and little known. And I, too, am dim to my friends and unknown; a phantom, sometimes seen, often not. Life is a dream surely. Our flame, the will-o'-the-wisp that dances in a few eyes, is soon to be blown out and all will fade. I recalled my friends. I thought of Susan. She had bought fields. Cucumbers and tomatoes ripened in her hothouses. The vine that had been killed by last year's frost was putting out a leaf or two. She walked heavily with her sons across her meadows. She went about the land attended by men in gaiters, pointing with her stick at a roof, at hedges, at walls fallen into disrepair. The pigeons followed her, waddling, for the grain that she let fall from her capable, earthy fingers. ""But I no longer rise at dawn,"" she said. Then Jinny--entertaining, no doubt, some new young man. They reached the crisis of the usual conversation. The room would be darkened; chairs arranged. For she still sought the moment. Without illusions, hard and clear as crystal, she rode at the day with her breast bared. She let its spikes pierce her. When the lock whitened on her forehead she twisted it fearlessly among the rest. So when they come to bury her nothing will be out of order. Bits of ribbons will be found curled up. But still the door opens. Who is coming in? she asks, and rises to meet him, prepared, as on those first spring nights when the tree under the big London houses where respectable citizens were going soberly to bed scarcely sheltered her love; and the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor, her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied. Our friends, how seldom visited, how little known--it is true; and yet, when I meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what I call ""my life"", it is not one life that I look back upon; I am not one person; I am many people; I do not altogether know who I am--Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda, or Louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs.", this fitful gust blowing so sharp and cold upon me sent me that night across london to visit other friends  rhoda and louis  desiring company  certainty  contact  i wondered  as i mounted the stairs  what was their relationship  what did they say alone  i figured her awkward with the tea kettle  she gazed over the slate roofs  the nymph of the fountain always wet  obsessed with visions  dreaming  she parted the curtain to look at the night   away   she said   the moor is dark beneath the moon   i rang  i waited  louis perhaps poured out milk in a saucer for the cat  louis  whose bony hands shut like the sides of a dock closing themselves with a slow anguish of effort upon an enormous tumult of waters  who knew what has been said by the egyptian  the indian  by men with high cheek bones and solitaires in hair shirts  i knocked  i waited  there was no answer  i tramped down the stone stairs again  our friends  how distant  how mute  how seldom visited and little known  and i  too  am dim to my friends and unknown  a phantom  sometimes seen  often not  life is a dream surely  our flame  the will of the wisp that dances in a few eyes  is soon to be blown out and all will fade  i recalled my friends  i thought of susan  she had bought fields  cucumbers and tomatoes ripened in her hothouses  the vine that had been killed by last year own frost was putting out a leaf or two  she walked heavily with her sons across her meadows  she went about the land attended by men in gaiters  pointing with her stick at a roof  at hedges  at walls fallen into disrepair  the pigeons followed her  waddling  for the grain that she let fall from her capable  earthy fingers   but i no longer rise at dawn   she said  then jinny  entertaining  no doubt  some new young man  they reached the crisis of the usual conversation  the room would be darkened  chairs arranged  for she still sought the moment  without illusions  hard and clear as crystal  she rode at the day with her breast bared  she let its spikes pierce her  when the lock whitened on her forehead she twisted it fearlessly among the rest  so when they come to bury her nothing will be out of order  bits of ribbons will be found curled up  but still the door opens  who is coming in  she asks  and rises to meet him  prepared  as on those first spring nights when the tree under the big london houses where respectable citizens were going soberly to bed scarcely sheltered her love  and the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor  her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied  our friends  how seldom visited  how little known  it is true  and yet  when i meet an unknown person  and try to break off  here at this table  what i call  my life   it is not one life that i look back upon  i am not one person  i am many people  i do not altogether know who i am  jinny  susan  neville  rhoda  or louis  or how to distinguish my life from theirs ,3010,545,0.5499999999999998,0.3587727341473799,0.34426229508196715,0.3587727341473799,0.22290889160434846,2.05,0.8206354626256325,0.897196261682243,0.8206354626256325,0.2544482564481064,-122.93791632591642,-1.5344864701215652,-1.5463620543759158,-1.5344864701215652,-0.020419486507581363,-4.730853174603172,-1.9344044248492096,-1.8665566626472885,-1.9344044248492096,-0.18207840284690968,9.136,1.4221580097154805,1.6491371387725926,1.4221580097154805,0.10103547354501263,49.01730026286942,1.883567390257246,1.8267225660003308,1.883567390257246,0.37544269318630763,1.0902122112501842,0.7421626227468986,0.6593287865554768,0.7421626227468986,0.1452025242156671,"{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.988}",0.988,1.3990108117395068,0.7412409032935704,1.3990108117395068,0.1969531783663006,0.022525252525252518,-0.15490342274524047,-0.09956568168300083,-0.15490342274524047,-0.16667307486906555,0.15299657380692633,0.12524942692682314,0.2678655975588314,0.12524942692682314,-0.1266087182577646,87.3727215016219,3.6164141709331434,2.634207331846025,3.6164141709331434,-0.8656425515136371,-0.8394,-0.7766696912539149,-0.05440057209991318,-0.7766696912539149,0.12013800652998508

Our discomfort was at first considerable, for each by that time was committed to a statement, and the other person coming along the road to the meeting-place dressed like this or that, with a stick or without, seemed to contradict it. I saw Jinny look at Susan's earthy fingers and then hide her own; I, considering Neville, so neat and exact, felt the nebulosity of my own life blurred with all these phrases. He then boasted, because he was ashamed of one room and one person and his own success. Louis and Rhoda, the conspirators, the spies at table, who take notes, felt, ""After all, Bernard can make the waiter fetch us rolls--a contact denied us."" We saw for a moment laid out among us the body of the complete human being whom we have failed to be, but at the same time, cannot forget. All that we might have been we saw; all that we had missed, and we grudged for a moment the other's claim, as children when the cake is cut, the one cake, the only cake, watch their slice diminishing.", owno i thought that night in early autumn when we came together and dined once more at hampton court  our discomfort was at first considerable  for each by that time was committed to a statement  and the other person coming along the road to the meeting place dressed like this or that  with a stick or without  seemed to contradict it  i saw jinny look at susan own earthy fingers and then hide her own  i  considering neville  so neat and exact  felt the nebulosity of my own life blurred with all these phrases  he then boasted  because he was ashamed of one room and one person and his own success  louis and rhoda  the conspirators  the spies at table  who take notes  felt   after all  bernard can make the waiter fetch us rolls  a contact denied us   we saw for a moment laid out among us the body of the complete human being whom we have failed to be  but at the same time  cannot forget  all that we might have been we saw  all that we had missed  and we grudged for a moment the other own claim  as children when the cake is cut  the one cake  the only cake  watch their slice diminishing ,1094,203,-1.95,-0.4312561003701406,-0.4754098360655737,-0.4312561003701406,-0.109408822385351,-1.95,-0.5222390643554636,-0.5981308411214954,-0.5222390643554636,-0.20117507292176087,-63.16402370896153,-0.5736352624501051,-0.5919795793944986,-0.5736352624501051,-0.15757532818204234,3.7312499999999997,1.9450135941498028,1.7423367392270108,1.9450135941498028,0.9917271337316114,11.327000000000002,1.8667187989871283,2.0965996119677324,1.8667187989871283,1.0169547763182418,-6.522000523737725,-0.3272959007796523,-0.24305470656862024,-0.3272959007796523,-0.13411444676654036,-1.4725591926306114,-1.0571715130764756,-0.8905611729434658,-1.0571715130764756,-0.5265460384601978,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.5084}",-0.5084,-0.8095988123028174,-0.381423962787906,-0.8095988123028174,-0.27208967090493724,0.2138888888888889,1.0134628435715352,0.9618413019497277,1.0134628435715352,0.6908224194408579,0.7206068949114488,2.1099229721967045,2.1420457092936394,2.1099229721967045,1.186776505844319,39.206888503790026,0.7245922101015188,0.600050776995703,0.7245922101015188,-0.2794329789725888,-0.9997,-0.9515636668366002,-0.13628237217142566,-0.9515636668366002,-0.10148833608343749

And, half-way through dinner, we felt enlarge itself round us the huge blackness of what is outside us, of what we are not. The wind, the rush of wheels became the roar of time, and we rushed--where? And who were we? We were extinguished for a moment, went out like sparks in burnt paper and the blackness roared. Past time, past history we went. For me this lasts but one second. It is ended by my own pugnacity. I strike the table with a spoon. If I could measure things with compasses I would, but since my only measure is a phrase, I make phrases--I forget what, on this occasion. We became six people at a table in Hampton Court. We rose and walked together down the avenue. In the thin, the unreal twilight, fitfully like the echo of voices laughing down some alley, geniality returned to me and flesh. Against the gateway, against some cedar tree I saw blaze bright, Neville, Jinny, Rhoda, Louis, Susan, and myself, our life, our identity. Still King William seemed an unreal monarch and his crown mere tinsel. But we--against the brick, against the branches, we six, out of how many million millions, for one moment out of what measureless abundance of past time and time to come, burnt there triumphant. The moment was all; the moment was enough. And then Neville, Jinny, Susan and I, as a wave breaks, burst asunder, surrendered--to the next leaf, to the precise bird, to a child with a hoop, to a prancing dog, to the warmth that is hoarded in woods after a hot day, to the lights twisted like white ribbon on rippled waters.

We had lost what they had kept. We interrupted. But we were tired, and whether it had been good or bad, accomplished or left undone, the dusky veil was falling upon our endeavours; the lights were sinking as we paused for a moment upon the terrace that overlooks the river. The steamers were landing their trippers on the bank; there was a distant cheering, the sound of singing, as if people waved their hats and joined in some last song. The sound of the chorus came across the water and I felt leap up that old impulse, which has moved me all my life, to be thrown up and down on the roar of other people's voices, singing the same song; to be tossed up and down on the roar of almost senseless merriment, sentiment, triumph, desire. But not now. No! I could not collect myself; I could not distinguish myself; I could not help letting fall the things that had made me a minute ago eager, amused, jealous, vigilant, and hosts of other things, into the water.

I thought how Louis would mount those steps in his neat suit with his cane in his hand and his angular, rather detached gait. With his Australian accent (""My father, a banker at Brisbane"") he would come, I thought, with greater respect to these old ceremonies than I do, who have heard the same lullabies for a thousand years. I am always impressed, as I enter, by the rubbed roses; the polished brasses; the flapping and the chanting, while one boy's voice wails round the dome like some lost and wandering dove. The recumbency and the peace of the dead impress me--warriors at rest under their old banners. Then I scoff at the floridity and absurdity of some scrolloping tomb; and the trumpets and the victories and the coats of arms and the certainty, so sonorously repeated, of resurrection, of eternal life. My wandering and inquisitive eye then shows me an awe-stricken child; a shuffling pensioner; or the obeisances of tired shop-girls burdened with heaven knows what strife in their poor thin breasts come to solace themselves in the rush hour. I stray and look and wonder, and sometimes, rather furtively, try to rise on the shaft of somebody else's prayer into the dome, out, beyond, wherever they go. But then like the lost and wailing dove, I find myself failing, fluttering, descending and perching upon some curious gargoyle, some battered nose or absurd tombstone, with humour, with wonder, and so again watch the sightseers with their Baedekers shuffling past, while the boy's voice soars in the dome and the organ now and then indulges in a moment of elephantine triumph.
