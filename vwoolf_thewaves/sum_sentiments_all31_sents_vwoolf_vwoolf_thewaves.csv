0,0,The sun had not yet risen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,"The sea was indistinguishable from the sky, except that the sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had wrinkles in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2,"Gradually as the sky whitened a dark line lay on the horizon dividing the sea from the sky and the grey cloth became barred with thick strokes moving, one after another, beneath the surface, following each other, pursuing each other, perpetually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,3,"As they neared the shore each bar rose, heaped itself, broke and swept a thin veil of white water across the sand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4,"The wave paused, and then drew out again, sighing like a sleeper whose breath comes and goes unconsciously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,5,Gradually the dark bar on the horizon became clear as if the sediment in an old wine-bottle had sunk and left the glass green.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,6,"Behind it, too, the sky cleared as if the white sediment there had sunk, or as if the arm of a woman couched beneath the horizon had raised a lamp and flat bars of white, green and yellow spread across the sky like the blades of a fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,Then she raised her lamp higher and the air seemed to become fibrous and to tear away from the green surface flickering and flaming in red and yellow fibres like the smoky fire that roars from a bonfire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,8,"Gradually the fibres of the burning bonfire were fused into one haze, one incandescence which lifted the weight of the woollen grey sky on top of it and turned it to a million atoms of soft blue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,9,The surface of the sea slowly became transparent and lay rippling and sparkling until the dark stripes were almost rubbed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10,"Slowly the arm that held the lamp raised it higher and then higher until a broad flame became visible; an arc of fire burnt on the rim of the horizon, and all round it the sea blazed gold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,11,"The light struck upon the trees in the garden, making one leaf transparent and then another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,12,One bird chirped high up; there was a pause; another chirped lower down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,"The sun sharpened the walls of the house, and rested like the tip of a fan upon a white blind and made a blue finger-print of shadow under the leaf by the bedroom window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,14,"The blind stirred slightly, but all within was dim and unsubstantial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,15,The birds sang their blank melody outside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,16,"'I see a ring,' said Bernard, 'hanging above me. It quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,17,"'I see a slab of pale yellow,' said Susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,18,"'I hear a sound,' said Rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,19,"'I see a globe,' said Neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,20,"'I see a crimson tassel,' said Jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,21,"'I hear something stamping,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,22,"'A great beast's foot is chained. It stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,23,"'Look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said Bernard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,24,"'It has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,25,"'The leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,26,"'A shadow falls on the path,' said Louis, 'like an elbow bent.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,27,"'Islands of light are swimming on the grass,' said Rhoda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,28,'They have fallen through the trees.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,29,"'The birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said Neville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,30,"'The stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said Jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,31,"'A caterpillar is curled in a green ring,' said Susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,32,"'The grey-shelled snail draws across the path and flattens the blades behind him,' said Rhoda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,33,"'And burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,34,"'Stones are cold to my feet,' said Neville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,35,"'I feel each one, round or pointed, separately.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,36,"'The back of my hand burns,' said Jinny, 'but the palm is clammy and damp with dew.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,37,"'Now the cock crows like a spurt of hard, red water in the white tide,' said Bernard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,38,"'Birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,"'The beast stamps; the elephant with its foot chained; the great brute on the beach stamps,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,40,"'Look at the house,' said Jinny, 'with all its windows white with blinds.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,41,"'Cold water begins to run from the scullery tap,' said Rhoda, 'over the mackerel in the bowl.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,42,"'The walls are cracked with gold cracks,' said Bernard, 'and there are blue, finger-shaped shadows of leaves beneath the windows.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,43,"'Now Mrs Constable pulls up her thick black stockings,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,44,"'When the smoke rises, sleep curls off the roof like a mist,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,45,"'The birds sang in chorus first,' said Rhoda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,46,'Now the scullery door is unbarred. Off they fly. Off they fly like a fling of seed. But one sings by the bedroom window alone.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,47,"'Bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said Jinny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,48,"'Then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,49,"'Now Billy scrapes the fish-scales with a jagged knife on to a wooden board,' said Neville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,50,"'The dining-room window is dark blue now,' said Bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,51,"'A swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,52,'And Biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,53,"'That is the first stroke of the church bell,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,54,"'Then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one, two.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,55,"'Look at the table-cloth, flying white along the table,' said Rhoda.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,56,"'Now there are rounds of white china, and silver streaks beside each plate.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,57,"'Suddenly a bee booms in my ear,' said Neville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,58,'It is here; it is past.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,59,"'I burn, I shiver,' said Jinny, 'out of this sun, into this shadow.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,60,"'Now they have all gone,' said Louis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,61,'I am alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,62,"They have gone into the house for breakfast, and I am left standing by the wall among the flowers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,63,"It is very early, before lessons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,64,Flower after flower is specked on the depths of green.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,65,The petals are harlequins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,66,Stalks rise from the black hollows beneath.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,67,"The flowers swim like fish made of light upon the dark, green waters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,68,I hold a stalk in my hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,69,I am the stalk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,70,"My roots go down to the depths of the world, through earth dry with brick, and damp earth, through veins of lead and silver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,71,I am all fibre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,"All tremors shake me, and the weight of the earth is pressed to my ribs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,73,"Up here my eyes are green leaves, unseeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,74,I am a boy in grey flannels with a belt fastened by a brass snake up here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,75,Down there my eyes are the lidless eyes of a stone figure in a desert by the Nile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,76,I see women passing with red pitchers to the river; I see camels swaying and men in turbans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,77,"I hear tramplings, tremblings, stirrings round me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,"'Up here Bernard, Neville, Jinny and Susan (but not Rhoda) skim the flower-beds with their nets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,They skim the butterflies from the nodding tops of the flowers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,80,They brush the surface of the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,81,Their nets are full of fluttering wings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,82,"""Louis! Louis! Louis!"" they shout.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,But they cannot see me. I am on the other side of the hedge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,There are only little eye-holes among the leaves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,85,"Oh Lord, let them pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,86,"Lord, let them lay their butterflies on a pocket-handkerchief on the gravel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,87,"Let them count out their tortoise-shells, their red admirals and cabbage whites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,88,But let me be unseen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,89,I am green as a yew tree in the shade of the hedge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,90,My hair is made of leaves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,91,I am rooted to the middle of the earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,92,My body is a stalk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,93,I press the stalk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,94,"A drop oozes from the hole at the mouth and slowly, thickly, grows larger and larger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,95,Now something pink passes the eyehole.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,96,Now an eye-beam is slid through the chink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,97,Its beam strikes me. I am a boy in a grey flannel suit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,98,She has found me. I am struck on the nape of the neck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,99,She has kissed me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,100,All is shattered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,101,"'I was running,' said Jinny, 'after breakfast. I saw leaves moving in a hole in the hedge. I thought ""That is a bird on its nest.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,102,"I parted them and looked; but there was no bird on a nest. The leaves went on moving. I was frightened. I ran past Susan, past Rhoda, and Neville and Bernard in the tool-house talking. I cried as I ran, faster and faster. What moved the leaves? What moves my heart, my legs? And I dashed in here, seeing you green as a bush, like a branch, very still, Louis, with your eyes fixed. ""Is he dead?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,103,"I thought, and kissed you, with my heart jumping under my pink frock like the leaves, which go on moving, though there is nothing to move them. Now I smell geraniums; I smell earth mould. I dance. I ripple. I am thrown over you like a net of light. I lie quivering flung over you.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,"'Through the chink in the hedge,' said Susan, 'I saw her kiss him. I raised my head from my flower-pot and looked through a chink in the hedge. I saw her kiss him. I saw them, Jinny and Louis, kissing. Now I will wrap my agony inside my pocket-handkerchief. It shall be screwed tight into a ball. I will go to the beech wood alone, before lessons. I will not sit at a table, doing sums. I will not sit next Jinny and next Louis. I will take my anguish and lay it upon the roots under the beech trees. I will examine it and take it between my fingers. They will not find me. I shall eat nuts and peer for eggs through the brambles and my hair will be matted and I shall sleep under hedges and drink water from ditches and die there.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,105,"'Susan has passed us,' said Bernard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,106,"'She has passed the tool-house door with her handkerchief screwed into a ball. She was not crying, but her eyes, which are so beautiful, were narrow as cats' eyes before they spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,107,"I shall follow her, Neville.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,108,"I shall go gently behind her, to be at hand, with my curiosity, to comfort her when she bursts out in a rage and thinks, ""I am alone.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,109,"'Now she walks across the field with a swing, nonchalantly, to deceive us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,110,Then she comes to the dip; she thinks she is unseen; she begins to run with her fists clenched in front of her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,111,Her nails meet in the ball of her pocket-handkerchief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,She is making for the beech woods out of the light.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,113,She spreads her arms as she comes to them and takes to the shade like a swimmer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,114,"But she is blind after the light and trips and flings herself down on the roots under the trees, where the light seems to pant in and out, in and out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,115,The branches heave up and down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,There is agitation and trouble here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,117,There is gloom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,118,The light is fitful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,119,There is anguish here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"The roots make a skeleton on the ground, with dead leaves heaped in the angles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,121,Susan has spread her anguish out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,122,"Her pocket-handkerchief is laid on the roots of the beech trees and she sobs, sitting crumpled where she has fallen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,123,"'I saw her kiss him,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,124,"'I looked between the leaves and saw her. She danced in flecked with diamonds light as dust. And I am squat, Bernard, I am short. I have eyes that look close to the ground and see insects in the grass. The yellow warmth in my side turned to stone when I saw Jinny kiss Louis. I shall eat grass and die in a ditch in the brown water where dead leaves have rotted.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,"'I saw you go,' said Bernard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"'As you passed the door of the tool-house I heard you cry ""I am unhappy.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,127,"I put down my knife. I was making boats out of firewood with Neville. And my hair is untidy, because when Mrs Constable told me to brush it there was a fly in a web, and I asked, ""Shall I free the fly? Shall I let the fly be eaten?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,128,"So I am late always. My hair is unbrushed and these chips of wood stick in it. When I heard you cry I followed you, and saw you put down your handkerchief, screwed up, with its rage, with its hate, knotted in it. But soon that will cease. Our bodies are close now. You hear me breathe. You see the beetle too carrying off a leaf on its back. It runs this way, then that way, so that even your desire while you watch the beetle, to possess one single thing (it is Louis now) must waver, like the light in and out of the beech leaves; and then words, moving darkly, in the depths of your mind will break up this knot of hardness, screwed in your pocket-handkerchief.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,129,"'I love,' said Susan, 'and I hate. I desire one thing only. My eyes are hard. Jinny's eyes break into a thousand lights. Rhoda's are like those pale flowers to which moths come in the evening. Yours grow full and brim and never break. But I am already set on my pursuit. I see insects in the grass. Though my mother still knits white socks for me and hems pinafores and I am a child, I love and I hate.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,130,"'But when we sit together, close,' said Bernard, 'we melt into each other with phrases. We are edged with mist. We make an unsubstantial territory.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,"'I see the beetle,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,132,"'It is black, I see; it is green, I see; I am tied down with single words. But you wander off; you slip away; you rise up higher, with words and words in phrases.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,133,"'Now,' said Bernard, 'let us explore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,134,There is the white house lying among the trees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,135,It lies down there ever so far beneath us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,We shall sink like swimmers just touching the ground with the tips of their toes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,137,"We shall sink through the green air of the leaves, Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,138,We sink as we run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,139,"The waves close over us, the beech leaves meet above our heads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,There is the stable clock with its gilt hands shining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,141,Those are the flats and heights of the roofs of the great house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,142,There is the stable-boy clattering in the yard in rubber boots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,143,That is Elvedon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,144,'Now we have fallen through the tree-tops to the earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,145,"The air no longer rolls its long, unhappy, purple waves over us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,146,We touch earth; we tread ground.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,147,That is the close-clipped hedge of the ladies' garden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,148,"There they walk at noon, with scissors, clipping roses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,149,Now we are in the ringed wood with the wall round it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,150,This is Elvedon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,151,"I have seen signposts at the cross-roads with one arm pointing ""To Elvedon"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,152,No one has been there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,153,"The ferns smell very strong, and there are red funguses growing beneath them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,154,"Now we wake the sleeping daws who have never seen a human form; now we tread on rotten oak apples, red with age and slippery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,155,There is a ring of wall round this wood; nobody comes here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,156,Listen!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,157,That is the flop of a giant toad in the undergrowth; that is the patter of some primeval fir-cone falling to rot among the ferns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,158,'Put your foot on this brick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
159,159,Look over the wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
160,160,That is Elvedon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,161,"The lady sits between the two long windows, writing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,162,The gardeners sweep the lawn with giant brooms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,163,We are the first to come here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
164,164,We are the discoverers of an unknown land.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165,165,Do not stir; if the gardeners saw us they would shoot us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,166,We should be nailed like stoats to the stable door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,167,Look!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,168,Do not move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,169,Grasp the ferns tight on the top of the wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
170,170,'I see the lady writing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
171,171,"I see the gardeners sweeping,' said Susan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
172,172,"'If we died here, nobody would bury us.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
173,173,'Run!' said Bernard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
174,174,'Run!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,175,The gardener with the black beard has seen us!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
176,176,We shall be shot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
177,177,We shall be shot like jays and pinned to the wall!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
178,178,We are in a hostile country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,179,We must escape to the beech wood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
180,180,We must hide under the trees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
181,181,I turned a twig as we came.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,182,There is a secret path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
183,183,Bend as low as you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
184,184,Follow without looking back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
185,185,They will think we are foxes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
186,186,Run!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
187,187,'Now we are safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
188,188,Now we can stand upright again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
189,189,"Now we can stretch our arms in this high canopy, in this vast wood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
190,190,I hear nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
191,191,That is only the murmur of the waves in the air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
192,192,That is a wood-pigeon breaking cover in the tops of the beech trees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
193,193,The pigeon beats the air; the pigeon beats the air with wooden wings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
194,194,"'Now you trail away,' said Susan, 'making phrases. Now you mount like an air-ball's string, higher and higher through the layers of the leaves, out of reach. Now you lag.

I will drop a twig in as a raft for a drowning sailor. I will drop a stone in and see bubbles rise from the depths of the sea. Neville has gone and Susan has gone; Jinny is in the kitchen garden picking currants with Louis perhaps. I have a short time alone, while Miss Hudson spreads our copy-books on the schoolroom table. I have a short space of freedom. I have picked all the fallen petals and made them swim. I have put raindrops in some. I will plant a lighthouse here, a head of Sweet Alice. And I will now rock the brown basin from side to side so that my ships may ride the waves. Some will founder. Some will dash themselves against the cliffs. One sails alone. That is my ship. It sails into icy caverns where the sea-bear barks and stalactites swing green chains. The waves rise; their crests curl; look at the lights on the mastheads. They have scattered, they have foundered, all except my ship, which mounts the wave and sweeps before the gale and reaches the islands where the parrots chatter and the creepers . . .'",-0.10881932888433464,-0.07525430712685816,-0.07456854876301162,-0.25633602407363565,-0.0686436145223455,-0.022983676242355342,-0.046684793465128015,-0.03142916337080505,-0.13432797456844675,-0.03183314497167858,-0.02433982856565202,0.1406712207288855,-0.38777093571948834,-0.2898581305149817,-0.42137636661178435,-1.0101569223974556,-2.240550811148817,-0.29058007609099284,0.8771282508979455,-1.1783116775283888,-1.5063972703552808,-1.1721556935714856,-0.7379299826160843,-1.3849663360385696,-1.7619665621458585,-0.8365663087922232,1.362447197994043,0.15095349814231557,-0.10561264179341462,1.0406890109415587,0.9067964917380829

Now they twist their copy-books, and, looking sideways at Miss Hudson, count the purple buttons on her bodice. Bernard has a chip in his hair. Susan has a red look in her eyes. Both are flushed. But I am pale; I am neat, and my knickerbockers are drawn together by a belt with a brass snake. I know the lesson by heart. I know more than they will ever know. I knew my cases and my genders; I could know everything in the world if I wished. But I do not wish to come to the top and say my lesson. My roots are threaded, like fibres in a flower-pot, round and round about the world. I do not wish to come to the top and live in the light of this great clock, yellow-faced, which ticks and ticks. Jinny and Susan, Bernard and Neville bind themselves into a thong with which to lash me. They laugh at my neatness, at my Australian accent.

206,206,"'Now Miss Hudson,' said Rhoda, 'has shut the book. Now the terror is beginning. Now taking her lump of chalk she draws figures, six, seven, eight, and then a cross and then a line on the blackboard. What is the answer? The others look; they look with understanding. Louis writes; Susan writes; Neville writes; Jinny writes; even Bernard has now begun to write. But I cannot write. I see only figures. The others are handing in their answers, one by one. Now it is my turn. But I have no answer. The others are allowed to go. They slam the door. Miss Hudson goes. I am left alone to find an answer. The figures mean nothing now. Meaning has gone. The clock ticks. The two hands are convoys marching through a desert. The black bars on the clock face are green oases. The long hand has marched ahead to find water. The other, painfully stumbles among hot stones in the desert. It will die in the desert. The kitchen door slams. Wild dogs bark far away. Look, the loop of the figure is beginning to fill with time; it holds the world in it. I begin to draw a figure and the world is looped in it, and I myself am outside the loop; which I now join--so--and seal up, and make entire.

Her shoulder-blades meet across her back like the wings of a small butterfly. And as she stares at the chalk figures, her mind lodges in those white circles, it steps through those white loops into emptiness, alone. They have no meaning for her. She has no answer for them. She has no body as the others have. And I, who speak with an Australian accent, whose father is a banker in Brisbane, do not fear her as I fear the others.'",-0.09794681573942353,-0.06392272209362126,-0.060491064870998354,-0.22461206368742195,-0.055942459420382465,-0.05614213253488577,-0.051879086652376526,-0.03457930351260971,-0.12809316243369226,-0.0038607775523269716,-0.02194067515548224,0.12337214343159206,-0.19068081064003198,-0.0819194781302482,-0.17499159153231575,-0.7975778173825192,-2.0025546368580267,-0.8419946121181784,0.9701676683291112,-1.0018417656468233,-1.303419455288782,-1.2491090892870216,-1.282829975458947,-1.3825209400973542,-1.2667923811016553,-0.7094463503063062,1.4934255238341114,0.29746633626416263,-0.021137301183448958,1.0976893914977002,0.9258690701896584

Let us take possession of our secret territory, which is lit by pendant currants like candelabra, shining red on one side, black on the other. Here, Jinny, if we curl up close, we can sit under the canopy of the currant leaves and watch the censers swing. This is our universe. The others pass down the carriage-drive.

240,240,"'I saw Florrie in the kitchen garden,' said Susan, 'as we came back from our walk, with the washing blown out round her, the pyjamas, the drawers, the night-gowns blown tight. And Ernest kissed her. He was in his green baize apron, cleaning silver; and his mouth was sucked like a purse in wrinkles and he seized her with the pyjamas blown out hard between them. He was blind as a bull, and she swooned in anguish, only little veins streaking her white cheeks red. Now though they pass plates of bread and butter and cups of milk at tea-time I see a crack in the earth and hot steam hisses up; and the urn roars as Ernest roared, and I am blown out hard like the pyjamas, even while my teeth meet in the soft bread and butter, and I lap the sweet milk. I am not afraid of heat, nor of the frozen winter. Rhoda dreams, sucking a crust soaked in milk; Louis regards the wall opposite with snail-green eyes; Bernard moulds his bread into pellets and calls them ""people"". Neville with his clean and decisive ways has finished. He has rolled his napkin and slipped it through the silver ring. Jinny spins her fingers on the table-cloth, as if they were dancing in the sunshine, pirouetting. But I am not afraid of the heat or of the frozen winter.'",-0.0851779340227256,-0.04468538006045159,-0.017980521238476994,-0.18531806123475483,-0.03911811815530854,-0.057013786491154315,-0.054603248727402014,-0.02193346229319794,-0.13929558238307435,0.05603143109016616,-0.023444526977906086,0.13860110954583954,0.12371364243335836,0.14725862161530645,0.5166897368544267,-0.5971242788044454,-1.5715564764098422,-0.9470122075108443,0.7051641956282388,-0.7465235952649837,-0.7814765022606407,-1.3414531641456646,-1.1660656912783336,-1.121965108710411,-0.22752446649870578,-0.666020451562052,1.379733860920947,0.17899511155590114,0.1754204162024171,0.8411876789950631,0.5485052542678798

257,257,"'As I fold up my frock and my chemise,' said Rhoda, 'so I put off my hopeless desire to be Susan, to be Jinny. But I will stretch my toes so that they touch the rail at the end of the bed; I will assure myself, touching the rail, of something hard. Now I cannot sink; cannot altogether fall through the thin sheet now. Now I spread my body on this frail mattress and hang suspended. I am above the earth now. I am no longer upright, to be knocked against and damaged. All is soft, and bending. Walls and cupboards whiten and bend their yellow squares on top of which a pale glass gleams. Out of me now my mind can pour. I can think of my Armadas sailing on the high waves. I am relieved of hard contacts and collisions. I sail on alone under the white cliffs. Oh, but I sink, I fall! That is the corner of the cupboard; that is the nursery looking-glass. But they stretch, they elongate. I sink down on the black plumes of sleep; its thick wings are pressed to my eyes. Travelling through darkness I see the stretched flower-beds, and Mrs Constable runs from behind the corner of the pampas-grass to say my aunt has come to fetch me in a carriage. I mount; I escape; I rise on spring-heeled boots over the tree-tops. But I am now fallen into the carriage at the hall door, where she sits nodding yellow plumes with eyes hard like glazed marbles. Oh, to awake from dreaming! Look, there is the chest of drawers. Let me pull myself out of these waters.

And when he leaves the room, lurching rather heavily from side to side, and hurls his way through the swing-doors, all the masters, lurching rather heavily from side to side, hurl themselves also through the swing-doors.

309,309,"'Now we march, two by two,' said Louis, 'orderly, processional, into chapel. I like the dimness that falls as we enter the sacred building. I like the orderly progress. We file in; we seat ourselves. We put off our distinctions as we enter. I like it now, when, lurching slightly, but only from his momentum, Dr Crane mounts the pulpit and reads the lesson from a Bible spread on the back of the brass eagle. I rejoice; my heart expands in his bulk, in his authority. He lays the whirling dust clouds in my tremulous, my ignominiously agitated mind--how we danced round the Christmas tree and handing parcels they forgot me, and the fat woman said, ""This little boy has no present,"" and gave me a shiny Union Jack from the top of the tree, and I cried with fury--to be remembered with pity. Now all is laid by his authority, his crucifix, and I feel come over me the sense of the earth under me, and my roots going down and down till they wrap themselves round some hardness at the centre. I recover my continuity, as he reads. I become a figure in the procession, a spoke in the huge wheel that turning, at last erects me, here and now. I have been in the dark; I have been hidden; but when the wheel turns (as he reads) I rise into this dim light where I just perceive, but scarcely, kneeling boys, pillars and memorial brasses. There is no crudity here, no sudden kisses.'",-0.03991793744274678,-0.01200825112739628,-0.0027681482233377418,-0.20858102620221403,0.003924127002332773,-0.04494958168799606,-0.019077126857334856,-0.018658626201507596,-0.10517625250483402,0.04121148499613169,-0.016443875866643858,0.1746609533727744,1.0905472367127333,0.9652607966810625,0.8502304401751992,-0.7590967390846249,-1.6983349215938766,-0.30273453304053277,-0.23088747220846553,-0.21335918064408504,-0.5205050257465701,-0.7873887149938062,-0.7768514106762887,-1.2244820724754313,-0.17360685788764524,-0.44122067337185744,1.1868614338239538,0.261019700079531,-0.4746768244176393,0.15718311232136378,-0.019392960956325936

325,325,"'At last,' said Bernard, 'the growl ceases. The sermon ends. He has minced the dance of the white butterflies at the door to powder. His rough and hairy voice is like an unshaven chin. Now he lurches back to his seat like a drunken sailor. It is an action that all the other masters will try to imitate; but, being flimsy, being floppy, wearing grey trousers, they will only succeed in making themselves ridiculous. I do not despise them. Their antics seem pitiable in my eyes. I note the fact for future reference with many others in my notebook. When I am grown up I shall carry a notebook--a fat book with many pages, methodically lettered. I shall enter my phrases. Under B shall come ""Butterfly powder"". If, in my novel, I describe the sun on the window-sill, I shall look under B and find butterfly powder. That will be useful. The tree ""shades the window with green fingers"". That will be useful.

331,331,"'And now,' said Neville, 'let Bernard begin. Let him burble on, telling us stories, while we lie recumbent. Let him describe what we have all seen so that it becomes a sequence. Bernard says there is always a story. I am a story. Louis is a story. There is the story of the boot-boy, the story of the man with one eye, the story of the woman who sells winkles. Let him burble on with his story while I lie back and regard the stiff-legged figures of the padded batsmen through the trembling grasses. It seems as if the whole world were flowing and curving--on the earth the trees, in the sky the clouds. I look up, through the trees, into the sky. The match seems to be played up there. Faintly among the soft, white clouds I hear the cry ""Run"", I hear the cry ""How's that?""",0.010146192852425328,0.04016974507215976,0.037739786979944866,-0.17246430534664925,0.018732092905755386,0.003791162731024869,0.013719707245740032,0.04303521747349511,-0.08183554863201355,0.06549710271059464,-0.01609955571643809,0.1526929975010281,1.9629667755001117,1.869916712298673,1.3546674375589622,-0.4271734343467278,-1.499405970332295,0.7772643349766031,0.28059918099233727,0.49252046688217554,0.030434758005356156,-0.40262173641612686,0.11834143470841435,-0.934944909454239,-0.13710169700810057,-0.3374014330414529,1.4171932676200865,0.15752315551427745,-0.47161055736732593,-0.013818029347061235,-0.08565287796147977

One floats, too, as if one were that bubble; one is freed; I have escaped, one feels. Even the chubby little boys (Dalton, Larpent and Baker) feel the same abandonment. They like this better than the cricket. They catch the phrases as they bubble. They let the feathery grasses tickle their noses. And then we all feel Percival lying heavy among us. His curious guffaw seems to sanction our laughter. But now he has rolled himself over in the long grass. He is, I think, chewing a stalk between his teeth. He feels bored; I too feel bored. Bernard at once perceives that we are bored.

I flicker between the set face of Susan and Rhoda's vagueness; I leap like one of those flames that run between the cracks of the earth; I move, I dance; I never cease to move and to dance. I move like the leaf that moved in the hedge as a child and frightened me.

426,426,"'When Miss Lambert passes,' said Rhoda, 'talking to the clergyman, the others laugh and imitate her hunch behind her back; yet everything changes and becomes luminous. Jinny leaps higher too when Miss Lambert passes. Suppose she saw that daisy, it would change. Wherever she goes, things are changed under her eyes; and yet when she has gone is not the thing the same again? Miss Lambert is taking the clergyman through the wicket-gate to her private garden; and when she comes to the pond, she sees a frog on a leaf, and that will change. All is solemn, all is pale where she stands, like a statue in a grove. She lets her tasselled silken cloak slip down, and only her purple ring still glows, her vinous, her amethystine ring. There is this mystery about people when they leave us. When they leave us I can companion them to the pond and make them stately. When Miss Lambert passes, she makes the daisy change; and everything runs like streaks of fire when she carves the beef. Month by month things are losing their hardness; even my body now lets the light through; my spine is soft like wax near the flame of the candle. I dream; I dream.'",0.016720270567952968,0.052555431038721054,0.0144983843334735,-0.09271799179465001,0.05862249551304145,0.023944693654680372,0.041742428952039494,0.06471350386730741,-0.08524024881032767,0.0649531878617166,-0.008039617654619233,0.1119262075877344,1.3394676595328998,1.5219340880688748,0.874612574258523,-0.5189608564545228,-0.3379168527457332,1.0835370296437674,-0.8471133946125186,0.5751234043586527,-0.2595335492325002,0.16683339187883875,0.39079143112984566,-0.24828136263405334,1.373135941094622,0.7446984649978474,0.9964226218625803,1.4891365072071343,0.07641955678194827,0.24268368315557612,0.31853571276425846

444,444,"'The boasting boys,' said Louis, 'have gone now in a vast team to play cricket. They have driven off in their great brake, singing in chorus. All their heads turn simultaneously at the corner by the laurel bushes. Now they are boasting. Larpent's brother played football for Oxford; Smith's father made a century at Lords. Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith; then again Archie and Hugh; Parker and Dalton; Larpent and Smith--the names repeat themselves; the names are the same always. They are the volunteers; they are the cricketers; they are the officers of the Natural History Society. They are always forming into fours and marching in troops with badges on their caps; they salute simultaneously passing the figure of their general. How majestic is their order, how beautiful is their obedience! If I could follow, if I could be with them, I would sacrifice all I know. But they also leave butterflies trembling with their wings pinched off; they throw dirty pocket-handkerchiefs clotted with blood screwed up into corners. They make little boys sob in dark passages. They have big red ears that stand out under their caps. Yet that is what we wish to be, Neville and I. I watch them go with envy. Peeping from behind a curtain, I note the simultaneity of their movements with delight. If my legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run! If I had been with them and won matches and rowed in great races, and galloped all day, how I should thunder out songs at midnight! In what a torrent the words would rush from my throat!'",0.006606304851756586,0.044122623572126145,0.028751208087508567,-0.08236499138378454,0.09289752720038,0.009394677030678566,0.052455621526074345,0.07395772316888809,-0.06482480925426358,0.07413927449098288,0.0011355686232649381,0.11600346668563644,1.2483204985615899,1.4209093503876278,0.9015865208148248,-0.2379989481709736,-0.2921982403478315,0.9272411914831441,-0.7212956273170327,0.4061628504294947,-0.17254305706114315,0.10527067530641003,0.11834143470841435,-0.1061504643105092,1.6894377680443413,0.9333297440384218,0.9196793311635092,1.5957343705823106,0.0938905973399034,0.5276855859362842,0.5479365107682002

As I stand here with my hand on the grained oak panel of Mr Wickham's door I think myself the friend of Richelieu, or the Duke of St Simon holding out a snuff-box to the King himself. It is my privilege. My witticisms ""run like wildfire through the court"". Duchesses tear emeralds from their earrings out of admiration--but these rockets rise best in darkness, in my cubicle at night. I am now a boy only with a colonial accent holding my knuckles against Mr Wickham's grained oak door. The day has been full of ignominies and triumphs concealed from fear of laughter. I am the best scholar in the school. But when darkness comes I put off this unenviable body--my large nose, my thin lips, my colonial accent--and inhabit space. I am then Virgil's companion, and Plato's. I am then the last scion of one of the great houses of France. But I am also one who will force himself to desert these windy and moonlit territories, these midnight wanderings, and confront grained oak doors. I will achieve in my life--Heaven grant that it be not long--some gigantic amalgamation between the two discrepancies so hideously apparent to me. Out of my suffering I will do it. I will knock.

616,616,"'Now we have received,' said Louis, 'for this is the last day of the last term--Neville's and Bernard's and my last day--whatever our masters have had to give us. The introduction has been made; the world presented. They stay, we depart. The great Doctor, whom of all men I most revere, swaying a little from side to side among the tables, the bound volumes, has dealt out Horace, Tennyson, the complete works of Keats and Matthew Arnold, suitably inscribed. I respect the hand which gave them. He speaks with complete conviction. To him his words are true, though not to us. Speaking in the gruff voice of deep emotion, fiercely, tenderly, he has told us that we are about to go. He has bid us ""quit ourselves like men"". (On his lips quotations from the Bible, from The Times, seem equally magnificent.) Some will do this; others that. Some will not meet again. Neville, Bernard and I shall not meet here again. Life will divide us. But we have formed certain ties. Our boyish, our irresponsible years are over. But we have forged certain links. Above all, we have inherited traditions. These stone flags have been worn for six hundred years. On these walls are inscribed the names of men of war, of statesmen, of some unhappy poets (mine shall be among them). Blessings be on all traditions, on all safeguards and circumscriptions! I am most grateful to you men in black gowns, and you, dead, for your leading, for your guardianship; yet after all, the problem remains. The differences are not yet solved. Flowers toss their heads outside the window. I see wild birds, and impulses wilder than the wildest birds strike from my wild heart. My eyes are wild; my lips tight pressed. The bird flies; the flower dances; but I hear always the sullen thud of the waves; and the chained beast stamps on the beach. It stamps and stamps.'",0.04149948657263412,0.06138352635531252,0.041548960778235486,-0.075272984599568,0.08534114378528805,-0.0036068454860218083,0.05307612660283335,0.0708709759401538,-0.046892916512003516,0.08341772401911524,0.011541410810314425,0.021780202285018486,0.5949760826123394,0.4247744169551626,0.6749221171896588,-0.02311354362531489,-0.717237765626101,0.23666091782147305,-0.007885852021044741,0.5863874412872634,0.6103713724810682,0.4130842581685535,-0.07626570559260804,-0.994319548131404,1.0232590560916417,0.18098476554594392,0.265783892020997,1.8466381459109964,0.029629803184295474,0.4421850151020718,-0.06606936126726458

637,637,"'Here are the boxes; here are the cabs. There is Percival in his billycock hat. He will forget me. He will leave my letters lying about among guns and dogs unanswered. I shall send him poems and he will perhaps reply with a picture post card. But it is for that that I love him. I shall propose meeting--under a clock, by some Cross; and shall wait, and he will not come. It is for that that I love him. Oblivious, almost entirely ignorant, he will pass from my life. And I shall pass, incredible as it seems, into other lives; this is only an escapade perhaps, a prelude only. I feel already, though I cannot endure the Doctor's pompous mummery and faked emotions, that things we have only dimly perceived draw near. I shall be free to enter the garden where Fenwick raises his mallet. Those who have despised me shall acknowledge my sovereignty. But by some inscrutable law of my being sovereignty and the possession of power will not be enough; I shall always push through curtains to privacy, and want some whispered words alone. Therefore I go, dubious, but elate; apprehensive of intolerable pain; yet I think bound in my adventuring to conquer after huge suffering, bound, surely, to discover my desire in the end. There, for the last time, I see the statue of our pious founder with the doves about his head. They will wheel for ever about his head, whitening it, while the organ moans in the chapel. So I take my seat; and, when I have found my place in the comer of our reserved compartment, I will shade my eyes with a book to hide one tear; I will shade my eyes to observe; to peep at one face. It is the first day of the summer holidays.'",0.040488090001014505,0.045176724505450405,0.023458900054124744,-0.0844731770359804,0.09516176265632059,-0.02447614602067892,0.04091932401799117,0.0414824394159802,-0.00795662359560546,0.0683023830683469,0.019159082484362162,0.008919744772122288,0.36703208373675206,0.2064090759026845,0.3216842057037507,0.013535744437258886,-0.815231523219147,-0.1667562461610246,0.1416102721500786,0.36486138169125626,0.3204030652432122,0.2591774667374818,-0.5044014142548574,-1.276698456270603,0.4853769997454538,0.17286111653044273,0.07724355663854165,1.6688280816524719,-0.24314427115743797,0.32818425398978845,-0.2969837886009873

670,670,"'I sit snug in my own corner going North,' said Jinny, 'in this roaring express which is yet so smooth that it flattens hedges, lengthens hills. We flash past signal-boxes; we make the earth rock slightly from side to side. The distance closes for ever in a point; and we for ever open the distance wide again. The telegraph poles bob up incessantly; one is felled, another rises. Now we roar and swing into a tunnel. The gentleman pulls up the window. I see reflections on the shining glass which lines the tunnel. I see him lower his paper. He smiles at my reflection in the tunnel. My body instantly of its own accord puts forth a frill under his gaze. My body lives a life of its own. Now the black window glass is green again. We are out of the tunnel. He reads his paper. But we have exchanged the approval of our bodies. There is then a great society of bodies, and mine is introduced; mine has come into the room where the gilt chairs are. Look--all the windows of the villas and their white-tented curtains dance; and the men sitting in the hedges in the cornfields with knotted blue handkerchiefs are aware too, as I am aware, of heat and rapture. One waves as we pass him. There are bowers and arbours in these villa gardens and young men in shirt-sleeves on ladders trimming roses. A man on a horse canters over the field. His horse plunges as we pass. And the rider turns to look at us. We roar again through blackness. And I lie back; I give myself up to rapture; I think that at the end of the tunnel I enter a lamp-lit room with chairs, into one of which I sink, much admired, my dress billowing round me. But behold, looking up, I meet the eyes of a sour woman, who suspects me of rapture. My body shuts in her face, impertinently, like a parasol. I open my body, I shut my body at my will. Life is beginning. I now break into my hoard of life.'",0.07474914886462979,0.07429626278853599,0.049125163911636224,-0.034295804731198934,0.10013068765467562,-0.001961825493085542,0.05508667119951468,0.08583797305352692,0.003526961306953161,0.09087914847075605,0.020638005160433393,0.01316389087197013,0.5819948467057894,0.45162853739032294,0.4907110565046796,0.4947411197318514,-0.27311853865430313,0.16174909632147774,0.6437155259596219,0.7328199213592006,0.6973618646524253,0.5362096913134109,-0.07626570559260804,-0.8571433998395842,0.8546726890720113,0.10514692694458842,0.6068106571837831,1.7167610506463198,0.2096750595562342,0.6416863470485673,0.49416965077011277

England slips by the window, always changing from hill to wood, from rivers and willows to towns again. And I have no firm ground to which I go. Bernard and Neville, Percival, Archie, Larpent and Baker go to Oxford or Cambridge, to Edinburgh, Rome, Paris, Berlin, or to some American University. I go vaguely, to make money vaguely. Therefore a poignant shadow, a keen accent, falls on these golden bristles, on these poppy-red fields, this flowing corn that never overflows its boundaries; but runs rippling to the edge. This is the first day of a new life, another spoke of the rising wheel. But my body passes vagrant as a bird's shadow. I should be transient as the shadow on the meadow, soon fading, soon darkening and dying there where it meets the wood, were it not that I coerce my brain to form in my forehead; I force myself to state, if only in one line of unwritten poetry, this moment; to mark this inch in the long, long history that began in Egypt, in the time of the Pharaohs, when women carried red pitchers to the Nile. I seem already to have lived many thousand years. But if I now shut my eyes, if I fail to realize the meeting-place of past and present, that I sit in a third-class railway carriage full of boys going home for the holidays, human history is defrauded of a moment's vision.",0.07854188600820342,0.0854960852051073,0.05253717792592364,-0.014746854047580554,0.10054267132491335,-0.0004148837635050861,0.06571067575500435,0.084919820752134,0.017942731282442292,0.08635946847969667,0.025831605110651835,-0.008268157462875406,0.6154302792094735,0.5659120619063088,0.4881836668108318,0.3653389201112308,0.0606199972083004,-0.07195608174759112,0.3370234691797657,0.8848844198954429,0.7263586953762108,0.6901164827444826,0.04049857858800531,-0.15493701628009282,1.0317179028931274,0.28436756353214415,0.6202403416507142,1.4819954516620795,0.5523486525937986,0.8126874887169923,0.7941436218938015

717,717,"'Louis and Neville,' said Bernard, 'both sit silent. Both are absorbed. Both feel the presence of other people as a separating wall. But if I find myself in company with other people, words at once make smoke rings--see how phrases at once begin to wreathe off my lips. It seems that a match is set to a fire; something burns. An elderly and apparently prosperous man, a traveller, now gets in. And I at once wish to approach him; I instinctively dislike the sense of his presence, cold, unassimilated, among us. I do not believe in separation. We are not single. Also I wish to add to my collection of valuable observations upon the true nature of human life. My book will certainly run to many volumes, embracing every known variety of man and woman. I fill my mind with whatever happens to be the contents of a room or a railway carriage as one fills a fountain-pen in an inkpot. I have a steady unquenchable thirst. Now I feel by imperceptible signs, which I cannot yet interpret but will later, that his defiance is about to thaw. His solitude shows signs of cracking. He has passed a remark about a country house. A smoke ring issues from my lips (about crops) and circles him, bringing him into contact. The human voice has a disarming quality--(we are not single, we are one). As we exchange these few but amiable remarks about country houses, I furbish him up and make him concrete. He is indulgent as a husband but not faithful; a small builder who employs a few men. In local society he is important; is already a councillor, and perhaps in time will be mayor. He wears a large ornament, like a double tooth torn up by the roots, made of coral, hanging at his watch-chain. Walter J. Trumble is the sort of name that would fit him. He has been in America, on a business trip with his wife, and a double room in a smallish hotel cost him a whole month's wages.",0.08233462315177707,0.08944896370507371,0.06933948061153597,-0.01198944766894399,0.10414501634394323,-0.005328552389586594,0.08234810100227476,0.08334475068123169,0.02874819379999821,0.09649137338263662,0.029373829037946515,-0.014940288461941661,0.7438455107683858,0.7011656533509232,0.7989774279303723,0.5195720927228368,0.10233694955477263,-0.04349985756220772,0.7364743570087381,0.9412046045384955,0.9003396797189246,0.8594139533186617,-0.07626570559260804,-0.16774285787872467,1.168511460663909,0.48795306471288596,0.7304859373933953,1.303179613324749,0.6226683116090775,1.0976893914977002,1.0939259445364464

926,926,"'In a world which contains the present moment,' said Neville, 'why discriminate? Nothing should be named lest by so doing we change it. Let it exist, this bank, this beauty, and I, for one instant, steeped in pleasure. The sun is hot. I see the river. I see trees specked and burnt in the autumn sunlight. Boats float past, through the red, through the green. Far away a bell tolls, but not for death. There are bells that ring for life. A leaf falls, from joy. Oh, I am in love with life! Look how the willow shoots its fine sprays into the air! Look how through them a boat passes, filled with indolent, with unconscious, with powerful young men. They are listening to the gramophone; they are eating fruit out of paper bags. They are tossing the skins of bananas, which then sink eel-like, into the river. All they do is beautiful. There are cruets behind them and ornaments; their rooms are full of oars and oleographs but they have turned all to beauty. That boat passes under the bridge. Another comes. Then another. That is Percival, lounging on the cushions, monolithic, in giant repose. No, it is only one of his satellites, imitating his monolithic, his giant repose. He alone is unconscious of their tricks, and when he catches them at it he buffets them good-humouredly with a blow of his paw. They, too, have passed under the bridge through 'the fountains of the pendant trees', through its fine strokes of yellow and plum colour.",0.11356149230053353,0.09972644780498614,0.168566029571927,0.04119208353399808,0.07535305187757342,0.0009979662040087854,0.15315052977954008,0.1619394236309631,0.15211804886565464,0.12528585381171511,0.04706775519829097,-0.08655487232134877,1.1723773568636857,1.1046716441682745,1.5865218261983838,0.9141080493335633,0.3222848640307064,-0.6114087785614277,-0.6426611096938942,1.1251838743724676,2.0892097393941342,1.7212919853326636,0.07942000664820983,0.46528584838414766,0.06872116457155833,0.7553613564142457,0.873461736216881,-0.29840378088269975,1.1192903898772846,0.8981880595512047,1.3539943140483282

Every time the door opens he looks fixedly at the table--he dare not raise his eyes--then looks for one second and says, ""He has not come.""",0.015203175710523648,0.004462075955796618,-0.045444366525777054,0.03033534739939235,0.03877526593585742,-0.008313130998206738,0.025530193104541906,0.09381572734453696,0.040847598330261276,0.13138735245812946,0.02464498352776847,0.1866921007977253,0.36229110440085166,0.323196611676864,-0.26042777216930335,-0.15213375347484392,0.13299863114846927,0.3376605414708591,0.12377127751196604,-0.24151927296561065,-1.1294384709460683,0.18222407102194593,-0.231951417833426,0.43548834710040457,0.4302348185559798,0.7876364817344347,-0.4550933649757869,2.075555807239837,1.396440480950845,0.5276855859362842,1.0481242938311393

Oh yes, that is not to be denied, and when he takes his seat by Susan, whom he loves, the occasion is crowned. We who yelped like jackals biting at each other's heels now assume the sober and confident air of soldiers in the presence of their captain. We who have been separated by our youth (the oldest is not yet twenty-five), who have sung like eager birds each his own song and tapped with the remorseless and savage egotism of the young our own snail-shell till it cracked (I am engaged), or perched solitary outside some bedroom window and sang of love, of fame and other single experiences so dear to the callow bird with a yellow tuft on its beak, now come nearer; and shuffling closer on our perch in this restaurant where everybody's interests are at variance, and the incessant passage of traffic chafes us with distractions, and the door opening perpetually its glass cage solicits us with myriad temptations and offers insults and wounds to our confidence--sitting together here we love each other and believe in our own endurance.'",0.015203175710523648,0.0044620759557966174,-0.04241266540171029,0.018145490123989024,0.04373414255201151,0.002664313425413989,0.03017846301011457,0.10064474632067827,0.032466527445773455,0.1318175472213165,0.022721674165016876,0.196546190100056,0.3962426929710931,0.35895618811985314,-0.18191743165476293,-0.12275964684772894,0.017413537332242,0.5994421268464858,0.04719427932188844,-0.2640473468228318,-1.0714448094984967,0.2437867875943746,-0.07626570559260804,0.43434362857873654,0.3015976649482147,0.6909697899011391,-0.44788680797599906,1.9222723941841267,1.2801177656488922,0.49918539565821335,1.041045448227744

1689,1689,"'We differ, it may be too profoundly,' said Louis, 'for explanation. But let us attempt it. I smoothed my hair when I came in, hoping to look like the rest of you. But I cannot, for I am not single and entire as you are. I have lived a thousand lives already. Every day I unbury--I dig up. I find relics of myself in the sand that women made thousands of years ago, when I heard songs by the Nile and the chained beast stamping. What you see beside you, this man, this Louis, is only the cinders and refuse of something once splendid. I was an Arab prince; behold my free gestures. I was a great poet in the time of Elizabeth. I was a Duke at the court of Louis the Fourteenth. I am very vain, very confident; I have an immeasurable desire that women should sigh in sympathy. I have eaten no lunch today in order that Susan may think me cadaverous and that Jinny may extend to me the exquisite balm of her sympathy. But while I admire Susan and Percival, I hate the others, because it is for them that I do these antics, smoothing my hair, concealing my accent. I am the little ape who chatters over a nut, and you are the dowdy women with shiny bags of stale buns; I am also the caged tiger, and you are the keepers with red-hot bars.

1693,1693,"'But when you stand in the door,' said Neville, 'you inflict stillness, demanding admiration, and that is a great impediment to the freedom of intercourse. You stand in the door making us notice you. But none of you saw me approach. I came early; I came quickly and directly, here, to sit by the person whom I love. My life has a rapidity that yours lack. I am like a hound on the scent. I hunt from dawn to dusk. Nothing, not the pursuit of perfection through the sand, nor fame, nor money, has meaning for me. I shall have riches; I shall have fame. But I shall never have what I want, for I lack bodily grace and the courage that comes with it. The swiftness of my mind is too strong for my body. I fail before I reach the end and fall in a heap, damp, perhaps disgusting. I excite pity in the crises of life, not love. Therefore I suffer horribly. But I do not suffer, as Louis does, to make myself a spectacle. I have too fine a sense of fact to allow myself these juggleries, these pretences. I see everything--except one thing--with complete clarity. That is my saving. That is what gives my suffering an unceasing excitement. That is what makes me dictate, even when I am silent. And since I am, in one respect, deluded, since the person is always changing, though not the desire, and I do not know in the morning by whom I shall sit at night, I am never stagnant; I rise from my worst disasters, I turn, I change. Pebbles bounce off the mail of my muscular, my extended body. In this pursuit I shall grow old.'",-0.03397598258448128,-0.0441583295937897,-0.08488348356290011,-0.028441951183990576,0.017243257609652462,-0.026789045154738945,0.004264996776320204,0.07404549797160108,0.02095785228818611,0.11300852241409301,0.019796512463909007,0.18569704097129092,-0.25295372033698277,-0.3362183495738741,-0.7817545613087445,-0.193039143705599,-0.44042778299847934,-0.027488691402929193,-0.06566306521262223,-0.9473989204918705,-1.5063972703552808,-0.017854757838447376,-0.6600871264956752,0.35651718511640673,-0.4025970011136901,-0.21554014137228336,-0.6001951016349556,1.7399763573124891,1.318674169586051,0.5846859664924259,0.49676646008303044

Because you have an end in view--one person, is it, to sit beside, an idea is it, your beauty is it?",-0.028792575154930635,-0.03875606231050233,-0.07372231448777888,-0.02752140166989192,0.02575423733383181,-0.01279284305030671,0.01647853176902078,0.07532589549053892,0.012099319953973592,0.11203441280202792,0.020338049111425102,0.18603324878577107,-0.22589860300712672,-0.28205492552902184,-0.7446028760310972,-0.0761012232004528,-0.5053265940624064,0.0975517917973009,0.0927727560327249,-0.8516546065986811,-1.3904099474601388,0.12066135444951717,-0.38763713007424394,0.07288262858006174,-0.28447291378528505,-0.35212949428997936,-0.5334403370170235,1.7484828741293272,1.1198183616345587,0.6131861567704967,0.38522862940369074

1710,1710,"'When I came into the room tonight,' said Susan, 'I stopped, I peered about like an animal with its eyes near to the ground. The smell of carpets and furniture and scent disgusts me. I like to walk through the wet fields alone, or to stop at a gate and watch my setter nose in a circle, and to ask: Where is the hare? I like to be with people who twist herbs, and spit into the fire, and shuffle down long passages in slippers like my father. The only sayings I understand are cries of love, hate, rage and pain. This talking is undressing an old woman whose dress had seemed to be part of her, but now, as we talk, she turns pinkish underneath, and has wrinkled thighs and sagging breasts. When you are silent you are again beautiful. I shall never have anything but natural happiness. It will almost content me. I shall go to bed tired. I shall lie like a field bearing crops in rotation; in the summer heat will dance over me; in the winter I shall be cracked with the cold. But heat and cold will follow each other naturally without my willing or unwilling. My children will carry me on; their teething, their crying, their going to school and coming back will be like the waves of the sea under me. No day will be without its movement. I shall be lifted higher than any of you on the backs of the seasons. I shall possess more than Jinny, more than Rhoda, by the time I die. But on the other hand, where you are various and dimple a million times to the ideas and laughter of others, I shall be sullen, storm-tinted and all one purple. I shall be debased and hide-bound by the bestial and beautiful passion of maternity. I shall push the fortunes of my children unscrupulously. I shall hate those who see their faults. I shall lie basely to help them. I shall let them wall me away from you, from you and from you. Also, I am torn with jealousy. I hate Jinny because she shows me that my hands are red, my nails bitten. I love with such ferocity that it kills me when the object of my love shows by a phrase that he can escape.

Now one wheel sticks in the rut, and at once innumerable natives in loin-cloths swarm round it, chattering excitedly. But they do nothing. Time seems endless, ambition vain. Over all broods a sense of the uselessness of human exertion. There are strange sour smells. An old man in a ditch continues to chew betel and to contemplate his navel. But now, behold, Percival advances; Percival rides a flea-bitten mare, and wears a sun-helmet. By applying the standards of the West, by using the violent language that is natural to him, the bullock-cart is righted in less than five minutes. The Oriental problem is solved.

Like minnows, we who had been shooting this way, that way, all shot round him when he came. Like minnows, conscious of the presence of a great stone, we undulate and eddy contentedly.

1808,1808,"'But soon, too soon,' said Bernard, 'this egotistic exultation fails. Too soon the moment of ravenous identity is over, and the appetite for happiness, and happiness, and still more happiness is glutted. The stone is sunk; the moment is over. Round me there spreads a wide margin of indifference. Now open in my eyes a thousand eyes of curiosity. Anyone now is at liberty to murder Bernard, who is engaged to be married, so long as they leave untouched this margin of unknown territory, this forest of the unknown world. Why, I ask (whispering discreetly), do women dine alone together there? Who are they? And what has brought them on this particular evening to this particular spot? The youth in the corner, judging from the nervous way in which he puts his hand from time to time to the back of his head, is from the country. He is suppliant, and so anxious to respond suitably to the kindness of his father's friend, his host, that he can scarcely enjoy now what he will enjoy very much at about half-past eleven tomorrow morning. I have also seen that lady powder her nose three times in the midst of an absorbing conversation--about love, perhaps, about the unhappiness of their dearest friend perhaps. ""Ah, but the state of my nose!"" she thinks, and out comes her powder-puff, obliterating in its passage all the most fervent feelings of the human heart. There remains, however, the insoluble problem of the solitary man with the eyeglass; of the elderly lady drinking champagne alone. Who and what are these unknown people? I ask. I could make a dozen stories of what he said, of what she said--I can see a dozen pictures. But what are stories? Toys I twist, bubbles I blow, one ring passing through another. And sometimes I begin to doubt if there are stories. What is my story? What is Rhoda's? What is Neville's? There are facts, as, for example: ""The handsome young man in the grey suit, whose reserve contrasted so strangely with the loquacity of the others, now brushed the crumbs from his waistcoat and, with a characteristic gesture at once commanding and benign, made a sign to the waiter, who came instantly and returned a moment later with the bill discreetly folded upon a plate.""",-0.07670748773541101,-0.09989391644331544,-0.12520841083981268,-0.015713003992909185,0.048850443822646715,-0.0413397873072166,-0.05849348867906668,-0.02745979173701387,-0.07295342078037821,0.020922157512486748,0.004502476531823634,0.17803079540735287,-1.2452958675375085,-1.0124172604863313,-1.5396966195326587,-0.19039294268187681,-0.816109305852678,-0.6156450662304578,0.4516511868906256,-1.647646549553827,-1.738371916145566,-0.5257471695609842,-0.8936156948569022,-0.26637007331603163,-1.5120988535816615,-1.3901797085852161,-0.650576714749299,1.0516703019307758,0.5271173402344942,-0.2703197418496986,-1.638330835054424

Honestly now, openly and directly as befits old friends meeting with difficulty, what do we feel on meeting? Sorrow. The door will not open; he will not come. And we are laden. Being now all of us middle-aged, loads are on us. Let us put down our loads. What have you made of life, we ask, and I? You, Bernard; you, Susan; you, Jinny; and Rhoda and Louis? The lists have been posted on the doors. Before we break these rolls, and help ourselves to fish and salad, I feel in my private pocket and find my credentials--what I carry to prove my superiority. I have passed. I have papers in my private pocket that prove it. But your eyes, Susan, full of turnips and cornfields, disturb me. These papers in my private pocket--the clamour that proves that I have passed--make a faint sound like that of a man clapping in an empty field to scare away rooks. Now it has died down altogether, under Susan's stare (the clapping, the reverberation that I have made), and I hear only the wind sweeping over the ploughed land and some bird singing--perhaps some intoxicated lark.",-0.02462056429699965,-0.044817142677117436,-0.055048638331223275,-0.06997823408212846,-0.01041658912874696,-0.06637579462091604,0.010636741182792805,-0.011766910937714063,-0.0028638523576794833,-0.05409815091965729,0.002952477580085148,-0.08708912041061592,-0.6627687247533615,-0.8732922027530879,-0.9625829920164852,-0.17632717631209108,-1.0315490135566026,-2.2047707492417423,-1.2155177371404726,-0.924870846634648,-0.6364923486417127,0.2437867875943746,-1.360672831579356,-0.48781429631699913,-0.1529719134631733,-0.9636724244705525,-1.2526381269778635,-1.8894329370642378,-1.176380823249887,-2.151332300202372,-1.4156631297516733

3103,3103,"'Let us stay for a moment,' said Bernard, 'before we go. Let us pace the terrace by the river almost alone. It is nearly bed-time. People have gone home. Now how comforting it is to watch the lights coming out in the bedrooms of small shopkeepers on the other side of the river. There is one--there is another. What do you think their takings have been today? Only just enough to pay for the rent, for light and food and the children's clothing. But just enough. What a sense of the tolerableness of life the lights in the bedrooms of small shopkeepers give us! Saturday comes, and there is just enough to pay perhaps for seats at the Pictures. Perhaps before they put out the light they go into the little garden and look at the giant rabbit couched in its wooden hut. That is the rabbit they will have for Sunday dinner. Then they put out the light. Then they sleep. And for thousands of people sleep is nothing but warmth and silence and one moment's sport with some fantastic dream.",-0.00641542600784613,-0.01714699317735282,-0.043958828909675306,-0.009095780165457312,0.10322056518145868,0.016995600881536514,0.040513779705665755,-0.041204211241172545,0.09370762447127445,-0.009757302678435434,0.03723833714675627,0.11037781233718766,-0.22504927491976434,0.20600815897056374,-0.7930175202522778,1.0166244902634702,-0.8517254676230923,0.7263695361638045,0.7174181277048081,-0.31473551300157815,-0.7234828408130697,0.459256295597875,0.31294857500943685,0.9084921041279259,0.23746511376377674,1.1007712390328648,-0.742033644333169,0.020135073695186797,-0.1311752055223535,-1.0968252599137518,-1.037054328371368

3241,3241,"'But let me dip again and bring up in my spoon another of these minute objects which we call optimistically, ""characters of our friends""--Louis. He sat staring at the preacher. His being seemed conglobulated in his brow, his lips were pressed; his eyes were fixed, but suddenly they flashed with laughter. Also he suffered from chilblains, the penalty of an imperfect circulation. Unhappy, unfriended, in exile he would sometimes, in moments of confidence, describe how the surf swept over the beaches of his home. The remorseless eye of youth fixed itself upon his swollen joints. Yes, but we were also quick to perceive how cutting, how apt, how severe he was, how naturally, when we lay under the elm trees pretending to watch cricket, we waited his approval, seldom given. His ascendancy was resented, as Percival's was adored. Prim, suspicious, lifting his feet like a crane, there was yet a legend that he had smashed a door with his naked fist. But his peak was too bare, too stony for that kind of mist to cling to it. He was without those simple attachments by which one is connected with another. He remained aloof; enigmatic; a scholar capable of that inspired accuracy which has something formidable about it. My phrases (how to describe the moon) did not meet with his approval. On the other hand, he envied me to the point of desperation for being at my ease with servants. Not that the sense of his own deserts failed him. That was commensurate with his respect for discipline. Hence his success, finally. His life, though, was not happy.

3612,3612,"Then Jinny--entertaining, no doubt, some new young man. They reached the crisis of the usual conversation. The room would be darkened; chairs arranged. For she still sought the moment. Without illusions, hard and clear as crystal, she rode at the day with her breast bared. She let its spikes pierce her. When the lock whitened on her forehead she twisted it fearlessly among the rest. So when they come to bury her nothing will be out of order. Bits of ribbons will be found curled up. But still the door opens. Who is coming in? she asks, and rises to meet him, prepared, as on those first spring nights when the tree under the big London houses where respectable citizens were going soberly to bed scarcely sheltered her love; and the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor, her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied. Our friends, how seldom visited, how little known--it is true; and yet, when I meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what I call ""my life"", it is not one life that I look back upon; I am not one person; I am many people; I do not altogether know who I am--Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda, or Louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs.",-0.00022062200667593228,0.024094705838962935,0.04475338449644894,0.08998171542681155,0.013431571294770116,0.008111541295953937,0.018401308599420213,-0.014104089216297543,0.05757859971351089,-0.05819623449547209,0.045383299935601855,0.10953597272151347,0.3040674399816245,0.3000961463140218,1.092732929093248,-0.7184042335679451,1.2462151127505576,0.3192827295565086,0.1012495223625348,0.2841357837028833,0.20441574234806997,0.22839610845126743,0.07942000664820983,-0.06232041357222657,-2.5685526666619882,-1.031208335957601,-0.108223231324402,-0.5416499973775067,-0.7756295638656723,-1.1538256404698937,-0.7677801856800185

3766,3766,Am I one and distinct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3767,3767,I do not know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is the old brute, too, the savage, the hairy man who dabbles his fingers in ropes of entrails; and gobbles and belches; whose speech is guttural, visceral--well, he is here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3790,3790,"He has given a greener glow to green things, has held his torch with its red flames, its thick and smarting smoke, behind every leaf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3791,3791,He has lit up the cool garden even.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3792,3792,He has brandished his torch in murky by-streets where girls suddenly seem to shine with a red and intoxicating translucency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3801,3801,"'Immeasurably receptive, holding everything, trembling with fullness, yet clear, contained--so my being seems, now that desire urges it no more out and away; now that curiosity no longer dyes it a thousand colours. It lies deep, tideless, immune, now that he is dead, the man I called ""Bernard"", the man who kept a book in his pocket in which he made notes--phrases for the moon, notes of features; how people looked, turned, dropped their cigarette ends; under B, butterfly powder, under D, ways of naming death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3810,3810,The birds sing in chorus; deep tunnels run between the stalks of flowers; the house is whitened; the sleeper stretches; gradually all is astir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3875,3875,I need a howl; a cry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3876,3876,When the storm crosses the marsh and sweeps over me where I lie in the ditch unregarded I need no words.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3877,3877,Nothing neat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3878,3878,Nothing that comes down with all its feet on the floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3879,3879,"None of those resonances and lovely echoes that break and chime from nerve to nerve in our breasts, making wild music, false phrases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3880,3880,I have done with phrases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3881,3881,"'How much better is silence; the coffee-cup, the table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3882,3882,How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
