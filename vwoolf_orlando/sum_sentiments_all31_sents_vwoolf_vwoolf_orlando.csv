0,0,"He--for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it--was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which swung from the rafters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,"It was the colour of an old football, and more or less the shape of one, save for the sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse, dry hair, like the hair on a cocoanut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2,"Orlando's father, or perhaps his grandfather, had struck it from the shoulders of a vast Pagan who had started up under the moon in the barbarian fields of Africa; and now it swung, gently, perpetually, in the breeze which never ceased blowing through the attic rooms of the gigantic house of the lord who had slain him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,3,"Orlando's fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck many heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them back to hang from the rafters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4,"So too would Orlando, he vowed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,5,"But since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother and the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,6,"Sometimes he cut the cord so that the skull bumped on the floor and he had to string it up again, fastening it with some chivalry almost out of reach so that his enemy grinned at him through shrunk, black lips triumphantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,"The skull swung to and fro, for the house, at the top of which he lived, was so vast that there seemed trapped in it the wind itself, blowing this way, blowing that way, winter and summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,8,The green arras with the hunters on it moved perpetually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,9,His fathers had been noble since they had been at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10,They came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,11,"Were not the bars of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the floor, made by the sun falling through the stained glass of a vast coat of arms in the window?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,12,Orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of an heraldic leopard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,"When he put his hand on the window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red, blue, and yellow like a butterfly's wing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,14,"Thus, those who like symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe that though the shapely legs, the handsome body, and the well-set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light, Orlando's face, as he threw the window open, was lit solely by the sun itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,15,"A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to find.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,16,"Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,17,"Never need she vex herself, nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,18,"From deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after, till they reach whatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,19,"Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such career.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,20,The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,21,The lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,22,"Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to the head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,23,"But, alas, that these catalogues of youthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,24,"Alas, that people are seldom born devoid of all three; for directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were his temples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,25,"Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,26,"Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,27,"Sights disturbed him, like that of his mother, a very beautiful lady in green walking out to feed the peacocks with Twitchett, her maid, behind her; sights exalted him--the birds and the trees; and made him in love with death--the evening sky, the homing rooks; and so, mounting up the spiral stairway into his brain--which was a roomy one--all these sights, and the garden sounds too, the hammer beating, the wood chopping, began that riot and confusion of the passions and emotions which every good biographer detests, But to continue--Orlando slowly drew in his head, sat down at the table, and, with the half-conscious air of one doing what they do every day of their lives at this hour, took out a writing book labelled 'Aethelbert: A Tragedy in Five Acts,' and dipped an old stained goose quill in the ink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,28,Soon he had covered ten pages and more with poetry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,29,"He was fluent, evidently, but he was abstract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,30,"Vice, Crime, Misery were the personages of his drama; there were Kings and Queens of impossible territories; horrid plots confounded them; noble sentiments suffused them; there was never a word said as he himself would have said it, but all was turned with a fluency and sweetness which, considering his age--he was not yet seventeen--and that the sixteenth century had still some years of its course to run, were remarkable enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,31,"At last, however, he came to a halt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,32,"He was describing, as all young poets are for ever describing, nature, and in order to match the shade of green precisely he looked (and here he showed more audacity than most) at the thing itself, which happened to be a laurel bush growing beneath the window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,33,"After that, of course, he could write no more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,34,"Green in nature is one thing, green in literature another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,35,Nature and letters seem to have a natural antipathy; bring them together and they tear each other to pieces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,36,The shade of green Orlando now saw spoilt his rhyme and split his metre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,37,"Moreover, nature has tricks of her own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,38,"Once look out of a window at bees among flowers, at a yawning dog, at the sun setting, once think 'how many more suns shall I see set', etc. etc. (the thought is too well known to be worth writing out) and one drops the pen, takes one's cloak, strides out of the room, and catches one's foot on a painted chest as one does so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,For Orlando was a trifle clumsy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,40,He was careful to avoid meeting anyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,41,"There was Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,42,He hid behind a tree till he had passed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,43,He let himself out at a little gate in the garden wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,44,"He skirted all stables, kennels, breweries, carpenters' shops, washhouses, places where they make tallow candles, kill oxen, forge horse-shoes, stitch jerkins--for the house was a town ringing with men at work at their various crafts--and gained the ferny path leading uphill through the park unseen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,45,There is perhaps a kinship among qualities; one draws another along with it; and the biographer should here call attention to the fact that this clumsiness is often mated with a love of solitude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,46,"Having stumbled over a chest, Orlando naturally loved solitary places, vast views, and to feel himself for ever and ever and ever alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,47,"So, after a long silence, 'I am alone', he breathed at last, opening his lips for the first time in this record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,48,"He had walked very quickly uphill through ferns and hawthorn bushes, startling deer and wild birds, to a place crowned by a single oak tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,49,"It was very high, so high indeed that nineteen English counties could be seen beneath; and on clear days thirty or perhaps forty, if the weather was very fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,50,"Sometimes one could see the English Channel, wave reiterating upon wave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,51,"Rivers could be seen and pleasure boats gliding on them; and galleons setting out to sea; and armadas with puffs of smoke from which came the dull thud of cannon firing; and forts on the coast; and castles among the meadows; and here a watch tower; and there a fortress; and again some vast mansion like that of Orlando's father, massed like a town in the valley circled by walls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,52,"To the east there were the spires of London and the smoke of the city; and perhaps on the very sky line, when the wind was in the right quarter, the craggy top and serrated edges of Snowdon herself showed mountainous among the clouds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,53,"For a moment Orlando stood counting, gazing, recognizing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,54,That was his father's house; that his uncle's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,55,His aunt owned those three great turrets among the trees there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,56,"The heath was theirs and the forest; the pheasant and the deer, the fox, the badger, and the butterfly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,57,"He sighed profoundly, and flung himself--there was a passion in his movements which deserves the word--on the earth at the foot of the oak tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,58,"He loved, beneath all this summer transiency, to feel the earth's spine beneath him; for such he took the hard root of the oak tree to be; or, for image followed image, it was the back of a great horse that he was riding, or the deck of a tumbling ship--it was anything indeed, so long as it was hard, for he felt the need of something which he could attach his floating heart to; the heart that tugged at his side; the heart that seemed filled with spiced and amorous gales every evening about this time when he walked out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,59,"To the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there, gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself; the little leaves hung, the deer stopped; the pale summer clouds stayed; his limbs grew heavy on the ground; and he lay so still that by degrees the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past, as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer's evening were woven web-like about his body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,60,"After an hour or so--the sun was rapidly sinking, the white clouds had turned red, the hills were violet, the woods purple, the valleys black--a trumpet sounded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,61,Orlando leapt to his feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,62,The shrill sound came from the valley.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,63,"It came from a dark spot down there; a spot compact and mapped out; a maze; a town, yet girt about with walls; it came from the heart of his own great house in the valley, which, dark before, even as he looked and the single trumpet duplicated and reduplicated itself with other shriller sounds, lost its darkness and became pierced with lights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,64,"Some were small hurrying lights, as if servants dashed along corridors to answer summonses; others were high and lustrous lights, as if they burnt in empty banqueting-halls made ready to receive guests who had not come; and others dipped and waved and sank and rose, as if held in the hands of troops of serving men, bending, kneeling, rising, receiving, guarding, and escorting with all dignity indoors a great Princess alighting from her chariot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,65,Coaches turned and wheeled in the courtyard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,66,Horses tossed their plumes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,67,The Queen had come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,68,Orlando looked no more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,69,He dashed downhill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,70,He let himself in at a wicket gate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,71,He tore up the winding staircase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,He reached his room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,73,"He tossed his stockings to one side of the room, his jerkin to the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,74,He dipped his head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,75,He scoured his hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,76,He pared his finger nails.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,77,"With no more than six inches of looking-glass and a pair of old candles to help him, he had thrust on crimson breeches, lace collar, waistcoat of taffeta, and shoes with rosettes on them as big as double dahlias in less than ten minutes by the stable clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,He was ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,He was flushed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,80,"He was excited, But he was terribly late.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,81,"By short cuts known to him, he made his way now through the vast congeries of rooms and staircases to the banqueting-hall, five acres distant on the other side of the house.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,82,"But half-way there, in the back quarters where the servants lived, he stopped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,"The door of Mrs Stewkley's sitting-room stood open--she was gone, doubtless, with all her keys to wait upon her mistress. But there, sitting at the servant's dinner table with a tankard beside him and paper in front of him, sat a rather fat, shabby man, whose ruff was a thought dirty, and whose clothes were of hodden brown. He held a pen in his hand, but he was not writing. He seemed in the act of rolling some thought up and down, to and fro in his mind till it gathered shape or momentum to his liking. His eyes, globed and clouded like some green stone of curious texture, were fixed. He did not see Orlando. For all his hurry, Orlando stopped dead. Was this a poet? Was he writing poetry? 'Tell me', he wanted to say, 'everything in the whole world'--for he had the wildest, most absurd, extravagant ideas about poets and poetry--but how speak to a man who does not see you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,"who sees ogres, satyrs, perhaps the depths of the sea instead?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,85,"So Orlando stood gazing while the man turned his pen in his fingers, this way and that way; and gazed and mused; and then, very quickly, wrote half-a-dozen lines and looked up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,86,"Whereupon Orlando, overcome with shyness, darted off and reached the banqueting-hall only just in time to sink upon his knees and, hanging his head in confusion, to offer a bowl of rose water to the great Queen herself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,87,Such was his shyness that he saw no more of her than her ringed hands in water; but it was enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,88,"It was a memorable hand; a thin hand with long fingers always curling as if round orb or sceptre; a nervous, crabbed, sickly hand; a commanding hand too; a hand that had only to raise itself for a head to fall; a hand, he guessed, attached to an old body that smelt like a cupboard in which furs are kept in camphor; which body was yet caparisoned in all sorts of brocades and gems; and held itself very upright though perhaps in pain from sciatica; and never flinched though strung together by a thousand fears; and the Queen's eyes were light yellow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,89,"All this he felt as the great rings flashed in the water and then something pressed his hair--which, perhaps, accounts for his seeing nothing more likely to be of use to a historian. And in truth, his mind was such a welter of opposites--of the night and the blazing candles, of the shabby poet and the great Queen, of silent fields and the clatter of serving men--that he could see nothing; or only a hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,90,"By the same showing, the Queen herself can have seen only a head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,91,"But if it is possible from a hand to deduce a body, informed with all the attributes of a great Queen, her crabbedness, courage, frailty, and terror, surely a head can be as fertile, looked down upon from a chair of state by a lady whose eyes were always, if the waxworks at the Abbey are to be trusted, wide open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,92,"The long, curled hair, the dark head bent so reverently, so innocently before her, implied a pair of the finest legs that a young nobleman has ever stood upright upon; and violet eyes; and a heart of gold; and loyalty and manly charm--all qualities which the old woman loved the more the more they failed her. For she was growing old and worn and bent before her time. The sound of cannon was always in her ears. She saw always the glistening poison drop and the long stiletto. As she sat at table she listened; she heard the guns in the Channel; she dreaded--was that a curse, was that a whisper?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,93,"Innocence, simplicity, were all the more dear to her for the dark background she set them against.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,94,"And it was that same night, so tradition has it, when Orlando was sound asleep, that she made over formally, putting her hand and seal finally to the parchment, the gift of the great monastic house that had been the Archbishop's and then the King's to Orlando's father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,95,Orlando slept all night in ignorance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,96,He had been kissed by a queen without knowing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,97,"And perhaps, for women's hearts are intricate, it was his ignorance and the start he gave when her lips touched him that kept the memory of her young cousin (for they had blood in common) green in her mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,98,"At any rate, two years of this quiet country life had not passed, and Orlando had written no more perhaps than twenty tragedies and a dozen histories and a score of sonnets when a message came that he was to attend the Queen at Whitehall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,99,"'Here', she said, watching him advance down the long gallery towards her, 'comes my innocent!' (There was a serenity about him always which had the look of innocence when, technically, the word was no longer applicable.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,100,'Come!' she said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,101,She was sitting bolt upright beside the fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,102,And she held him a foot's pace from her and looked him up and down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,103,Was she matching her speculations the other night with the truth now visible?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,Did she find her guesses justified?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,105,"Eyes, mouth, nose, breast, hips, hands--she ran them over; her lips twitched visibly as she looked; but when she saw his legs she laughed out loud. He was the very image of a noble gentleman. But inwardly? She flashed her yellow hawk's eyes upon him as if she would pierce his soul. The young man withstood her gaze blushing only a damask rose as became him. Strength, grace, romance, folly, poetry, youth--she read him like a page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,106,"Instantly she plucked a ring from her finger (the joint was swollen rather) and as she fitted it to his, named him her Treasurer and Steward; next hung about him chains of office; and bidding him bend his knee, tied round it at the slenderest part the jewelled order of the Garter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,107,Nothing after that was denied him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,108,When she drove in state he rode at her carriage door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,109,She sent him to Scotland on a sad embassy to the unhappy Queen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,110,He was about to sail for the Polish wars when she recalled him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,111,For how could she bear to think of that tender flesh torn and that curly head rolled in the dust?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,She kept him with her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,113,"At the height of her triumph when the guns were booming at the Tower and the air was thick enough with gunpowder to make one sneeze and the huzzas of the people rang beneath the windows, she pulled him down among the cushions where her women had laid her (she was so worn and old) and made him bury his face in that astonishing composition--she had not changed her dress for a month--which smelt for all the world, he thought, recalling his boyish memory, like some old cabinet at home where his mother's furs were stored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,114,"He rose, half suffocated from the embrace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,115,"'This', she breathed, 'is my victory!'--even as a rocket roared up and dyed her cheeks scarlet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,For the old woman loved him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,117,"And the Queen, who knew a man when she saw one, though not, it is said, in the usual way, plotted for him a splendid ambitious career.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,118,"Lands were given him, houses assigned him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,119,He was to be the son of her old age; the limb of her infirmity; the oak tree on which she leant her degradation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"She croaked out these promises and strange domineering tendernesses (they were at Richmond now) sitting bolt upright in her stiff brocades by the fire which, however high they piled it, never kept her warm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,121,"Meanwhile, the long winter months drew on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,122,Every tree in the Park was lined with frost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,123,The river ran sluggishly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,124,"One day when the snow was on the ground and the dark panelled rooms were full of shadows and the stags were barking in the Park, she saw in the mirror, which she kept for fear of spies always by her, through the door, which she kept for fear of murderers always open, a boy--could it be Orlando?--kissing a girl--who in the Devil's name was the brazen hussy?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,Snatching at her golden-hilted sword she struck violently at the mirror.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"The glass crashed; people came running; she was lifted and set in her chair again; but she was stricken after that and groaned much, as her days wore to an end, of man's treachery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,127,"It was Orlando's fault perhaps; yet, after all, are we to blame Orlando?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,128,The age was the Elizabethan; their morals were not ours; nor their poets; nor their climate; nor their vegetables even.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,129,Everything was different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,130,"The weather itself, the heat and cold of summer and winter, was, we may believe, of another temper altogether.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,The brilliant amorous day was divided as sheerly from the night as land from water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,132,Sunsets were redder and more intense; dawns were whiter and more auroral.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,133,Of our crepuscular half-lights and lingering twilights they knew nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,134,"The rain fell vehemently, or not at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,135,The sun blazed or there was darkness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,"Translating this to the spiritual regions as their wont is, the poets sang beautifully how roses fade and petals fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,137,The moment is brief they sang; the moment is over; one long night is then to be slept by all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,138,"As for using the artifices of the greenhouse or conservatory to prolong or preserve these fresh pinks and roses, that was not their way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,139,The withered intricacies and ambiguities of our more gradual and doubtful age were unknown to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,Violence was all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,141,The flower bloomed and faded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,142,The sun rose and sank.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,143,The lover loved and went.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,144,"And what the poets said in rhyme, the young translated into practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,145,"Girls were roses, and their seasons were short as the flowers'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,146,Plucked they must be before nightfall; for the day was brief and the day was all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About the first there might be some doubt; the second she found without the least difficulty two days after her arrival. It was a Tuesday that she came to town. On Thursday she went for a walk in the Mall, as was then the habit of persons of quality. She had not made more than a turn or two of the avenue before she was observed by a little knot of vulgar people who go there to spy upon their betters. As she came past them, a common woman carrying a child at her breast stepped forward, peered familiarly into Orlando's face, and cried out, 'Lawk upon us, if it ain't the Lady Orlando!' Her companions came crowding round, and Orlando found herself in a moment the centre of a mob of staring citizens and tradesmen's wives, all eager to gaze upon the heroine of the celebrated lawsuit. Such was the interest that the case excited in the minds of the common people. She might, indeed, have found herself gravely discommoded by the pressure of the crowd--she had forgotten that ladies are not supposed to walk in public places alone--had not a tall gentleman at once stepped forward and offered her the protection of his arm.",0.0930573256713487,0.11872979674101311,0.11246056776562888,0.014958395521435854,-0.007659332600081413,0.05243818198837066,0.0833298133281267,0.10941724355782516,0.12790081578854773,0.06372524605908113,0.1630631687393053,-0.15341093248239301,0.4259125194229267,0.45675230720311444,0.6784321433667174,-0.37828296626790764,-0.03655250289339443,0.4229276249666506,0.25378095870469436,0.8067317614448006,1.1586442167668194,0.5565208477683504,0.4450956331251721,-0.40290768859157255,-0.18381258660147,0.31345635533515515,0.9209304547395337,-0.028030881500548634,0.3128685199265062,-0.15104828278286142,-0.04324438223374665

2417,2417,"But Orlando was a woman--Lord Palmerston had just proved it. And when we are writing the life of a woman, we may, it is agreed, waive our demand for action, and substitute love instead. Love, the poet has said, is woman's whole existence. And if we look for a moment at Orlando writing at her table, we must admit that never was there a woman more fitted for that calling. Surely, since she is a woman, and a beautiful woman, and a woman in the prime of life, she will soon give over this pretence of writing and thinking and begin at least to think of a gamekeeper (and as long as she thinks of a man, nobody objects to a woman thinking). And then she will write him a little note (and as long as she writes little notes nobody objects to a woman writing either) and make an assignation for Sunday dusk and Sunday dusk will come; and the gamekeeper will whistle under the window--all of which is, of course, the very stuff of life and the only possible subject for fiction.",0.04243365472343398,0.04152181737476655,0.03041839803934818,0.16433800456591324,0.034778815593208876,0.020344342144931554,-0.11711509102005453,-0.050428035945987215,-0.031232257821541445,0.03343550787080487,-0.08153950546008525,-0.0979110295038309,0.337497548608913,0.2801681404450535,0.2879900258649281,0.11897430882058693,1.3859505626275774,0.5808991311434053,-0.09947334692779337,0.273096910616738,0.6455649770826005,-0.25805307356566126,0.05184162968277627,0.8052176228603992,-0.6425434537741709,-0.48654459475383505,0.7431093207619326,-0.18531919855956522,0.22634573685624132,-0.06210313003596967,1.2692496548168355

But she had pitched herself, without knowing it, not far from the Serpentine. The barking of a thousand dogs sounded in her ears. Carriage wheels rushed ceaselessly in a circle. Leaves sighed overhead. Now and again a braided skirt and a pair of tight scarlet trousers crossed the grass within a few steps of her. Once a gigantic rubber ball bounced on the newspaper. Violets, oranges, reds, and blues broke through the interstices of the leaves and sparkled in the emerald on her finger. She read a sentence and looked up at the sky; she looked up at the sky and looked down at the newspaper. Life? Literature? One to be made into the other? But how monstrously difficult! For--here came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers--how would Addison have put that? Here came two dogs dancing on their hind legs. How would Lamb have described that?

2856,2856,"Gently opening a door, she stood on the threshold so that (as she fancied) the room could not see her and watched the tapestry rising and falling on the eternal faint breeze which never failed to move it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2857,2857,Still the hunter rode; still Daphne flew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2858,2858,"The heart still beat, she thought, however faintly, however far withdrawn; the frail indomitable heart of the immense building.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2861,2861,The sight made her gloomy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2862,2862,She unhooked the rope that fenced them off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2863,2863,"She sat on the Queen's chair; she opened a manuscript book lying on Lady Betty's table; she stirred her fingers in the aged rose leaves; she brushed her short hair with King James' silver brushes: she bounced up and down upon his bed (but no King would ever sleep there again, for all Louise's new sheets) and pressed her cheek against the worn silver counterpane that lay upon it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2864,2864,"But everywhere were little lavender bags to keep the moth out and printed notices, 'Please do not touch', which, though she had put them there herself, seemed to rebuke her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2865,2865,"The house was no longer hers entirely, she sighed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2866,2866,It belonged to time now; to history; was past the touch and control of the living.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2867,2867,"Never would beer be spilt here any more, she thought (she was in the bedroom that had been old Nick Greene's), or holes burnt in the carpet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2868,2868,Never two hundred servants come running and brawling down the corridors with warming pans and great branches for the great fireplaces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2869,2869,Never would ale be brewed and candles made and saddles fashioned and stone shaped in the workshops outside the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2870,2870,Hammers and mallets were silent now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2871,2871,Chairs and beds were empty; tankards of silver and gold were locked in glass cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2872,2872,The great wings of silence beat up and down the empty house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2873,2873,"So she sat at the end of the gallery with her dogs couched round her, in Queen Elizabeth's hard armchair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2874,2874,The gallery stretched far away to a point where the light almost failed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2875,2875,It was as a tunnel bored deep into the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2876,2876,"As her eyes peered down it, she could see people laughing and talking; the great men she had known; Dryden, Swift, and Pope; and statesmen in colloquy; and lovers dallying in the window-seats; and people eating and drinking at the long tables; and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making them sneeze and cough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2877,2877,"Still further down, she saw sets of splendid dancers formed for the quadrille.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2878,2878,"A fluty, frail, but nevertheless stately music began to play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2879,2879,An organ boomed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2880,2880,A coffin was borne into the chapel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2881,2881,A marriage procession came out of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2882,2882,Armed men with helmets left for the wars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2883,2883,They brought banners back from Flodden and Poitiers and stuck them on the wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2884,2884,"The long gallery filled itself thus, and still peering further, she thought she could make out at the very end, beyond the Elizabethans and the Tudors, some one older, further, darker, a cowled figure, monastic, severe, a monk, who went with his hands clasped, and a book in them, murmuring--",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2885,2885,"Like thunder, the stable clock struck four.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2886,2886,Never did any earthquake so demolish a whole town.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2887,2887,The gallery and all its occupants fell to powder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2888,2888,"Her own face, that had been dark and sombre as she gazed, was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2889,2889,In this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2890,2890,"She saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue sheen on their bodies; she saw a knot in the wood where her foot was, and her dog's ear twitching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2891,2891,"At the same time, she heard a bough creaking in the garden, a sheep coughing in the park, a swift screaming past the window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2892,2892,Her own body quivered and tingled as if suddenly stood naked in a hard frost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2893,2893,"Yet, she kept, as she had not done when the clock struck ten in London, complete composure (for she was now one and entire, and presented, it may be, a larger surface to the shock of time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2894,2894,"She rose, but without precipitation, called her dogs, and went firmly but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2895,2895,Here the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2896,2896,She noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2897,2897,She saw the intricacy of the twigs of every tree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2898,2898,Each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of veins and petals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2899,2899,"She saw Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the path, and every button on his gaiters was visible; she saw Betty and Prince, the cart horses, and never had she marked so clearly the white star on Betty's forehead, and the three long hairs that fell down below the rest on Prince's tail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2900,2900,Out in the quadrangle the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new photograph; she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a dance tune that people were listening to in the red velvet opera house at Vienna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2901,2901,"Braced and strung up by the present moment she was also strangely afraid, as if whenever the gulf of time gaped and let a second through some unknown danger might come with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2902,2902,The tension was too relentless and too rigorous to be endured long without discomfort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2903,2903,"She walked more briskly than she liked, as if her legs were moved for her, through the garden and out into the park.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2904,2904,"Here she forced herself, by a great effort, to stop by the carpenter's shop, and to stand stock-still watching Joe Stubbs fashion a cart wheel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2905,2905,She was standing with her eye fixed on his hand when the quarter struck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2906,2906,"It hurtled through her like a meteor, so hot that no fingers can hold it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2907,2907,She saw with disgusting vividness that the thumb on Joe's right hand was without a finger nail and there was a raised saucer of pink flesh where the nail should have been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2908,2908,"The sight was so repulsive that she felt faint for a moment, but in that moment's darkness, when her eyelids flickered, she was relieved of the pressure of the present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2909,2909,"There was something strange in the shadow that the flicker of her eyes cast, something which (as anyone can test for himself by looking now at the sky) is always absent from the present--whence its terror, its nondescript character--something one trembles to pin through the body with a name and call beauty, for it has no body, is as a shadow without substance or quality of its own, yet has the power to change whatever it adds itself to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2910,2910,"This shadow now, while she flickered her eye in her faintness in the carpenter's shop, stole out, and attaching itself to the innumerable sights she had been receiving, composed them into something tolerable, comprehensible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2911,2911,Her mind began to toss like the sea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2912,2912,"Yes, she thought, heaving a deep sigh of relief, as she turned from the carpenter's shop to climb the hill, I can begin to live again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2913,2913,"I am by the Serpentine, she thought, the little boat is climbing through the white arch of a thousand deaths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2914,2914,I am about to understand...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2915,2915,"Those were her words, spoken quite distinctly, but we cannot conceal the fact that she was now a very indifferent witness to the truth of what was before her and might easily have mistaken a sheep for a cow, or an old man called Smith for one who was called Jones and was no relation of his whatever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2916,2916,"For the shadow of faintness which the thumb without a nail had cast had deepened now, at the back of her brain (which is the part furthest from sight), into a pool where things dwell in darkness so deep that what they are we scarcely know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2917,2917,"She now looked down into this pool or sea in which everything is reflected--and, indeed, some say that all our most violent passions, and art and religion, are the reflections which we see in the dark hollow at the back of the head when the visible world is obscured for the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2918,2918,"She looked there now, long, deeply, profoundly, and immediately the ferny path up the hill along which she was walking became not entirely a path, but partly the Serpentine; the hawthorn bushes were partly ladies and gentlemen sitting with card-cases and gold-mounted canes; the sheep were partly tall Mayfair houses; everything was partly something else, as if her mind had become a forest with glades branching here and there; things came nearer, and further, and mingled and separated and made the strangest alliances and combinations in an incessant chequer of light and shade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2919,2919,"Except when Canute, the elk-hound, chased a rabbit and so reminded her that it must be about half past four--it was indeed twenty-three minutes to six--she forgot the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2920,2920,"The ferny path led, with many turns and windings, higher and higher to the oak tree, which stood on the top.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2921,2921,"The tree had grown bigger, sturdier, and more knotted since she had known it, somewhere about the year , but it was still in the prime of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2922,2922,The little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering thickly on its branches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2923,2923,"Flinging herself on the ground, she felt the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way and that beneath her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2924,2924,She liked to think that she was riding the back of the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2925,2925,She liked to attach herself to something hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2926,2926,"As she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her leather jacket--her poem 'The Oak Tree'. 'I should have brought a trowel,' she reflected. The earth was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could do as she meant and bury the book here. Besides, the dogs would dig it up. No luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations, she thought. Perhaps it would be as well then to do without them. She had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to speak over the book as she buried it. (It was a copy of the first edition, signed by author and artist.) 'I bury this as a tribute,' she was going to have said, 'a return to the land of what the land has given me,' but Lord! once one began mouthing words aloud, how silly they sounded! She was reminded of old Greene getting upon a platform the other day comparing her with Milton (save for his blindness) and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas. She had thought then, of the oak tree here on its hill, and what has that got to do with this, she had wondered? What has praise and fame to do with poetry? What has seven editions (the book had already gone into no less) got to do with the value of it? Was not writing poetry a secret transaction, a voice answering a voice? So that all this chatter and praise and blame and meeting people who admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill suited as could be to the thing itself--a voice answering a voice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2927,2927,"What could have been more secret, she thought, more slow, and like the intercourse of lovers, than the stammering answer she had made all these years to the old crooning song of the woods, and the farms and the brown horses standing at the gate, neck to neck, and the smithy and the kitchen and the fields, so laboriously bearing wheat, turnips, grass, and the garden blowing irises and fritillaries?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2928,2928,"So she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground, and watched the vast view, varied like an ocean floor this evening with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2929,2929,There was a village with a church tower among elm trees; a grey domed manor house in a park; a spark of light burning on some glass-house; a farmyard with yellow corn stacks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2930,2930,"The fields were marked with black tree clumps, and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands, and there was the gleam of a river, and then hills again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2931,2931,In the far distance Snowdon's crags broke white among the clouds; she saw the far Scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the Hebrides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2932,2932,She listened for the sound of gun-firing out at sea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2933,2933,No--only the wind blew.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2934,2934,There was no war to-day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2935,2935,Drake had gone; Nelson had gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2936,2936,"'And there', she thought, letting her eyes, which had been looking at these far distances, drop once more to the land beneath her, 'was my land once: that Castle between the downs was mine; and all that moor running almost to the sea was mine.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2937,2937,"Here the landscape (it must have been some trick of the fading light) shook itself, heaped itself, let all this encumbrance of houses, castles, and woods slide off its tent-shaped sides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2938,2938,The bare mountains of Turkey were before her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2939,2939,It was blazing noon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2940,2940,She looked straight at the baked hill-side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2941,2941,Goats cropped the sandy tufts at her feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2942,2942,An eagle soared above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2943,2943,"The raucous voice of old Rustum, the gipsy, croaked in her ears, 'What is your antiquity and your race, and your possessions compared with this? What do you need with four hundred bedrooms and silver lids on all your dishes, and housemaids dusting?'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2944,2944,At this moment some church clock chimed in the valley.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2945,2945,The tent-like landscape collapsed and fell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2946,2946,"The present showered down upon her head once more, but now that the light was fading, gentlier than before, calling into view nothing detailed, nothing small, but only misty fields, cottages with lamps in them, the slumbering bulk of a wood, and a fan-shaped light pushing the darkness before it along some lane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2947,2947,"Whether it had struck nine, ten, or eleven, she could not say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2948,2948,"Night had come--night that she loved of all times, night in which the reflections in the dark pool of the mind shine more clearly than by day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2949,2949,"It was not necessary to faint now in order to look deep into the darkness where things shape themselves and to see in the pool of the mind now Shakespeare, now a girl in Russian trousers, now a toy boat on the Serpentine, and then the Atlantic itself, where it storms in great waves past Cape Horn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2950,2950,She looked into the darkness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2951,2951,"There was her husband's brig, rising to the top of the wave!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2952,2952,"Up, it went, and up and up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2953,2953,The white arch of a thousand deaths rose before it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2954,2954,"Oh rash, oh ridiculous man, always sailing, so uselessly, round Cape Horn in the teeth of a gale!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2955,2955,But the brig was through the arch and out on the other side; it was safe at last!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2956,2956,"'Ecstasy!' she cried, 'ecstasy!'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2957,2957,"And then the wind sank, the waters grew calm; and she saw the waves rippling peacefully in the moonlight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2958,2958,"'Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine!' she cried, standing by the oak tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2959,2959,"The beautiful, glittering name fell out of the sky like a steel-blue feather.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2960,2960,"She watched it fall, turning and twisting like a slow-falling arrow that cleaves the deep air beautifully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2961,2961,"He was coming, as he always came, in moments of dead calm; when the wave rippled and the spotted leaves fell slowly over her foot in the autumn woods; when the leopard was still; the moon was on the waters, and nothing moved in between sky and sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2962,2962,Then he came.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2963,2963,All was still now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2964,2964,It was near midnight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2965,2965,The moon rose slowly over the weald.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2966,2966,Its light raised a phantom castle upon earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2967,2967,There stood the great house with all its windows robed in silver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2968,2968,Of wall or substance there was none.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2969,2969,All was phantom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2970,2970,All was still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2971,2971,All was lit as for the coming of a dead Queen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2972,2972,"Gazing below her, Orlando saw dark plumes tossing in the courtyard, and torches flickering and shadows kneeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2973,2973,A Queen once more stepped from her chariot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2974,2974,"'The house is at your service, Ma'am,' she cried, curtseying deeply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2975,2975,"'Nothing has been changed. The dead Lord, my father, shall lead you in.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2976,2976,"As she spoke, the first stroke of midnight sounded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2977,2977,The cold breeze of the present brushed her face with its little breath of fear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2978,2978,She looked anxiously into the sky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2979,2979,It was dark with clouds now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2980,2980,The wind roared in her ears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2981,2981,But in the roar of the wind she heard the roar of an aeroplane coming nearer and nearer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2982,2982,'Here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2983,2983,"Shel, here!' she cried, baring her breast to the moon (which now showed bright) so that her pearls glowed--like the eggs of some vast moon-spider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2984,2984,The aeroplane rushed out of the clouds and stood over her head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2985,2985,It hovered above her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2986,2986,Her pearls burnt like a phosphorescent flare in the darkness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2987,2987,"And as Shelmerdine, now grown a fine sea captain, hale, fresh-coloured, and alert, leapt to the ground, there sprang up over his head a single wild bird.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2988,2988,'It is the goose!',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2989,2989,Orlando cried.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2990,2990,'The wild goose...',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2991,2991,"And the twelfth stroke of midnight sounded; the twelfth stroke of midnight, Thursday, the eleventh of October, Nineteen hundred and Twenty Eight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
