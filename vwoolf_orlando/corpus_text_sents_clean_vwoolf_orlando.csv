0,he  for there could be no doubt of his sex  though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it  was in the act of slicing at the head of a moor which swung from the rafters 
1,it was the colour of an old football  and more or less the shape of one  save for the sunken cheeks and a strand or two of coarse  dry hair  like the hair on a cocoanut 
2,orlando own father  or perhaps his grandfather  had struck it from the shoulders of a vast pagan who had started up under the moon in the barbarian fields of africa  and now it swung  gently  perpetually  in the breeze which never ceased blowing through the attic rooms of the gigantic house of the lord who had slain him 
3,orlando own fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel  and stony fields  and fields watered by strange rivers  and they had struck many heads of many colours off many shoulders  and brought them back to hang from the rafters 
4,so too would orlando  he vowed 
5,but since he was sixteen only  and too young to ride with them in africa or france  he would steal away from his mother and the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade 
6,sometimes he cut the cord so that the skull bumped on the floor and he had to string it up again  fastening it with some chivalry almost out of reach so that his enemy grinned at him through shrunk  black lips triumphantly 
7,the skull swung to and fro  for the house  at the top of which he lived  was so vast that there seemed trapped in it the wind itself  blowing this way  blowing that way  winter and summer 
8,the green arras with the hunters on it moved perpetually 
9,his fathers had been noble since they had been at all 
10,they came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads 
11,were not the bars of darkness in the room  and the yellow pools which chequered the floor  made by the sun falling through the stained glass of a vast coat of arms in the window 
12,orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of an heraldic leopard 
13,when he put his hand on the window sill to push the window open  it was instantly coloured red  blue  and yellow like a butterfly own wing 
14,thus  those who like symbols  and have a turn for the deciphering of them  might observe that though the shapely legs  the handsome body  and the well set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light  orlando own face  as he threw the window open  was lit solely by the sun itself 
15,a more candid  sullen face it would be impossible to find 
16,happy the mother who bears  happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one 
17,never need she vex herself  nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet 
18,from deed to deed  from glory to glory  from office to office he must go  his scribe following after  till they reach whatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire 
19,orlando  to look at  was cut out precisely for some such career 
20,the red of the cheeks was covered with peach down  the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks 
21,the lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness 
22,nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in its short  tense flight  the hair was dark  the ears small  and fitted closely to the head 
23,but  alas  that these catalogues of youthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes 
24,alas  that people are seldom born devoid of all three  for directly we glance at orlando standing by the window  we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets  so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them  and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were his temples 
25,directly we glance at eyes and forehead  thus do we rhapsodize 
26,directly we glance at eyes and forehead  we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore 
27,sights disturbed him  like that of his mother  a very beautiful lady in green walking out to feed the peacocks with twitchett  her maid  behind her  sights exalted him  the birds and the trees  and made him in love with death  the evening sky  the homing rooks  and so  mounting up the spiral stairway into his brain  which was a roomy one  all these sights  and the garden sounds too  the hammer beating  the wood chopping  began that riot and confusion of the passions and emotions which every good biographer detests  but to continue  orlando slowly drew in his head  sat down at the table  and  with the half conscious air of one doing what they do every day of their lives at this hour  took out a writing book labelled  aethelbert  a tragedy in five acts   and dipped an old stained goose quill in the ink 
28,soon he had covered ten pages and more with poetry 
29,he was fluent  evidently  but he was abstract 
30,vice  crime  misery were the personages of his drama  there were kings and queens of impossible territories  horrid plots confounded them  noble sentiments suffused them  there was never a word said as he himself would have said it  but all was turned with a fluency and sweetness which  considering his age  he was not yet seventeen  and that the sixteenth century had still some years of its course to run  were remarkable enough 
31,at last  however  he came to a halt 
32,he was describing  as all young poets are for ever describing  nature  and in order to match the shade of green precisely he looked  and here he showed more audacity than most  at the thing itself  which happened to be a laurel bush growing beneath the window 
33,after that  of course  he could write no more 
34,green in nature is one thing  green in literature another 
35,nature and letters seem to have a natural antipathy  bring them together and they tear each other to pieces 
36,the shade of green orlando now saw spoilt his rhyme and split his metre 
37,moreover  nature has tricks of her own 
38,once look out of a window at bees among flowers  at a yawning dog  at the sun setting  once think  how many more suns shall i see set   etc  etc   the thought is too well known to be worth writing out  and one drops the pen  takes one own cloak  strides out of the room  and catches one own foot on a painted chest as one does so 
39,for orlando was a trifle clumsy 
40,he was careful to avoid meeting anyone 
41,there was stubbs  the gardener  coming along the path 
42,he hid behind a tree till he had passed 
43,he let himself out at a little gate in the garden wall 
44,he skirted all stables  kennels  breweries  carpenters  shops  washhouses  places where they make tallow candles  kill oxen  forge horse shoes  stitch jerkins  for the house was a town ringing with men at work at their various crafts  and gained the ferny path leading uphill through the park unseen 
45,there is perhaps a kinship among qualities  one draws another along with it  and the biographer should here call attention to the fact that this clumsiness is often mated with a love of solitude 
46,having stumbled over a chest  orlando naturally loved solitary places  vast views  and to feel himself for ever and ever and ever alone 
47,so  after a long silence   i am alone   he breathed at last  opening his lips for the first time in this record 
48,he had walked very quickly uphill through ferns and hawthorn bushes  startling deer and wild birds  to a place crowned by a single oak tree 
49,it was very high  so high indeed that nineteen english counties could be seen beneath  and on clear days thirty or perhaps forty  if the weather was very fine 
50,sometimes one could see the english channel  wave reiterating upon wave 
51,rivers could be seen and pleasure boats gliding on them  and galleons setting out to sea  and armadas with puffs of smoke from which came the dull thud of cannon firing  and forts on the coast  and castles among the meadows  and here a watch tower  and there a fortress  and again some vast mansion like that of orlando own father  massed like a town in the valley circled by walls 
52,to the east there were the spires of london and the smoke of the city  and perhaps on the very sky line  when the wind was in the right quarter  the craggy top and serrated edges of snowdon herself showed mountainous among the clouds 
53,for a moment orlando stood counting  gazing  recognizing 
54,that was his father own house  that his uncle own 
55,his aunt owned those three great turrets among the trees there 
56,the heath was theirs and the forest  the pheasant and the deer  the fox  the badger  and the butterfly 
57,he sighed profoundly  and flung himself  there was a passion in his movements which deserves the word  on the earth at the foot of the oak tree 
58,he loved  beneath all this summer transiency  to feel the earth own spine beneath him  for such he took the hard root of the oak tree to be  or  for image followed image  it was the back of a great horse that he was riding  or the deck of a tumbling ship  it was anything indeed  so long as it was hard  for he felt the need of something which he could attach his floating heart to  the heart that tugged at his side  the heart that seemed filled with spiced and amorous gales every evening about this time when he walked out 
59,to the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there  gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself  the little leaves hung  the deer stopped  the pale summer clouds stayed  his limbs grew heavy on the ground  and he lay so still that by degrees the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past  as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer own evening were woven web like about his body 
60,after an hour or so  the sun was rapidly sinking  the white clouds had turned red  the hills were violet  the woods purple  the valleys black  a trumpet sounded 
61,orlando leapt to his feet 
62,the shrill sound came from the valley 
63,it came from a dark spot down there  a spot compact and mapped out  a maze  a town  yet girt about with walls  it came from the heart of his own great house in the valley  which  dark before  even as he looked and the single trumpet duplicated and reduplicated itself with other shriller sounds  lost its darkness and became pierced with lights 
64,some were small hurrying lights  as if servants dashed along corridors to answer summonses  others were high and lustrous lights  as if they burnt in empty banqueting halls made ready to receive guests who had not come  and others dipped and waved and sank and rose  as if held in the hands of troops of serving men  bending  kneeling  rising  receiving  guarding  and escorting with all dignity indoors a great princess alighting from her chariot 
65,coaches turned and wheeled in the courtyard 
66,horses tossed their plumes 
67,the queen had come 
68,orlando looked no more 
69,he dashed downhill 
70,he let himself in at a wicket gate 
71,he tore up the winding staircase 
72,he reached his room 
73,he tossed his stockings to one side of the room  his jerkin to the other 
74,he dipped his head 
75,he scoured his hands 
76,he pared his finger nails 
77,with no more than six inches of looking glass and a pair of old candles to help him  he had thrust on crimson breeches  lace collar  waistcoat of taffeta  and shoes with rosettes on them as big as double dahlias in less than ten minutes by the stable clock 
78,he was ready 
79,he was flushed 
80,he was excited  but he was terribly late 
81,by short cuts known to him  he made his way now through the vast congeries of rooms and staircases to the banqueting hall  five acres distant on the other side of the house 
82,but half way there  in the back quarters where the servants lived  he stopped 
83,the door of mrs stewkley own sitting room stood open  she was gone  doubtless  with all her keys to wait upon her mistress  but there  sitting at the servant own dinner table with a tankard beside him and paper in front of him  sat a rather fat  shabby man  whose ruff was a thought dirty  and whose clothes were of hodden brown  he held a pen in his hand  but he was not writing  he seemed in the act of rolling some thought up and down  to and fro in his mind till it gathered shape or momentum to his liking  his eyes  globed and clouded like some green stone of curious texture  were fixed  he did not see orlando  for all his hurry  orlando stopped dead  was this a poet  was he writing poetry   tell me   he wanted to say   everything in the whole world   for he had the wildest  most absurd  extravagant ideas about poets and poetry  but how speak to a man who does not see you 
84,who sees ogres  satyrs  perhaps the depths of the sea instead 
85,so orlando stood gazing while the man turned his pen in his fingers  this way and that way  and gazed and mused  and then  very quickly  wrote half a dozen lines and looked up 
86,whereupon orlando  overcome with shyness  darted off and reached the banqueting hall only just in time to sink upon his knees and  hanging his head in confusion  to offer a bowl of rose water to the great queen herself 
87,such was his shyness that he saw no more of her than her ringed hands in water  but it was enough 
88,it was a memorable hand  a thin hand with long fingers always curling as if round orb or sceptre  a nervous  crabbed  sickly hand  a commanding hand too  a hand that had only to raise itself for a head to fall  a hand  he guessed  attached to an old body that smelt like a cupboard in which furs are kept in camphor  which body was yet caparisoned in all sorts of brocades and gems  and held itself very upright though perhaps in pain from sciatica  and never flinched though strung together by a thousand fears  and the queen own eyes were light yellow 
89,all this he felt as the great rings flashed in the water and then something pressed his hair  which  perhaps  accounts for his seeing nothing more likely to be of use to a historian  and in truth  his mind was such a welter of opposites  of the night and the blazing candles  of the shabby poet and the great queen  of silent fields and the clatter of serving men  that he could see nothing  or only a hand 
90,by the same showing  the queen herself can have seen only a head 
91,but if it is possible from a hand to deduce a body  informed with all the attributes of a great queen  her crabbedness  courage  frailty  and terror  surely a head can be as fertile  looked down upon from a chair of state by a lady whose eyes were always  if the waxworks at the abbey are to be trusted  wide open 
92,the long  curled hair  the dark head bent so reverently  so innocently before her  implied a pair of the finest legs that a young nobleman has ever stood upright upon  and violet eyes  and a heart of gold  and loyalty and manly charm  all qualities which the old woman loved the more the more they failed her  for she was growing old and worn and bent before her time  the sound of cannon was always in her ears  she saw always the glistening poison drop and the long stiletto  as she sat at table she listened  she heard the guns in the channel  she dreaded  was that a curse  was that a whisper 
93,innocence  simplicity  were all the more dear to her for the dark background she set them against 
94,and it was that same night  so tradition has it  when orlando was sound asleep  that she made over formally  putting her hand and seal finally to the parchment  the gift of the great monastic house that had been the archbishop own and then the king own to orlando own father 
95,orlando slept all night in ignorance 
96,he had been kissed by a queen without knowing it 
97,and perhaps  for women own hearts are intricate  it was his ignorance and the start he gave when her lips touched him that kept the memory of her young cousin  for they had blood in common  green in her mind 
98,at any rate  two years of this quiet country life had not passed  and orlando had written no more perhaps than twenty tragedies and a dozen histories and a score of sonnets when a message came that he was to attend the queen at whitehall 
99, here   she said  watching him advance down the long gallery towards her   comes my innocent    there was a serenity about him always which had the look of innocence when  technically  the word was no longer applicable  
100, come   she said 
101,she was sitting bolt upright beside the fire 
102,and she held him a foot own pace from her and looked him up and down 
103,was she matching her speculations the other night with the truth now visible 
104,did she find her guesses justified 
105,eyes  mouth  nose  breast  hips  hands  she ran them over  her lips twitched visibly as she looked  but when she saw his legs she laughed out loud  he was the very image of a noble gentleman  but inwardly  she flashed her yellow hawk own eyes upon him as if she would pierce his soul  the young man withstood her gaze blushing only a damask rose as became him  strength  grace  romance  folly  poetry  youth  she read him like a page 
106,instantly she plucked a ring from her finger  the joint was swollen rather  and as she fitted it to his  named him her treasurer and steward  next hung about him chains of office  and bidding him bend his knee  tied round it at the slenderest part the jewelled order of the garter 
107,nothing after that was denied him 
108,when she drove in state he rode at her carriage door 
109,she sent him to scotland on a sad embassy to the unhappy queen 
110,he was about to sail for the polish wars when she recalled him 
111,for how could she bear to think of that tender flesh torn and that curly head rolled in the dust 
112,she kept him with her 
113,at the height of her triumph when the guns were booming at the tower and the air was thick enough with gunpowder to make one sneeze and the huzzas of the people rang beneath the windows  she pulled him down among the cushions where her women had laid her  she was so worn and old  and made him bury his face in that astonishing composition  she had not changed her dress for a month  which smelt for all the world  he thought  recalling his boyish memory  like some old cabinet at home where his mother own furs were stored 
114,he rose  half suffocated from the embrace 
115, this   she breathed   is my victory    even as a rocket roared up and dyed her cheeks scarlet 
116,for the old woman loved him 
117,and the queen  who knew a man when she saw one  though not  it is said  in the usual way  plotted for him a splendid ambitious career 
118,lands were given him  houses assigned him 
119,he was to be the son of her old age  the limb of her infirmity  the oak tree on which she leant her degradation 
120,she croaked out these promises and strange domineering tendernesses  they were at richmond now  sitting bolt upright in her stiff brocades by the fire which  however high they piled it  never kept her warm 
121,meanwhile  the long winter months drew on 
122,every tree in the park was lined with frost 
123,the river ran sluggishly 
124,one day when the snow was on the ground and the dark panelled rooms were full of shadows and the stags were barking in the park  she saw in the mirror  which she kept for fear of spies always by her  through the door  which she kept for fear of murderers always open  a boy  could it be orlando   kissing a girl  who in the devil own name was the brazen hussy 
125,snatching at her golden hilted sword she struck violently at the mirror 
126,the glass crashed  people came running  she was lifted and set in her chair again  but she was stricken after that and groaned much  as her days wore to an end  of man own treachery 
127,it was orlando own fault perhaps  yet  after all  are we to blame orlando 
128,the age was the elizabethan  their morals were not ours  nor their poets  nor their climate  nor their vegetables even 
129,everything was different 
130,the weather itself  the heat and cold of summer and winter  was  we may believe  of another temper altogether 
131,the brilliant amorous day was divided as sheerly from the night as land from water 
132,sunsets were redder and more intense  dawns were whiter and more auroral 
133,of our crepuscular half lights and lingering twilights they knew nothing 
134,the rain fell vehemently  or not at all 
135,the sun blazed or there was darkness 
136,translating this to the spiritual regions as their will not is  the poets sang beautifully how roses fade and petals fall 
137,the moment is brief they sang  the moment is over  one long night is then to be slept by all 
138,as for using the artifices of the greenhouse or conservatory to prolong or preserve these fresh pinks and roses  that was not their way 
139,the withered intricacies and ambiguities of our more gradual and doubtful age were unknown to them 
140,violence was all 
141,the flower bloomed and faded 
142,the sun rose and sank 
143,the lover loved and went 
144,and what the poets said in rhyme  the young translated into practice 
145,girls were roses  and their seasons were short as the flowers  
146,plucked they must be before nightfall  for the day was brief and the day was all 
147,thus  if orlando followed the leading of the climate  of the poets  of the age itself  and plucked his flower in the window seat even with the snow on the ground and the queen vigilant in the corridor we can scarcely bring ourselves to blame him 
148,he was young  he was boyish  he did but as nature bade him do 
149,as for the girl  we know no more than queen elizabeth herself did what her name was 
150,it may have been doris  chloris  delia  or diana  for he made rhymes to them all in turn  equally  she may have been a court lady  or some serving maid 
151,for orlando own taste was broad  he was no lover of garden flowers only  the wild and the weeds even had always a fascination for him 
152,here  indeed  we lay bare rudely  as a biographer may  a curious trait in him  to be accounted for  perhaps  by the fact that a certain grandmother of his had worn a smock and carried milkpails 
153,some grains of the kentish or sussex earth were mixed with the thin  fine fluid which came to him from normandy 
154,he held that the mixture of brown earth and blue blood was a good one 
155,certain it is that he had always a liking for low company  especially for that of lettered people whose wits so often keep them under  as if there were the sympathy of blood between them 
156,at this season of his life  when his head brimmed with rhymes and he never went to bed without striking off some conceit  the cheek of an innkeeper own daughter seemed fresher and the wit of a gamekeeper own niece seemed quicker than those of the ladies at court 
157,hence  he began going frequently to wapping old stairs and the beer gardens at night  wrapped in a grey cloak to hide the star at his neck and the garter at his knee 
158,there  with a mug before him  among the sanded alleys and bowling greens and all the simple architecture of such places  he listened to sailors  stories of hardship and horror and cruelty on the spanish main  how some had lost their toes  others their noses  for the spoken story was never so rounded or so finely coloured as the written 
159,especially he loved to hear them volley forth their songs of  the azores  while the parrakeets  which they had brought from those parts  pecked at the rings in their ears  tapped with their hard acquisitive beaks at the rubies on their fingers  and swore as vilely as their masters 
160,the women were scarcely less bold in their speech and less free in their manner than the birds 
161,they perched on his knee  flung their arms round his neck and  guessing that something out of the common lay hid beneath his duffle cloak  were quite as eager to come at the truth of the matter as orlando himself 
162,nor was opportunity lacking 
163,the river was astir early and late with barges  wherries  and craft of all description 
164,every day sailed to sea some fine ship bound for the indies  now and again another blackened and ragged with hairy men on board crept painfully to anchor 
165,no one missed a boy or girl if they dallied a little on the water after sunset  or raised an eyebrow if gossip had seen them sleeping soundly among the treasure sacks safe in each other own arms 
166,such indeed was the adventure that befel orlando  sukey  and the earl of cumberland 
167,the day was hot  their loves had been active  they had fallen asleep among the rubies 
168,late that night the earl  whose fortunes were much bound up in the spanish ventures  came to check the booty alone with a lantern 
169,he flashed the light on a barrel 
170,he started back with an oath 
171,twined about the cask two spirits lay sleeping 
172,superstitious by nature  and his conscience laden with many a crime  the earl took the couple  they were wrapped in a red cloak  and sukey own bosom was almost as white as the eternal snows of orlando own poetry  for a phantom sprung from the graves of drowned sailors to upbraid him 
173,he crossed himself 
174,he vowed repentance 
175,the row of alms houses still standing in the sheen road is the visible fruit of that moment own panic 
176,twelve poor old women of the parish today drink tea and tonight bless his lordship for a roof above their heads  so that illicit love in a treasure ship  but we omit the moral 
177,soon  however  orlando grew tired  not only of the discomfort of this way of life  and of the crabbed streets of the neighbourhood  but of the primitive manner of the people 
178,for it has to be remembered that crime and poverty had none of the attraction for the elizabethans that they have for us 
179,they had none of our modern shame of book learning  none of our belief that to be born the son of a butcher is a blessing and to be unable to read a virtue  no fancy that what we call  life  and  reality  are somehow connected with ignorance and brutality  nor  indeed  any equivalent for these two words at all 
180,it was not to seek  life  that orlando went among them  not in quest of  reality  that he left them 
181,but when he had heard a score of times how jakes had lost his nose and sukey her honour  and they told the stories admirably  it must be admitted  he began to be a little weary of the repetition  for a nose can only be cut off in one way and maidenhood lost in another  or so it seemed to him  whereas the arts and the sciences had a diversity about them which stirred his curiosity profoundly 
182,so  always keeping them in happy memory  he left off frequenting the beer gardens and the skittle alleys  hung his grey cloak in his wardrobe  let his star shine at his neck and his garter twinkle at his knee  and appeared once more at the court of king james 
183,he was young  he was rich  he was handsome 
184,no one could have been received with greater acclamation than he was 
185,it is certain indeed that many ladies were ready to show him their favours 
186,the names of three at least were freely coupled with his in marriage  clorinda  favilla  euphrosyne  so he called them in his sonnets 
187,to take them in order  clorinda was a sweet mannered gentle lady enough   indeed orlando was greatly taken with her for six months and a half  but she had white eyelashes and could not bear the sight of blood 
188,a hare brought up roasted at her father own table turned her faint 
189,she was much under the influence of the priests too  and stinted her underlinen in order to give to the poor 
190,she took it on her to reform orlando of his sins  which sickened him  so that he drew back from the marriage  and did not much regret it when she died soon after of the small pox 
191,favilla  who comes next  was of a different sort altogether 
192,she was the daughter of a poor somersetshire gentleman  who  by sheer assiduity and the use of her eyes had worked her way up at court  where her address in horsemanship  her fine instep  and her grace in dancing won the admiration of all 
193,once  however  she was so ill advised as to whip a spaniel that had torn one of her silk stockings  and it must be said in justice that favilla had few stockings and those for the most part of drugget  within an inch of its life beneath orlando own window 
194,orlando  who was a passionate lover of animals  now noticed that her teeth were crooked  and the two front turned inward  which  he said  is a sure sign of a perverse and cruel disposition in women  and so broke the engagement that very night for ever 
195,the third  euphrosyne  was by far the most serious of his flames 
196,she was by birth one of the irish desmonds and had therefore a family tree of her own as old and deeply rooted as orlando own itself 
197,she was fair  florid  and a trifle phlegmatic 
198,she spoke italian well  had a perfect set of teeth in the upper jaw  though those on the lower were slightly discoloured 
199,she was never without a whippet or spaniel at her knee  fed them with white bread from her own plate  sang sweetly to the virginals  and was never dressed before mid day owing to the extreme care she took of her person 
200,in short  she would have made a perfect wife for such a nobleman as orlando  and matters had gone so far that the lawyers on both sides were busy with covenants  jointures  settlements  messuages  tenements  and whatever is needed before one great fortune can mate with another when  with the suddenness and severity that then marked the english climate  came the great frost 
201,the great frost was  historians tell us  the most severe that has ever visited these islands 
202,birds froze in mid air and fell like stones to the ground 
203,at norwich a young countrywoman started to cross the road in her usual robust health and was seen by the onlookers to turn visibly to powder and be blown in a puff of dust over the roofs as the icy blast struck her at the street corner 
204,the mortality among sheep and cattle was enormous 
205,corpses froze and could not be drawn from the sheets 
206,it was no uncommon sight to come upon a whole herd of swine frozen immovable upon the road 
207,the fields were full of shepherds  ploughmen  teams of horses  and little bird scaring boys all struck stark in the act of the moment  one with his hand to his nose  another with the bottle to his lips  a third with a stone raised to throw at the ravens who sat  as if stuffed  upon the hedge within a yard of him 
208,the severity of the frost was so extraordinary that a kind of petrifaction sometimes ensued  and it was commonly supposed that the great increase of rocks in some parts of derbyshire was due to no eruption  for there was none  but to the solidification of unfortunate wayfarers who had been turned literally to stone where they stood 
209,the church could give little help in the matter  and though some landowners had these relics blessed  the most part preferred to use them either as landmarks  scratching posts for sheep  or  when the form of the stone allowed  drinking troughs for cattle  which purposes they serve  admirably for the most part  to this day 
210,but while the country people suffered the extremity of want  and the trade of the country was at a standstill  london enjoyed a carnival of the utmost brilliancy 
211,the court was at greenwich  and the new king seized the opportunity that his coronation gave him to curry favour with the citizens 
212,he directed that the river  which was frozen to a depth of twenty feet and more for six or seven miles on either side  should be swept  decorated and given all the semblance of a park or pleasure ground  with arbours  mazes  alleys  drinking booths  etc  at his expense 
213,for himself and the courtiers  he reserved a certain space immediately opposite the palace gates  which  railed off from the public only by a silken rope  became at once the centre of the most brilliant society in england 
214,great statesmen  in their beards and ruffs  despatched affairs of state under the crimson awning of the royal pagoda 
215,soldiers planned the conquest of the moor and the downfall of the turk in striped arbours surmounted by plumes of ostrich feathers 
216,admirals strode up and down the narrow pathways  glass in hand  sweeping the horizon and telling stories of the north west passage and the spanish armada 
217,lovers dallied upon divans spread with sables 
218,frozen roses fell in showers when the queen and her ladies walked abroad 
219,coloured balloons hovered motionless in the air 
220,here and there burnt vast bonfires of cedar and oak wood  lavishly salted  so that the flames were of green  orange  and purple fire 
221,but however fiercely they burnt  the heat was not enough to melt the ice which  though of singular transparency  was yet of the hardness of steel 
222,so clear indeed was it that there could be seen  congealed at a depth of several feet  here a porpoise  there a flounder 
223,shoals of eels lay motionless in a trance  but whether their state was one of death or merely of suspended animation which the warmth would revive puzzled the philosophers 
224,near london bridge  where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty fathoms  a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible  lying on the bed of the river where it had sunk last autumn  overladen with apples 
225,the old bumboat woman  who was carrying her fruit to market on the surrey side  sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap full of apples  for all the world as if she were about to serve a customer  though a certain blueness about the lips hinted the truth 
226,it was a sight king james specially liked to look upon  and he would bring a troupe of courtiers to gaze with him 
227,in short  nothing could exceed the brilliancy and gaiety of the scene by day 
228,but it was at night that the carnival was at its merriest 
229,for the frost continued unbroken  the nights were of perfect stillness  the moon and stars blazed with the hard fixity of diamonds  and to the fine music of flute and trumpet the courtiers danced 
230,orlando  it is true  was none of those who tread lightly the corantoe and lavolta  he was clumsy and a little absentminded 
231,he much preferred the plain dances of his own country  which he danced as a child to these fantastic foreign measures 
232,he had indeed just brought his feet together about six in the evening of the seventh of january at the finish of some such quadrille or minuet when he beheld  coming from the pavilion of the muscovite embassy  a figure  which  whether boy own or woman own  for the loose tunic and trousers of the russian fashion served to disguise the sex  filled him with the highest curiosity 
233,the person  whatever the name or sex  was about middle height  very slenderly fashioned  and dressed entirely in oyster coloured velvet  trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish coloured fur 
234,but these details were obscured by the extraordinary seductiveness which issued from the whole person 
235,images  metaphors of the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind 
236,he called her a melon  a pineapple  an olive tree  an emerald  and a fox in the snow all in the space of three seconds  he did not know whether he had heard her  tasted her  seen her  or all three together 
237, for though we must pause not a moment in the narrative we may here hastily note that all his images at this time were simple in the extreme to match his senses and were mostly taken from things he had liked the taste of as a boy  but if his senses were simple they were at the same time extremely strong  to pause therefore and seek the reasons of things is out of the question     a melon  an emerald  a fox in the snow  so he raved  so he stared  when the boy  for alas  a boy it must be  no woman could skate with such speed and vigour  swept almost on tiptoe past him  orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that the person was of his own sex  and thus all embraces were out of the question 
238,but the skater came closer 
239,legs  hands  carriage  were a boy own  but no boy ever had a mouth like that  no boy had those breasts  no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from the bottom of the sea 
240,finally  coming to a stop and sweeping a curtsey with the utmost grace to the king  who was shuffling past on the arm of some lord in waiting  the unknown skater came to a standstill 
241,she was not a handsbreadth off 
242,she was a woman 
243,orlando stared  trembled  turned hot  turned cold  longed to hurl himself through the summer air  to crush acorns beneath his feet  to toss his arm with the beech trees and the oaks 
244,as it was  he drew his lips up over his small white teeth  opened them perhaps half an inch as if to bite  shut them as if he had bitten 
245,the lady euphrosyne hung upon his arm 
246,the stranger own name  he found  was the princess marousha stanilovska dagmar natasha iliana romanovitch  and she had come in the train of the muscovite ambassador  who was her uncle perhaps  or perhaps her father  to attend the coronation 
247,very little was known of the muscovites 
248,in their great beards and furred hats they sat almost silent  drinking some black liquid which they spat out now and then upon the ice 
249,none spoke english  and french with which some at least were familiar was then little spoken at the english court 
250,it was through this accident that orlando and the princess became acquainted 
251,they were seated opposite each other at the great table spread under a huge awning for the entertainment of the notables 
252,the princess was placed between two young lords  one lord francis vere and the other the young earl of moray 
253,it was laughable to see the predicament she soon had them in  for though both were fine lads in their way  the babe unborn had as much knowledge of the french tongue as they had 
254,when at the beginning of dinner the princess turned to the earl and said  with a grace which ravished his heart   je crois avoir fait la connaissance d un gentilhomme qui vous etait apparente en pologne l ete dernier   or  la beaute des dames de la cour d angleterre me met dans le ravissement  on ne peut voir une dame plus gracieuse que votre reine  ni une coiffure plus belle que la sienne   both lord francis and the earl showed the highest embarrassment 
255,the one helped her largely to horse radish sauce  the other whistled to his dog and made him beg for a marrow bone 
256,at this the princess could no longer contain her laughter  and orlando  catching her eyes across the boars  heads and stuffed peacocks  laughed too 
257,he laughed  but the laugh on his lips froze in wonder 
258,whom had he loved  what had he loved  he asked himself in a tumult of emotion  until now 
259,an old woman  he answered  all skin and bone 
260,red cheeked trulls too many to mention 
261,a puling nun 
262,a hard bitten cruel mouthed adventuress 
263,a nodding mass of lace and ceremony 
264,love had meant to him nothing but sawdust and cinders 
265,the joys he had had of it tasted insipid in the extreme 
266,he marvelled how he could have gone through with it without yawning 
267,for as he looked the thickness of his blood melted  the ice turned to wine in his veins  he heard the waters flowing and the birds singing  spring broke over the hard wintry landscape  his manhood woke  he grasped a sword in his hand  he charged a more daring foe than pole or moor  he dived in deep water  he saw the flower of danger growing in a crevice  he stretched his hand  in fact he was rattling off one of his most impassioned sonnets when the princess addressed him   would you have the goodness to pass the salt  
268,he blushed deeply 
269, with all the pleasure in the world  madame   he replied  speaking french with a perfect accent 
270,for  heaven be praised  he spoke the tongue as his own  his mother own maid had taught him 
271,yet perhaps it would have been better for him had he never learnt that tongue  never answered that voice  never followed the light of those eyes   
272,the princess continued 
273,who were those bumpkins  she asked him  who sat beside her with the manners of stablemen 
274,what was the nauseating mixture they had poured on her plate 
275,did the dogs eat at the same table with the men in england 
276,was that figure of fun at the end of the table with her hair rigged up like a maypole  comme une grande perche mal fagotee  really the queen 
277,and did the king always slobber like that 
278,and which of those popinjays was george villiers 
279,though these questions rather discomposed orlando at first  they were put with such archness and drollery that he could not help but laugh  and he saw from the blank faces of the company that nobody understood a word  he answered her as freely as she asked him  speaking  as she did  in perfect french 
280,thus began an intimacy between the two which soon became the scandal of the court 
281,soon it was observed orlando paid the muscovite far more attention than mere civility demanded 
282,he was seldom far from her side  and their conversation  though unintelligible to the rest  was carried on with such animation  provoked such blushes and laughter  that the dullest could guess the subject 
283,moreover  the change in orlando himself was extraordinary 
284,nobody had ever seen him so animated 
285,in one night he had thrown off his boyish clumsiness  he was changed from a sulky stripling  who could not enter a ladies  room without sweeping half the ornaments from the table  to a nobleman  full of grace and manly courtesy 
286,to see him hand the muscovite  as she was called  to her sledge  or offer her his hand for the dance  or catch the spotted kerchief which she had let drop  or discharge any other of those manifold duties which the supreme lady exacts and the lover hastens to anticipate was a sight to kindle the dull eyes of age  and to make the quick pulse of youth beat faster 
287,yet over it all hung a cloud 
288,the old men shrugged their shoulders 
289,the young tittered between their fingers 
290,all knew that a orlando was betrothed to another 
291,the lady margaret o brien o dare o reilly tyrconnel  for that was the proper name of euphrosyne of the sonnets  wore orlando own splendid sapphire on the second finger of her left hand 
292,it was she who had the supreme right to his attentions 
293,yet she might drop all the handkerchiefs in her wardrobe  of which she had many scores  upon the ice and orlando never stooped to pick them up 
294,she might wait twenty minutes for him to hand her to her sledge  and in the end have to be content with the services of her blackamoor 
295,when she skated  which she did rather clumsily  no one was at her elbow to encourage her  and  if she fell  which she did rather heavily  no one raised her to her feet and dusted the snow from her petticoats 
296,although she was naturally phlegmatic  slow to take offence  and more reluctant than most people to believe that a mere foreigner could oust her from orlando own affections  still even the lady margaret herself was brought at last to suspect that something was brewing against her peace of mind 
297,indeed  as the days passed  orlando took less and less care to hide his feelings 
298,making some excuse or other  he would leave the company as soon as they had dined  or steal away from the skaters  who were forming sets for a quadrille 
299,next moment it would be seen that the muscovite was missing too 
300,but what most outraged the court  and stung it in its tenderest part  which is its vanity  was that the couple was often seen to slip under the silken rope  which railed off the royal enclosure from the public part of the river and to disappear among the crowd of common people 
301,for suddenly the princess would stamp her foot and cry   take me away  i detest your english mob   by which she meant the english court itself 
302,she could stand it no longer 
303,it was full of prying old women  she said  who stared in one own face  and of bumptious young men who trod on one own toes 
304,they smelt bad 
305,their dogs ran between her legs 
306,it was like being in a cage 
307,in russia they had rivers ten miles broad on which one could gallop six horses abreast all day long without meeting a soul 
308,besides  she wanted to see the tower  the beefeaters  the heads on temple bar  and the jewellers  shops in the city 
309,thus  it came about that orlando took her into the city  showed her the beefeaters and the rebels  heads  and bought her whatever took her fancy in the royal exchange 
310,but this was not enough 
311,each increasingly desired the other own company in privacy all day long where there were none to marvel or to stare 
312,instead of taking the road to london  therefore  they turned the other way about and were soon beyond the crowd among the frozen reaches of the thames where  save for sea birds and some old country woman hacking at the ice in a vain attempt to draw a pailful of water or gathering what sticks or dead leaves she could find for firing  not a living soul ever came their way 
313,the poor kept closely to their cottages  and the better sort  who could afford it  crowded for warmth and merriment to the city 
314,hence  orlando and sasha  as he called her for short  and because it was the name of a white russian fox he had had as a boy  a creature soft as snow  but with teeth of steel  which bit him so savagely that his father had it killed  hence  they had the river to themselves 
315,hot with skating and with love they would throw themselves down in some solitary reach  where the yellow osiers fringed the bank  and wrapped in a great fur cloak orlando would take her in his arms  and know  for the first time  he murmured  the delights of love 
316,then  when the ecstasy was over and they lay lulled in a swoon on the ice  he would tell her of his other loves  and how  compared with her  they had been of wood  of sackcloth  and of cinders 
317,and laughing at his vehemence  she would turn once more in his arms and give him for love own sake  one more embrace 
318,and then they would marvel that the ice did not melt with their heat  and pity the poor old woman who had no such natural means of thawing it  but must hack at it with a chopper of cold steel 
319,and then  wrapped in their sables  they would talk of everything under the sun  of sights and travels  of moor and pagan  of this man own beard and that woman own skin  of a rat that fed from her hand at table  of the arras that moved always in the hall at home  of a face  of a feather 
320,nothing was too small for such converse  nothing was too great 
321,then suddenly  orlando would fall into one of his moods of melancholy  the sight of the old woman hobbling over the ice might be the because of it  or nothing  and would fling himself face downwards on the ice and look into the frozen waters and think of death 
322,for the philosopher is right who says that nothing thicker than a knife own blade separates happiness from melancholy  and he goes on to opine that one is twin fellow to the other  and draws from this the conclusion that all extremes of feeling are allied to madness  and so bids us take refuge in the true church  in his view the anabaptist   which is the only harbour  port  anchorage  etc   he said  for those tossed on this sea 
323, ends in death   orlando would say  sitting upright  his face clouded with gloom 
324, for that was the way his mind worked now  in violent see saws from life to death  stopping at nothing in between  so that the biographer must not stop either  but must fly as fast as he can and so keep pace with the unthinking passionate foolish actions and sudden extravagant words in which  it is impossible to deny  orlando at this time of his life indulged  
325, ends in death   orlando would say  sitting upright on the ice 
326,but sasha who after all had no english blood in her but was from russia where the sunsets are longer  the dawns less sudden  and sentences often left unfinished from doubt as to how best to end them  sasha stared at him  perhaps sneered at him  for he must have seemed a child to her  and said nothing  but at length the ice grew cold beneath them  which she disliked  so pulling him to his feet again  she talked so enchantingly  so wittily  so wisely  but unfortunately always in french  which notoriously loses its flavour in translation  that he forgot the frozen waters or night coming or the old woman or whatever it was  and would try to tell her  plunging and splashing among a thousand images which had gone as stale as the women who inspired them  what she was like  snow  cream  marble  cherries  alabaster  golden wire  none of these  she was like a fox  or an olive tree  like the waves of the sea when you look down upon them from a height  like an emerald  like the sun on a green hill which is yet clouded  like nothing he had seen or known in england 
327,ransack the language as he might  words failed him 
328,he wanted another landscape  and another tongue 
329,english was too frank  too candid  too honeyed a speech for sasha 
330,for in all she said  however open she seemed and voluptuous  there was something hidden  in all she did  however daring  there was something concealed 
331,so the green flame seems hidden in the emerald  or the sun prisoned in a hill 
332,the clearness was only outward  within was a wandering flame 
333,it came  it went  she never shone with the steady beam of an englishwoman  here  however  remembering the lady margaret and her petticoats  orlando ran wild in his transports and swept her over the ice  faster  faster  vowing that he would chase the flame  dive for the gem  and so on and so on  the words coming on the pants of his breath with the passion of a poet whose poetry is half pressed out of him by pain 
334,but sasha was silent 
335,when orlando had done telling her that she was a fox  an olive tree  or a green hill top  and had given her the whole history of his family  how their house was one of the most ancient in britain  how they had come from rome with the caesars and had the right to walk down the corso  which is the chief street in rome  under a tasselled palanquin  which he said is a privilege reserved only for those of imperial blood  for there was an orgulous credulity about him which was pleasant enough   he would pause and ask her  where was her own house 
336,what was her father 
337,had she brothers 
338,why was she here alone with her uncle 
339,then  somehow  though she answered readily enough  an awkwardness would come between them 
340,he suspected at first that her rank was not as high as she would like  or that she was ashamed of the savage ways of her people  for he had heard that the women in muscovy wear beards and the men are covered with fur from the waist down  that both sexes are smeared with tallow to keep the cold out  tear meat with their fingers and live in huts where an english noble would scruple to keep his cattle  so that he forebore to press her 
341,but on reflection  he concluded that her silence could not be for that reason  she herself was entirely free from hair on the chin  she dressed in velvet and pearls  and her manners were certainly not those of a woman bred in a cattle she would 
342,what  then  did she hide from him 
343,the doubt underlying the tremendous force of his feelings was like a quicksand beneath a monument which shifts suddenly and makes the whole pile shake 
344,the agony would seize him suddenly 
345,then he would blaze out in such wrath that she did not know how to quiet him 
346,perhaps she did not want to quiet him  perhaps his rages pleased her and she provoked them purposely  such is the curious obliquity of the muscovitish temperament 
347,to continue the story  skating farther than their will not that day they reached that part of the river where the ships had anchored and been frozen in midstream 
348,among them was the ship of the muscovite embassy flying its double headed black eagle from the main mast  which was hung with many coloured icicles several yards in length 
349,sasha had left some of her clothing on board  and supposing the ship to be empty they climbed on deck and went in search of it 
350,remembering certain passages in his own past  orlando would not have marvelled had some good citizens sought this refuge before them  and so it turned out 
351,they had not ventured far when a fine young man started up from some business of his own behind a coil of rope and saying  apparently  for he spoke russian  that he was one of the crew and would help the princess to find what she wanted  lit a lump of candle and disappeared with her into the lower parts of the ship 
352,time went by  and orlando  wrapped in his own dreams  thought only of the pleasures of life  of his jewel  of her rarity  of means for making her irrevocably and indissolubly his own 
353,obstacles there were and hardships to overcome 
354,she was determined to live in russia  where there were frozen rivers and wild horses and men  she said  who gashed each other own throats open 
355,it is true that a landscape of pine and snow  habits of lust and slaughter  did not entice him 
356,nor was he anxious to cease his pleasant country ways of sport and tree planting  relinquish his office  ruin his career  shoot the reindeer instead of the rabbit  drink vodka instead of canary  and slip a knife up his sleeve  for what purpose  he knew not  still  all this and more than all this he would do for her sake  as for his marriage to the lady margaret  fixed though it was for this day sennight  the thing was so palpably absurd that he scarcely gave it a thought  her kinsmen would abuse him for deserting a great lady  his friends would deride him for ruining the finest career in the world for a cossack woman and a waste of snow  it weighed not a straw in the balance compared with sasha herself 
357,on the first dark night they would fly 
358,they would take ship to russia 
359,so he pondered  so he plotted as he walked up and down the deck 
360,he was recalled  turning westward  by the sight of the sun  slung like an orange on the cross of st paul own 
361,it was blood red and sinking rapidly 
362,it must be almost evening 
363,sasha had been gone this hour and more 
364,seized instantly with those dark forebodings which shadowed even his most confident thoughts of her  he plunged the way he had seen them go into the hold of the ship  and  after stumbling among chests and barrels in the darkness  was made aware by a faint glimmer in a corner that they were seated there 
365,for one second  he had a vision of them  saw sasha seated on the sailor own knee  saw her bend towards him  saw them embrace before the light was blotted out in a red cloud by his rage 
366,he blazed into such a howl of anguish that the whole ship echoed 
367,sasha threw herself between them  or the sailor would have been stifled before he could draw his cutlass 
368,then a deadly sickness came over orlando  and they had to lay him on the floor and give him brandy to drink before he revived 
369,and then  when he had recovered and was sat upon a heap of sacking on deck  sasha hung over him  passing before his dizzied eyes softly  sinuously  like the fox that had bit him  now cajoling  now denouncing  so that he came to doubt what he had seen 
370,had not the candle guttered  had not the shadows moved 
371,the box was heavy  she said  the man was helping her to move it 
372,orlando believed her one moment  for who can be sure that his rage has not painted what he most dreads to find   the next was the more violent with anger at her deceit 
373,then sasha herself turned white  stamped her foot on deck  said she would go that night  and called upon her gods to destroy her  if she  a romanovitch  had lain in the arms of a common seaman 
374,indeed  looking at them together  which he could hardly bring himself to do  orlando was outraged by the foulness of his imagination that could have painted so frail a creature in the paw of that hairy sea brute 
375,the man was huge  stood six feet four in his stockings  wore common wire rings in his ears  and looked like a dray horse upon which some wren or robin has perched in its flight 
376,so he yielded  believed her  and asked her pardon 
377,yet when they were going down the ship own side  lovingly again  sasha paused with her hand on the ladder  and called back to this tawny wide cheeked monster a volley of russian greetings  jests  or endearments  not a word of which orlando could understand 
378,but there was something in her tone  it might be the fault of the russian consonants  that reminded orlando of a scene some nights since  when he had come upon her in secret gnawing a candle end in a corner  which she had picked from the floor 
379,true  it was pink  it was gilt  and it was from the king own table  but it was tallow  and she gnawed it 
380,was there not  he thought  handing her on to the ice  something rank in her  something coarse flavoured  something peasant born 
381,and he fancied her at forty grown unwieldy though she was now slim as a reed  and lethargic though she was now blithe as a lark 
382,but again as they skated towards london such suspicions melted in his breast  and he felt as if he had been hooked by a great fish through the nose and rushed through the waters unwillingly  yet with his own consent 
383,it was an evening of astonishing beauty 
384,as the sun sank  all the domes  spires  turrets  and pinnacles of london rose in inky blackness against the furious red sunset clouds 
385,here was the fretted cross at charing  there the dome of st paul own  there the massy square of the tower buildings  there like a grove of trees stripped of all leaves save a knob at the end were the heads on the pikes at temple bar 
386,now the abbey windows were lit up and burnt like a heavenly  many coloured shield  in orlando own fancy   now all the west seemed a golden window with troops of angels  in orlando own fancy again  passing up and down the heavenly stairs perpetually 
387,all the time they seemed to be skating in fathomless depths of air  so blue the ice had become  and so glassy smooth was it that they sped quicker and quicker to the city with the white gulls circling about them  and cutting in the air with their wings the very same sweeps that they cut on the ice with their skates 
388,sasha  as if to reassure him  was tenderer than usual and even more delightful 
389,seldom would she talk about her past life  but now she told him how  in winter in russia  she would listen to the wolves howling across the steppes  and thrice  to show him  she barked like a wolf 
390,upon which he told her of the stags in the snow at home  and how they would stray into the great hall for warmth and be fed by an old man with porridge from a bucket 
391,and then she praised him  for his love of beasts  for his gallantry  for his legs 
392,ravished with her praises and shamed to think how he had maligned her by fancying her on the knees of a common sailor and grown fat and lethargic at forty  he told her that he could find no words to praise her  yet instantly bethought him how she was like the spring and green grass and rushing waters  and seizing her more tightly than ever  he swung her with him half across the river so that the gulls and the cormorants swung too 
393,and halting at length  out of breath  she said  panting slightly  that he was like a million candled christmas tree  such as they have in russia  hung with yellow globes  incandescent  enough to light a whole street by   so one might translate it  for what with his glowing cheeks  his dark curls  his black and crimson cloak  he looked as if he were burning with his own radiance  from a lamp lit within 
394,all the colour  save the red of orlando own cheeks  soon faded 
395,night came on 
396,as the orange light of sunset vanished it was succeeded by an astonishing white glare from the torches  bonfires  flaming cressets  and other devices by which the river was lit up and the strangest transformation took place 
397,various churches and noblemen own palaces  whose fronts were of white stone showed in streaks and patches as if floating on the air 
398,of st paul own  in particular  nothing was left but a gilt cross 
399,the abbey appeared like the grey skeleton of a leaf 
400,everything suffered emaciation and transformation 
401,as they approached the carnival  they heard a deep note like that struck on a tuning fork which boomed louder and louder until it became an uproar 
402,every now and then a great shout followed a rocket into the air 
403,gradually they could discern little figures breaking off from the vast crowd and spinning hither and thither like gnats on the surface of a river 
404,above and around this brilliant circle like a bowl of darkness pressed the deep black of a winter own night 
405,and then into this darkness there began to rise with pauses  which kept the expectation alert and the mouth open  flowering rockets  crescents  serpents  a crown 
406,at one moment the woods and distant hills showed green as on a summer own day  the next all was winter and blackness again 
407,by this time orlando and the princess were close to the royal enclosure and found their way barred by a great crowd of the common people  who were pressing as near to the silken rope as they dared 
408,loth to end their privacy and encounter the sharp eyes that were on the watch for them  the couple lingered there  shouldered by apprentices  tailors  fishwives  horse dealers  cony catchers  starving scholars  maid servants in their whimples  orange girls  ostlers  sober citizens  bawdy tapsters  and a crowd of little ragamuffins such as always haunt the outskirts of a crowd  screaming and scrambling among people own feet  all the riff raff of the london streets indeed was there  jesting and jostling  here casting dice  telling fortunes  shoving  tickling  pinching  here uproarious  there glum  some of them with mouths gaping a yard wide  others as little reverent as daws on a house top  all as variously rigged out as their purse or stations allowed  here in fur and broadcloth  there in tatters with their feet kept from the ice only by a dishclout bound about them 
409,the main press of people  it appeared  stood opposite a booth or stage something like our punch and judy show upon which some kind of theatrical performance was going forward 
410,a black man was waving his arms and vociferating 
411,there was a woman in white laid upon a bed 
412,rough though the staging was  the actors running up and down a pair of steps and sometimes tripping  and the crowd stamping their feet and whistling  or when they were bored  tossing a piece of orange peel on to the ice which a dog would scramble for  still the astonishing  sinuous melody of the words stirred orlando like music 
413,spoken with extreme speed and a daring agility of tongue which reminded him of the sailors singing in the beer gardens at wapping  the words even without meaning were as wine to him 
414,but now and again a single phrase would come to him over the ice which was as if torn from the depths of his heart 
415,the frenzy of the moor seemed to him his own frenzy  and when the moor suffocated the woman in her bed it was sasha he killed with his own hands 
416,at last the play was ended 
417,all had grown dark 
418,the tears streamed down his face 
419,looking up into the sky there was nothing but blackness there too 
420,ruin and death  he thought  cover all 
421,the life of man ends in the grave 
422,worms devour us 
423,methinks it should be now a huge eclipse of sun and moon  and that the affrighted globe should yawn  
424,even as he said this a star of some pallor rose in his memory 
425,the night was dark  it was pitch dark  but it was such a night as this that they had waited for  it was on such a night as this that they had planned to fly 
426,he remembered everything 
427,the time had come 
428,with a burst of passion he snatched sasha to him  and hissed in her ear  jour de ma vie  
429,it was their signal 
430,at midnight they would meet at an inn near blackfriars 
431,horses waited there 
432,everything was in readiness for their flight 
433,so they parted  she to her tent  he to his 
434,it still wanted an hour of the time 
435,long before midnight orlando was in waiting 
436,the night was of so inky a blackness that a man was on you before he could be seen  which was all to the good  but it was also of the most solemn stillness so that a horse own hoof  or a child own cry  could be heard at a distance of half a mile 
437,many a time did orlando  pacing the little courtyard  hold his heart at the sound of some nag own steady footfall on the cobbles  or at the rustle of a woman own dress 
438,but the traveller was only some merchant  making home belated  or some woman of the quarter whose errand was nothing so innocent 
439,they passed  and the street was quieter than before 
440,then those lights which burnt downstairs in the small  huddled quarters where the poor of the city lived moved up to the sleeping rooms  and then  one by one  were extinguished 
441,the street lanterns in these purlieus were few at most  and the negligence of the night watchman often suffered them to expire long before dawn 
442,the darkness then became even deeper than before 
443,orlando looked to the wicks of his lantern  saw to the saddle girths  primed his pistols  examined his holsters  and did all these things a dozen times at least till he could find nothing more needing his attention 
444,though it still lacked some twenty minutes to midnight  he could not bring himself to go indoors to the inn parlour  where the hostess was still serving sack and the cheaper sort of canary wine to a few seafaring men  who would sit there trolling their ditties  and telling their stories of drake  hawkins  and grenville  till they toppled off the benches and rolled asleep on the sanded floor 
445,the darkness was more compassionate to his swollen and violent heart 
446,he listened to every footfall  speculated on every sound 
447,each drunken shout and each wail from some poor wretch laid in the straw or in other distress cut his heart to the quick  as if it boded ill omen to his venture 
448,yet  he had no fear for sasha 
449,her courage made nothing of the adventure 
450,she would come alone  in her cloak and trousers  booted like a man 
451,light as her footfall was  it would hardly be heard  even in this silence 
452,so he waited in the darkness 
453,suddenly he was struck in the face by a blow  soft  yet heavy  on the side of his cheek 
454,so strung with expectation was he  that he started and put his hand to his sword 
455,the blow was repeated a dozen times on forehead and cheek 
456,the dry frost had lasted so long that it took him a minute to realize that these were raindrops falling  the blows were the blows of the rain 
457,at first  they fell slowly  deliberately  one by one 
458,but soon the six drops became sixty  then six hundred  then ran themselves together in a steady spout of water 
459,it was as if the hard and consolidated sky poured itself forth in one profuse fountain 
460,in the space of five minutes orlando was soaked to the skin 
461,hastily putting the horses under cover  he sought shelter beneath the lintel of the door whence he could still observe the courtyard 
462,the air was thicker now than ever  and such a steaming and droning rose from the downpour that no footfall of man or beast could be heard above it 
463,the roads  pitted as they were with great holes  would be under water and perhaps impassable 
464,but of what effect this would have upon their flight he scarcely thought 
465,all his senses were bent upon gazing along the cobbled pathway  gleaming in the light of the lantern  for sasha own coming 
466,sometimes  in the darkness  he seemed to see her wrapped about with rain strokes 
467,but the phantom vanished 
468,suddenly  with an awful and ominous voice  a voice full of horror and alarm which raised every hair of anguish in orlando own soul  st paul own struck the first stroke of midnight 
469,four times more it struck remorselessly 
470,with the superstition of a lover  orlando had made out that it was on the sixth stroke that she would come 
471,but the sixth stroke echoed away  and the seventh came and the eighth  and to his apprehensive mind they seemed notes first heralding and then proclaiming death and disaster 
472,when the twelfth struck he knew that his doom was sealed 
473,it was useless for the rational part of him to reason  she might be late  she might be prevented  she might have missed her way 
474,the passionate and feeling heart of orlando knew the truth 
475,other clocks struck  jangling one after another 
476,the whole world seemed to ring with the news of her deceit and his derision 
477,the old suspicions subterraneously at work in him rushed forth from concealment openly 
478,he was bitten by a swarm of snakes  each more poisonous than the last 
479,he stood in the doorway in the tremendous rain without moving 
480,as the minutes passed  he sagged a little at the knees 
481,the downpour rushed on 
482,in the thick of it  great guns seemed to boom 
483,huge noises as of the tearing and rending of oak trees could be heard 
484,there were also wild cries and terrible inhuman groanings 
485,but orlando stood there immovable till paul own clock struck two  and then  crying aloud with an awful irony  and all his teeth showing   jour de ma vie   he dashed the lantern to the ground  mounted his horse and galloped he knew not where 
486,some blind instinct  for he was past reasoning  must have driven him to take the river bank in the direction of the sea 
487,for when the dawn broke  which it did with unusual suddenness  the sky turning a pale yellow and the rain almost ceasing  he found himself on the banks of the thames off wapping 
488,now a sight of the most extraordinary nature met his eyes 
489,where  for three months and more  there had been solid ice of such thickness that it seemed permanent as stone  and a whole gay city had been stood on its pavement  was now a race of turbulent yellow waters 
490,the river had gained its freedom in the night 
491,it was as if a sulphur spring  to which view many philosophers inclined  had risen from the volcanic regions beneath and burst the ice asunder with such vehemence that it swept the huge and massy fragments furiously apart 
492,the mere look of the water was enough to turn one giddy 
493,all was riot and confusion 
494,the river was strewn with icebergs 
495,some of these were as broad as a bowling green and as high as a house  others no bigger than a man own hat  but most fantastically twisted 
496,now would come down a whole convoy of ice blocks sinking everything that stood in their way 
497,now  eddying and swirling like a tortured serpent  the river would seem to be hurtling itself between the fragments and tossing them from bank to bank  so that they could be heard smashing against the piers and pillars 
498,but what was the most awful and inspiring of terror was the sight of the human creatures who had been trapped in the night and now paced their twisting and precarious islands in the utmost agony of spirit 
499,whether they jumped into the flood or stayed on the ice their doom was certain 
500,sometimes quite a cluster of these poor creatures would come down together  some on their knees  others suckling their babies 
501,one old man seemed to be reading aloud from a holy book 
502,at other times  and his fate perhaps was the most dreadful  a solitary wretch would stride his narrow tenement alone 
503,as they swept out to sea  some could be heard crying vainly for help  making wild promises to amend their ways  confessing their sins and vowing altars and wealth if god would hear their prayers 
504,others were so dazed with terror that they sat immovable and silent looking steadfastly before them 
505,one crew of young watermen or post boys  to judge by their liveries  roared and shouted the lewdest tavern songs  as if in bravado  and were dashed against a tree and sunk with blasphemies on their lips 
506,an old nobleman  for such his furred gown and golden chain proclaimed him  went down not far from where orlando stood  calling vengeance upon the irish rebels  who  he cried with his last breath  had plotted this devilry 
507,many perished clasping some silver pot or other treasure to their breasts  and at least a score of poor wretches were drowned by their own cupidity  hurling themselves from the bank into the flood rather than let a gold goblet escape them  or see before their eyes the disappearance of some furred gown 
508,for furniture  valuables  possessions of all sorts were carried away on the icebergs 
509,among other strange sights was to be seen a cat suckling its young  a table laid sumptuously for a supper of twenty  a couple in bed  together with an extraordinary number of cooking utensils 
510,dazed and astounded  orlando could do nothing for some time but watch the appalling race of waters as it hurled itself past him 
511,at last  seeming to recollect himself  he clapped spurs to his horse and galloped hard along the river bank in the direction of the sea 
512,rounding a bend of the river  he came opposite that reach where  not two days ago  the ships of the ambassadors had seemed immovably frozen 
513,hastily  he made count of them all  the french  the spanish  the austrian  the turk 
514,all still floated  though the french had broken loose from her moorings  and the turkish vessel had taken a great rent in her side and was fast filling with water 
515,but the russian ship was nowhere to be seen 
516,for one moment orlando thought it must have foundered  but  raising himself in his stirrups and shading his eyes  which had the sight of a hawk own  he could just make out the shape of a ship on the horizon 
517,the black eagles were flying from the mast head 
518,the ship of the muscovite embassy was standing out to sea 
519,flinging himself from his horse  he made  in his rage  as if he would breast the flood 
520,standing knee deep in water he hurled at the faithless woman all the insults that have ever been the lot of her sex 
521,faithless  mutable  fickle  he called her  devil  adulteress  deceiver  and the swirling waters took his words  and tossed at his feet a broken pot and a little straw 
522,the biographer is now faced with a difficulty which it is better perhaps to confess than to gloss over 
523,up to this point in telling the story of orlando own life  documents  both private and historical  have made it possible to fulfil the first duty of a biographer  which is to plod  without looking to right or left  in the indelible footprints of truth  unenticed by flowers  regardless of shade  on and on methodically till we fall plump into the grave and write finis on the tombstone above our heads 
524,but now we come to an episode which lies right across our path  so that there is no ignoring it 
525,yet it is dark  mysterious  and undocumented  so that there is no explaining it 
526,volumes might be written in interpretation of it  whole religious systems founded upon the signification of it 
527,our simple duty is to state the facts as far as they are known  and so let the reader make of them what he may 
528,in the summer of that disastrous winter which saw the frost  the flood  the deaths of many thousands  and the complete downfall of orlando own hopes  for he was exiled from court  in deep disgrace with the most powerful nobles of his time  the irish house of desmond was justly enraged  the king had already trouble enough with the irish not to relish this further addition  in that summer orlando retired to his great house in the country and there lived in complete solitude 
529,one june morning  it was saturday the th  he failed to rise at his usual hour  and when his groom went to call him he was found fast asleep 
530,nor could he be awakened 
531,he lay as if in a trance  without perceptible breathing  and though dogs were set to bark under his window  cymbals  drums  bones beaten perpetually in his room  a gorse bush put under his pillow  and mustard plasters applied to his feet  still he did not wake  take food  or show any sign of life for seven whole days 
532,on the seventh day he woke at his usual time  a quarter before eight  precisely  and turned the whole posse of caterwauling wives and village soothsayers out of his room  which was natural enough  but what was strange was that he showed no consciousness of any such trance  but dressed himself and sent for his horse as if he had woken from a single night own slumber 
533,yet some change  it was suspected  must have taken place in the chambers of his brain  for though he was perfectly rational and seemed graver and more sedate in his ways than before  he appeared to have an imperfect recollection of his past life 
534,he would listen when people spoke of the great frost or the skating or the carnival  but he never gave any sign  except by passing his hand across his brow as if to wipe away some cloud  of having witnessed them himself 
535,when the events of the past six months were discussed  he seemed not so much distressed as puzzled  as if he were troubled by confused memories of some time long gone or were trying to recall stories told him by another 
536,it was observed that if russia was mentioned or princesses or ships  he would fall into a gloom of an uneasy kind and get up and look out of the window or call one of the dogs to him  or take a knife and carve a piece of cedar wood 
537,but the doctors were hardly wiser then than they are now  and after prescribing rest and exercise  starvation and nourishment  society and solitude  that he should lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner  together with the usual sedatives and irritants  diversified  as the fancy took them  with possets of newt own slobber on rising  and draughts of peacock own gall on going to bed  they left him to himself  and gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a week 
538,but if sleep it was  of what nature  we can scarcely refrain from asking  are such sleeps as these 
539,are they remedial measures  trances in which the most galling memories  events that seem likely to cripple life for ever  are brushed with a dark wing which rubs their harshness off and gilds them  even the ugliest and basest  with a lustre  an incandescence 
540,has the finger of death to be laid on the tumult of life from time to time lest it rend us asunder 
541,are we so made that we have to take death in small doses daily or we could not go on with the business of living 
542,and then what strange powers are these that penetrate our most secret ways and change our most treasured possessions without our willing it 
543,had orlando  worn out by the extremity of his suffering  died for a week  and then come to life again 
544,and if so  of what nature is death and of what nature life 
545,having waited well over half an hour for an answer to these questions  and none coming  let us get on with the story 
546,now orlando gave himself up to a life of extreme solitude 
547,his disgrace at court and the violence of his grief were partly the reason of it  but as he made no effort to defend himself and seldom invited anyone to visit him  though he had many friends who would willingly have done so  it appeared as if to be alone in the great house of his fathers suited his temper 
548,solitude was his choice 
549,how he spent his time  nobody quite knew 
550,the servants  of whom he kept a full retinue  though much of their business was to dust empty rooms and to smooth the coverlets of beds that were never slept in  watched  in the dark of the evening  as they sat over their cakes and ale  a light passing along the galleries  through the banqueting halls  up the staircase  into the bedrooms  and knew that their master was perambulating the house alone 
551,none dared follow him  for the house was haunted by a great variety of ghosts  and the extent of it made it easy to lose one own way and either fall down some hidden staircase or open a door which  should the wind blow it to  would shut upon one for ever  accidents of no uncommon occurrence  as the frequent discovery of the skeletons of men and animals in attitudes of great agony made evident 
552,then the light would be lost altogether  and mrs grimsditch  the housekeeper  would say to mr dupper  the chaplain  how she hoped his lordship had not met with some bad accident 
553,mr dupper would opine that his lordship was on his knees  no doubt  among the tombs of his ancestors in the chapel  which was in the billiard table court  half a mile away on the south side 
554,for he had sins on his conscience  mr dupper was afraid  upon which mrs grimsditch would retort  rather sharply  that so had most of us  and mrs stewkley and mrs field and old nurse carpenter would all raise their voices in his lordship own praise  and the grooms and the stewards would swear that it was a thousand pities to see so fine a nobleman moping about the house when he might be hunting the fox or chasing the deer  and even the little laundry maids and scullery maids  the judys and the faiths  who were handing round the tankards and cakes  would pipe up their testimony to his lordship own gallantry  for never was there a kinder gentleman  or one more free with those little pieces of silver which serve to buy a knot of ribbon or put a posy in one own hair  until even the blackamoor whom they called grace robinson by way of making a christian woman of her  understood what they were at  and agreed that his lordship was a handsome  pleasant  darling gentleman in the only way she could  that is to say by showing all her teeth at once in a broad grin 
555,in short  all his serving men and women held him in high respect  and cursed the foreign princess  but they called her by a coarser name than that  who had brought him to this pass 
556,but though it was probably cowardice  or love of hot ale  that led mr dupper to imagine his lordship safe among the tombs so that he need not go in search of him  it may well have been that mr dupper was right 
557,orlando now took a strange delight in thoughts of death and decay  and  after pacing the long galleries and ballrooms with a taper in his hand  looking at picture after picture as if he sought the likeness of somebody whom he could not find  would mount into the family pew and sit for hours watching the banners stir and the moonlight waver with a bat or death own head moth to keep him company 
558,even this was not enough for him  but he must descend into the crypt where his ancestors lay  coffin piled upon coffin  for ten generations together 
559,the place was so seldom visited that the rats made free with the lead work  and now a thigh bone would catch at his cloak as he passed  or he would crack the skull of some old sir malise as it rolled beneath his foot 
560,it was a ghastly sepulchre  dug deep beneath the foundations of the house as if the first lord of the family  who had come from france with the conqueror  had wished to testify how all pomp is built upon corruption  how the skeleton lies beneath the flesh  how we that dance and sing above must lie below  how the crimson velvet turns to dust  how the ring  here orlando  stooping his lantern  would pick up a gold circle lacking a stone  that had rolled into a corner  loses its ruby and the eye which was so lustrous shines no more 
561, nothing remains of all these princes   orlando would say  indulging in some pardonable exaggeration of their rank   except one digit   and he would take a skeleton hand in his and bend the joints this way and that 
562, whose hand was it   he went on to ask 
563, the right or the left  the hand of man or woman  of age or youth  had it urged the war horse  or plied the needle  had it plucked the rose  or grasped cold steel  had it    but here either his invention failed him or  what is more likely  provided him with so many instances of what a hand can do that he shrank  as his will not was  from the cardinal labour of composition  which is excision  and he put it with the other bones  thinking how there was a writer called thomas browne  a doctor of norwich  whose writing upon such subjects took his fancy amazingly 
564,so  taking his lantern and seeing that the bones were in order  for though romantic  he was singularly methodical and detested nothing so much as a ball of string on the floor  let alone the skull of an ancestor  he returned to that curious  moody pacing down the galleries  looking for something among the pictures  which was interrupted at length by a veritable spasm of sobbing  at the sight of a dutch snow scene by an unknown artist 
565,then it seemed to him that life was not worth living any more 
566,forgetting the bones of his ancestors and how life is founded on a grave  he stood there shaken with sobs  all for the desire of a woman in russian trousers  with slanting eyes  a pouting mouth and pearls about her neck 
567,she had gone 
568,she had left him 
569,he was never to see her again 
570,and so he sobbed 
571,and so he found his way back to his own rooms  and mrs grimsditch  seeing the light in the window  put the tankard from her lips and said praise be to god  his lordship was safe in his room again  for she had been thinking all this while that he was foully murdered 
572,orlando now drew his chair up to the table  opened the works of sir thomas browne and proceeded to investigate the delicate articulation of one of the doctor own longest and most marvellously contorted cogitations 
573,for though these are not matters on which a biographer can profitably enlarge it is plain enough to those who have done a reader own part in making up from bare hints dropped here and there the whole boundary and circumference of a living person  can hear in what we only whisper a living voice  can see  often when we say nothing about it  exactly what he looked like  know without a word to guide them precisely what he thought  and it is for readers such as these that we write  it is plain then to such a reader that orlando was strangely compounded of many humours  of melancholy  of indolence  of passion  of love of solitude  to say nothing of all those contortions and subtleties of temper which were indicated on the first page  when he slashed at a dead nigger own head  cut it down  hung it chivalrously out of his reach again and then betook himself to the windowseat with a book 
574,the taste for books was an early one 
575,as a child he was sometimes found at midnight by a page still reading 
576,they took his taper away  and he bred glow worms to serve his purpose 
577,they took the glow worms away  and he almost burnt the house down with a tinder 
578,to put it in a nutshell  leaving the novelist to smooth out the crumpled silk and all its implications  he was a nobleman afflicted with a love of literature 
579,many people of his time  still more of his rank  escaped the infection and were thus free to run or ride or make love at their own sweet will 
580,but some were early infected by a germ said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel and to be blown out of greece and italy  which was of so deadly a nature that it would shake the hand as it was raised to strike  and cloud the eye as it sought its prey  and make the tongue stammer as it declared its love 
581,it was the fatal nature of this disease to substitute a phantom for reality  so that orlando  to whom fortune had given every gift  plate  linen  houses  men servants  carpets  beds in profusion  had only to open a book for the whole vast accumulation to turn to mist 
582,the nine acres of stone which were his house vanished  one hundred and fifty indoor servants disappeared  his eighty riding horses became invisible  it would take too long to count the carpets  sofas  trappings  china  plate  cruets  chafing dishes and other movables often of beaten gold  which evaporated like so much sea mist under the miasma 
583,so it was  and orlando would sit by himself  reading  a naked man 
584,the disease gained rapidly upon him now in his solitude 
585,he would read often six hours into the night  and when they came to him for orders about the slaughtering of cattle or the harvesting of wheat  he would push away his folio and look as if he did not understand what was said to him 
586,this was bad enough and wrung the hearts of hall  the falconer  of giles  the groom  of mrs grimsditch  the housekeeper  of mr dupper  the chaplain 
587,a fine gentleman like that  they said  had no need of books 
588,let him leave books  they said  to the palsied or the dying 
589,but worse was to come 
590,for once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which dwells in the inkpot and festers in the quill 
591,the wretch takes to writing 
592,and while this is bad enough in a poor man  whose only property is a chair and a table set beneath a leaky roof  for he has not much to lose  after all  the plight of a rich man  who has houses and cattle  maidservants  asses and linen  and yet writes books  is pitiable in the extreme 
593,the flavour of it all goes out of him  he is riddled by hot irons  gnawed by vermin 
594,he would give every penny he has  such is the malignity of the germ  to write one little book and become famous  yet all the gold in peru will not buy him the treasure of a well turned line 
595,so he falls into consumption and sickness  blows his brains out  turns his face to the wall 
596,it matters not in what attitude they find him 
597,he has passed through the gates of death and known the flames of hell 
598,happily  orlando was of a strong constitution and the disease  for reasons presently to be given  never broke him down as it has broken many of his peers 
599,but he was deeply smitten with it  as the sequel shows 
600,for when he had read for an hour or so in sir thomas browne  and the bark of the stag and the call of the night watchman showed that it was the dead of night and all safe asleep  he crossed the room  took a silver key from his pocket and unlocked the doors of a great inlaid cabinet which stood in the corner 
601,within were some fifty drawers of cedar wood and upon each was a paper neatly written in orlando own hand 
602,he paused  as if hesitating which to open 
603,one was inscribed  the death of ajax   another  the birth of pyramus   another  iphigenia in aulis   another  the death of hippolytus   another  meleager   another  the return of odysseus    in fact there was scarcely a single drawer that lacked the name of some mythological personage at a crisis of his career 
604,in each drawer lay a document of considerable size all written over in orlando own hand 
605,the truth was that orlando had been afflicted thus for many years 
606,never had any boy begged apples as orlando begged paper  nor sweetmeats as he begged ink 
607,stealing away from talk and games  he had hidden himself behind curtains  in priest own holes  or in the cupboard behind his mother own bedroom which had a great hole in the floor and smelt horribly of starling own dung  with an inkhorn in one hand  a pen in another  and on his knee a roll of paper 
608,thus had been written  before he was turned twenty five  some forty seven plays  histories  romances  poems  some in prose  some in verse  some in french  some in italian  all romantic  and all long 
609,one he had had printed by john ball of the feathers and coronet opposite st paul own cross  cheapside  but though the sight of it gave him extreme delight  he had never dared show it even to his mother  since to write  much more to publish  was  he knew  for a nobleman an inexpiable disgrace 
610,now  however  that it was the dead of night and he was alone  he chose from this repository one thick document called  xenophila a tragedy  or some such title  and one thin one  called simply  the oak tree   this was the only monosyllabic title among the lot   and then he approached the inkhorn  fingered the quill  and made other such passes as those addicted to this vice begin their rites with 
611,but he paused 
612,as this pause was of extreme significance in his history  more so  indeed  than many acts which bring men to their knees and make rivers run with blood  it behoves us to ask why he paused  and to reply  after due reflection  that it was for some such reason as this 
613,nature  who has played so many queer tricks upon us  making us so unequally of clay and diamonds  of rainbow and granite  and stuffed them into a case  often of the most incongruous  for the poet has a butcher own face and the butcher a poet own  nature  who delights in muddle and mystery  so that even now  the first of november   we know not why we go upstairs  or why we come down again  our most daily movements are like the passage of a ship on an unknown sea  and the sailors at the mast head ask  pointing their glasses to the horizon  is there land or is there none 
614,to which  if we are prophets  we make answer  yes   if we are truthful we say  no   nature  who has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence  has further complicated her task and added to our confusion by providing not only a perfect rag bag of odds and ends within us  a piece of a policeman own trousers lying cheek by jowl with queen alexandra own wedding veil  but has contrived that the whole assortment shall be lightly stitched together by a single thread 
615,memory is the seamstress  and a capricious one at that 
616,memory runs her needle in and out  up and down  hither and thither 
617,we know not what comes next  or what follows after 
618,thus  the most ordinary movement in the world  such as sitting down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one  may agitate a thousand odd  disconnected fragments  now bright  now dim  hanging and bobbing and dipping and flaunting  like the underlinen of a family of fourteen on a line in a gale of wind 
619,instead of being a single  downright  bluff piece of work of which no man need feel ashamed  our commonest deeds are set about with a fluttering and flickering of wings  a rising and falling of lights 
620,thus it was that orlando  dipping his pen in the ink  saw the mocking face of the lost princess and asked himself a million questions instantly which were as arrows dipped in gall 
621,where was she  and why had she left him 
622,was the ambassador her uncle or her lover 
623,had they plotted 
624,was she forced 
625,was she married 
626,was she dead   all of which so drove their venom into him that  as if to vent his agony somewhere  he plunged his quill so deep into the inkhorn that the ink spirted over the table  which act  explain it how one may  and no explanation perhaps is possible  memory is inexplicable   at once substituted for the face of the princess a face of a very different sort 
627,but whose was it  he asked himself 
628,and he had to wait  perhaps half a minute  looking at the new picture which lay on top of the old  as one lantern slide is half seen through the next  before he could say to himself   this is the face of that rather fat  shabby man who sat in twitchett own room ever so many years ago when old queen bess came here to dine  and i saw him   orlando continued  catching at another of those little coloured rags   ownitting at the table  as i peeped in on my way downstairs  and he had the most amazing eyes   said orlando   that ever were  but who the devil was he  
629,orlando asked  for here memory added to the forehead and eyes  first  a coarse  grease stained ruffle  then a brown doublet  and finally a pair of thick boots such as citizens wear in cheapside 
630, not a nobleman  not one of us   said orlando  which he would not have said aloud  for he was the most courteous of gentlemen  but it shows what an effect noble birth has upon the mind and incidentally how difficult it is for a nobleman to be a writer    a poet  i dare say  
631,by all the laws  memory  having disturbed him sufficiently  should now have blotted the whole thing out completely  or have fetched up something so idiotic and out of keeping  like a dog chasing a cat or an old woman blowing her nose into a red cotton handkerchief  that  in despair of keeping pace with her vagaries  orlando should have struck his pen in earnest against his paper 
632, for we can  if we have the resolution  turn the hussy  memory  and all her ragtag and bobtail out of the house  
633,but orlando paused 
634,memory still held before him the image of a shabby man with big  bright eyes 
635,still he looked  still he paused 
636,it is these pauses that are our undoing 
637,it is then that sedition enters the fortress and our troops rise in insurrection 
638,once before he had paused  and love with its horrid rout  its shawms  its cymbals  and its heads with gory locks torn from the shoulders had burst in 
639,from love he had suffered the tortures of the damned 
640,now  again  he paused  and into the breach thus made  leapt ambition  the harridan  and poetry  the witch  and desire of fame  the strumpet  all joined hands and made of his heart their dancing ground 
641,standing upright in the solitude of his room  he vowed that he would be the first poet of his race and bring immortal lustre upon his name 
642,he said  reciting the names and exploits of his ancestors  that sir boris had fought and killed the paynim  sir gawain  the turk  sir miles  the pole  sir andrew  the frank  sir richard  the austrian  sir jordan  the frenchman  and sir herbert  the spaniard 
643,but of all that killing and campaigning  that drinking and love making  that spending and hunting and riding and eating  what remained 
644,a skull  a finger 
645,whereas  he said  turning to the page of sir thomas browne  which lay open upon the table  and again he paused  like an incantation rising from all parts of the room  from the night wind and the moonlight  rolled the divine melody of those words which  lest they should outstare this page  we will leave where they lie entombed  not dead  embalmed rather  so fresh is their colour  so sound their breathing  and orlando  comparing that achievement with those of his ancestors  cried out that they and their deeds were dust and ashes  but this man and his words were immortal 
646,he soon perceived  however  that the battles which sir miles and the rest had waged against armed knights to win a kingdom  were not half so arduous as this which he now undertook to win immortality against the english language 
647,anyone moderately familiar with the rigours of composition will not need to be told the story in detail  how he wrote and it seemed good  read and it seemed vile  corrected and tore up  cut out  put in  was in ecstasy  in despair  had his good nights and bad mornings  snatched at ideas and lost them  saw his book plain before him and it vanished  acted his people own parts as he ate  mouthed them as he walked  now cried  now laughed  vacillated between this style and that  now preferred the heroic and pompous  next the plain and simple  now the vales of tempe  then the fields of kent or cornwall  and could not decide whether he was the divinest genius or the greatest fool in the world 
648,it was to settle this last question that he decided after many months of such feverish labour  to break the solitude of years and communicate with the outer world 
649,he had a friend in london  one giles isham  of norfolk  who  though of gentle birth  was acquainted with writers and could doubtless put him in touch with some member of that blessed  indeed sacred  fraternity 
650,for  to orlando in the state he was now in  there was a glory about a man who had written a book and had it printed  which outshone all the glories of blood and state 
651,to his imagination it seemed as if even the bodies of those instinct with such divine thoughts must be transfigured 
652,they must have aureoles for hair  incense for breath  and roses must grow between their lips  which was certainly not true either of himself or mr dupper  he could think of no greater happiness than to be allowed to sit behind a curtain and hear them talk  even the imagination of that bold and various discourse made the memory of what he and his courtier friends used to talk about  a dog  a horse  a woman  a game of cards  seem brutish in the extreme 
653,he bethought him with pride that he had always been called a scholar  and sneered at for his love of solitude and books 
654,he had never been apt at pretty phrases 
655,he would stand stock still  blush  and stride like a grenadier in a ladies  drawing room 
656,he had twice fallen  in sheer abstraction  from his horse 
657,he had broken lady winchilsea own fan once while making a rhyme 
658,eagerly recalling these and other instances of his unfitness for the life of society  an ineffable hope  that all the turbulence of his youth  his clumsiness  his blushes  his long walks  and his love of the country proved that he himself belonged to the sacred race rather than to the noble  was by birth a writer  rather than an aristocrat  possessed him 
659,for the first time since the night of the great flood he was happy 
660,he now commissioned mr isham of norfolk to deliver to mr nicholas greene of clifford own inn a document which set forth orlando own admiration for his works  for nick greene was a very famous writer at that time  and his desire to make his acquaintance  which he scarcely dared ask  for he had nothing to offer in return  but if mr nicholas greene would condescend to visit him  a coach and four would be at the corner of fetter lane at whatever hour mr greene chose to appoint  and bring him safely to orlando own house 
661,one may fill up the phrases which then followed  and figure orlando own delight when  in no long time  mr greene signified his acceptance of the noble lord own invitation  took his place in the coach and was set down in the hall to the south of the main building punctually at seven of the clock on monday  april the twenty first 
662,many kings  queens  and ambassadors had been received there  judges had stood there in their ermine 
663,the loveliest ladies of the land had come there  and the sternest warriors 
664,banners hung there which had been at flodden and at agincourt 
665,there were displayed the painted coats of arms with their lions and their leopards and their coronets 
666,there were the long tables where the gold and silver plate was stood  and there the vast fireplaces of wrought italian marble where nightly a whole oak tree  with its million leaves and its nests of rook and wren  was burnt to ashes 
667,nicholas greene  the poet stood there now  plainly dressed in his slouched hat and black doublet  carrying in one hand a small bag 
668,that orlando as he hastened to greet him was slightly disappointed was inevitable 
669,the poet was not above middle height  was of a mean figure  was lean and stooped somewhat  and  stumbling over the mastiff on entering  the dog bit him 
670,moreover  orlando for all his knowledge of mankind was puzzled where to place him 
671,there was something about him which belonged neither to servant  squire  or noble 
672,the head with its rounded forehead and beaked nose was fine  but the chin receded 
673,the eyes were brilliant  but the lips hung loose and slobbered 
674,it was the expression of the face  as a whole  however  that was disquieting 
675,there was none of that stately composure which makes the faces of the nobility so pleasing to look at  nor had it anything of the dignified servility of a well trained domestic own face  it was a face seamed  puckered  and drawn together 
676,poet though he was  it seemed as if he were more used to scold than to flatter  to quarrel than to coo  to scramble than to ride  to struggle than to rest  to hate than to love 
677,this  too  was shown by the quickness of his movements  and by something fiery and suspicious in his glance 
678,orlando was somewhat taken aback 
679,but they went to dinner 
680,here  orlando  who usually took such things for granted  was  for the first time  unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of the splendour of his table 
681,stranger still  he bethought him with pride  for the thought was generally distasteful  of that great grandmother moll who had milked the cows 
682,he was about somehow to allude to this humble woman and her milk pails  when the poet forestalled him by saying that it was odd  seeing how common the name of greene was  that the family had come over with the conqueror and was of the highest nobility in france 
683,unfortunately  they had come down in the world and done little more than leave their name to the royal borough of greenwich 
684,further talk of the same sort  about lost castles  coats of arms  cousins who were baronets in the north  intermarriage with noble families in the west  how some greens spelt the name with an e at the end  and others without  lasted till the venison was on the table 
685,then orlando contrived to say something of grandmother moll and her cows  and had eased his heart a little of its burden by the time the wild fowl were before them 
686,but it was not until the malmsey was passing freely that orlando dared mention what he could not help thinking a more important matter than the greens or the cows  that is to say the sacred subject of poetry 
687,at the first mention of the word  the poet own eyes flashed fire  he dropped the fine gentleman airs he had worn  thumped his glass on the table  and launched into one of the longest  most intricate  most passionate  and bitterest stories that orlando had ever heard  save from the lips of a jilted woman  about a play of his  another poet  and a critic 
688,of the nature of poetry itself  orlando only gathered that it was harder to sell than prose  and though the lines were shorter took longer in the writing 
689,so the talk went on with ramifications interminable  until orlando ventured to hint that he had himself been so rash as to write  but here the poet leapt from his chair 
690,a mouse had squeaked in the wainscot  he said 
691,the truth was  he explained  that his nerves were in a state where a mouse own squeak upset them for a fortnight 
692,doubtless the house was full of vermin  but orlando had not heard them 
693,the poet then gave orlando the full story of his health for the past ten years or so 
694,it had been so bad that one could only marvel that he still lived 
695,he had had the palsy  the gout  the ague  the dropsy  and the three sorts of fever in succession  added to which he had an enlarged heart  a great spleen  and a diseased liver 
696,but  above all  he had  he told orlando  sensations in his spine which defied description 
697,there was one knob about the third from the top which burnt like fire  another about second from the bottom which was cold as ice 
698,sometimes he woke with a brain like lead  at others it was as if a thousand wax tapers were alight and people were throwing fireworks inside him 
699,he could feel a rose leaf through his mattress  he said  and knew his way almost about london by the feel of the cobbles 
700,altogether he was a piece of machinery so finely made and curiously put together  here he raised his hand as if unconsciously  and indeed it was of the finest shape imaginable  that it confounded him to think that he had only sold five hundred copies of his poem  but that of course was largely due to the conspiracy against him 
701,all he could say  he concluded  banging his fist upon the table  was that the art of poetry was dead in england 
702,how that could be with shakespeare  marlowe  ben jonson  browne  donne  all now writing or just having written  orlando  reeling off the names of his favourite heroes  could not think 
703,greene laughed sardonically 
704,shakespeare  he admitted  had written some scenes that were well enough  but he had taken them chiefly from marlowe 
705,marlowe was a likely boy  but what could you say of a lad who died before he was thirty 
706,as for browne  he was for writing poetry in prose  and people soon got tired of such conceits as that 
707,donne was a mountebank who wrapped up his lack of meaning in hard words 
708,the gulls were taken in  but the style would be out of fashion twelve months hence 
709,as for ben jonson  ben jonson was a friend of his and he never spoke ill of his friends 
710,no  he concluded  the great age of literature is past  the great age of literature was the greek  the elizabethan age was inferior in every respect to the greek 
711,in such ages men cherished a divine ambition which he might call la gloire  he pronounced it glawr  so that orlando did not at first catch his meaning  
712,now all young writers were in the pay of the booksellers and poured out any trash that would sell 
713,shakespeare was the chief offender in this way and shakespeare was already paying the penalty 
714,their own age  he said  was marked by precious conceits and wild experiments  neither of which the greeks would have tolerated for a moment  much though it hurt him to say it  for he loved literature as he loved his life  he could see no good in the present and had no hope for the future 
715,here he poured himself out another glass of wine 
716,orlando was shocked by these doctrines  yet could not help observing that the critic himself seemed by no means downcast 
717,on the contrary  the more he denounced his own time  the more complacent he became 
718,he could remember  he said  a night at the cock tavern in fleet street when kit marlowe was there and some others 
719,kit was in high feather  rather drunk  which he easily became  and in a mood to say silly things 
720,he could see him now  brandishing his glass at the company and hiccoughing out   owntap my vitals  bill   this was to shakespeare    there is a great wave coming and you are on the top of it   by which he meant  greene explained  that they were trembling on the verge of a great age in english literature  and that shakespeare was to be a poet of some importance 
721,happily for himself  he was killed two nights later in a drunken brawl  and so did not live to see how this prediction turned out 
722, poor foolish fellow   said greene   to go and say a thing like that  a great age  forsooth  the elizabethan a great age  
723, owno  my dear lord   he continued  settling himself comfortably in his chair and rubbing the wine glass between his fingers   we must make the best of it  cherish the past and honour those writers  there are still a few of  them  who take antiquity for their model and write  not for pay but for glawr    orlando could have wished him a better accent    glawr   said greene   is the spur of noble minds  had i a pension of three hundred pounds a year paid quarterly  i would live for glawr alone  i would lie in bed every morning reading cicero  i would imitate his style so that you could not tell the difference between us  that is what i call fine writing   said greene   that is what i call glawr  but it is necessary to have a pension to do it  
724,by this time orlando had abandoned all hope of discussing his own work with the poet  but this mattered the less as the talk now got upon the lives and characters of shakespeare  ben jonson  and the rest  all of whom greene had known intimately and about whom he had a thousand anecdotes of the most amusing kind to tell 
725,orlando had never laughed so much in his life 
726,these  then  were his gods 
727,half were drunken and all were amorous 
728,most of them quarrelled with their wives  not one of them was above a lie or an intrigue of the most paltry kind 
729,their poetry was scribbled down on the backs of washing bills held to the heads of printer own devils at the street door 
730,thus hamlet went to press  thus lear  thus othello 
731,no wonder  as greene said  that these plays show the faults they do 
732,the rest of the time was spent in carousings and junketings in taverns and in beer gardens  when things were said that passed belief for wit  and things were done that made the utmost frolic of the courtiers seem pale in comparison 
733,all this greene told with a spirit that roused orlando to the highest pitch of delight 
734,he had a power of mimicry that brought the dead to life  and could say the finest things of books provided they were written three hundred years ago 
735,so time passed  and orlando felt for his guest a strange mixture of liking and contempt  of admiration and pity  as well as something too indefinite to be called by any one name  but had something of fear in it and something of fascination 
736,he talked incessantly about himself  yet was such good company that one could listen to the story of his ague for ever 
737,then he was so witty  then he was so irreverent  then he made so free with the names of god and woman  then he was so full of queer crafts and had such strange lore in his head  could make salad in three hundred different ways  knew all that could be known of the mixing of wines  played half a dozen musical instruments  and was the first person  and perhaps the last  to toast cheese in the great italian fireplace 
738,that he did not know a geranium from a carnation  an oak from a birch tree  a mastiff from a greyhound  a teg from a ewe  wheat from barley  plough land from fallow  was ignorant of the rotation of the crops  thought oranges grew underground and turnips on trees  preferred any townscape to any landscape   all this and much more amazed orlando  who had never met anybody of his kind before 
739,even the maids  who despised him  tittered at his jokes  and the men servants  who loathed him  hung about to hear his stories 
740,indeed  the house had never been so lively as now that he was there  all of which gave orlando a great deal to think about  and caused him to compare this way of life with the old 
741,he recalled the sort of talk he had been used to about the king of spain own apoplexy or the mating of a bitch  he bethought him how the day passed between the stables and the dressing closet  he remembered how the lords snored over their wine and hated anybody who woke them up 
742,he bethought him how active and valiant they were in body  how slothful and timid in mind 
743,worried by these thoughts  and unable to strike a proper balance  he came to the conclusion that he had admitted to his house a plaguey spirit of unrest that would never suffer him to sleep sound again 
744,at the same moment  nick greene came to precisely the opposite conclusion 
745,lying in bed of a morning on the softest pillows between the smoothest sheets and looking out of his oriel window upon turf which for centuries had known neither dandelion nor dock weed  he thought that unless he could somehow make his escape  he should be smothered alive 
746,getting up and hearing the pigeons coo  dressing and hearing the fountains fall  he thought that unless he could hear the drays roar upon the cobbles of fleet street  he would never write another line 
747,if this goes on much longer  he thought  hearing the footman mend the fire and spread the table with silver dishes next door  i shall fall asleep and  here he gave a prodigious yawn  sleeping die 
748,so he sought orlando in his room  and explained that he had not been able to sleep a wink all night because of the silence 
749, indeed  the house was surrounded by a park fifteen miles in circumference and a wall ten feet high  
750,silence  he said  was of all things the most oppressive to his nerves 
751,he would end his visit  by orlando own leave  that very morning 
752,orlando felt some relief at this  yet also a great reluctance to let him go 
753,the house  he thought  would seem very dull without him 
754,on parting  for he had never yet liked to mention the subject   he had the temerity to press his play upon the death of hercules upon the poet and ask his opinion of it 
755,the poet took it  muttered something about glawr and cicero  which orlando cut short by promising to pay the pension quarterly  whereupon greene  with many protestations of affection  jumped into the coach and was gone 
756,the great hall had never seemed so large  so splendid  or so empty as the chariot rolled away 
757,orlando knew that he would never have the heart to make toasted cheese in the italian fireplace again 
758,he would never have the wit to crack jokes about italian pictures  never have the skill to mix punch as it should be mixed  a thousand good quips and cranks would be lost to him 
759,yet what a relief to be out of the sound of that querulous voice  what a luxury to be alone once more  so he could not help reflecting  as he unloosed the mastiff which had been tied up these six weeks because it never saw the poet without biting him 
760,nick greene was set down at the corner of fetter lane that same afternoon  and found things going on much as he had left them 
761,mrs greene  that is to say  was giving birth to a baby in one room  tom fletcher was drinking gin in another 
762,books were tumbled all about the floor  dinner  such as it was  was set on a dressing table where the children had been making mud pies 
763,but this  greene felt  was the atmosphere for writing  here he could write  and write he did 
764,the subject was made for him 
765,a noble lord at home 
766,a visit to a nobleman in the country  his new poem was to have some such title as that 
767,seizing the pen with which his little boy was tickling the cat own ears  and dipping it in the egg cup which served for inkpot  greene dashed off a very spirited satire there and then 
768,it was so done to a turn that no one could doubt that the young lord who was roasted was orlando  his most private sayings and doings  his enthusiasms and folies  down to the very colour of his hair and the foreign way he had of rolling his r own  were there to the life 
769,and if there had been any doubt about it  greene clinched the matter by introducing  with scarcely any disguise  passages from that aristocratic tragedy  the death of hercules  which he found as he expected  wordy and bombastic in the extreme 
770,the pamphlet  which ran at once into several editions  and paid the expenses of mrs greene own tenth lying in  was soon sent by friends who take care of such matters to orlando himself 
771,when he had read it  which he did with deadly composure from start to finish  he rang for the footman  delivered the document to him at the end of a pair of tongs  bade him drop it in the filthiest heart of the foulest midden on the estate 
772,then  when the man was turning to go he stopped him   take the swiftest horse in the stable   he said   ride for dear life to harwich  there embark upon a ship which you will find bound for norway  buy for me from the king own own kennels the finest elk hounds of the royal strain  male and female  bring them back without delay  for   he murmured  scarcely above his breath as he turned to his books   i have done with men  
773,the footman  who was perfectly trained in his duties  bowed and disappeared 
774,he fulfilled his task so efficiently that he was back that day three weeks  leading in his hand a leash of the finest elk hounds  one of whom  a female  gave birth that very night under the dinner table to a litter of eight fine puppies 
775,orlando had them brought to his bedchamber 
776, for   he said   i have done with men 
777,nevertheless  he paid the pension quarterly 
778,thus  at the age of thirty  or thereabouts  this young nobleman had not only had every experience that life has to offer  but had seen the worthlessness of them all 
779,love and ambition  women and poets were all equally vain 
780,literature was a farce 
781,the night after reading greene own visit to a nobleman in the country  he burnt in a great conflagration fifty seven poetical works  only retaining  the oak tree   which was his boyish dream and very short 
782,two things alone remained to him in which he now put any trust  dogs and nature  an elk hound and a rose bush 
783,the world  in all its variety  life in all its complexity  had shrunk to that 
784,dogs and a bush were the whole of it 
785,so feeling quit of a vast mountain of illusion  and very naked in consequence  he called his hounds to him and strode through the park 
786,so long had he been secluded  writing and reading  that he had half forgotten the amenities of nature  which in june can be great 
787,when he reached that high mound whence on fine days half of england with a slice of wales and scotland thrown in can be seen  he flung himself under his favourite oak tree and felt that if he need never speak to another man or woman so long as he lived  if his dogs did not develop the faculty of speech  if he never met a poet or a princess again  he might make out what years remained to him in tolerable content 
788,here he came then  day after day  week after week  month after month  year after year 
789,he saw the beech trees turn golden and the young ferns unfurl  he saw the moon sickle and then circular  he saw  but probably the reader can imagine the passage which should follow and how every tree and plant in the neighbourhood is described first green  then golden  how moons rise and suns set  how spring follows winter and autumn summer  how night succeeds day and day night  how there is first a storm and then fine weather  how things remain much as they are for two or three hundred years or so  except for a little dust and a few cobwebs which one old woman can sweep up in half an hour  a conclusion which  one cannot help feeling  might have been reached more quickly by the simple statement that  time passed   here the exact amount could be indicated in brackets  and nothing whatever happened 
790,but time  unfortunately  though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and fade with amazing punctuality  has no such simple effect upon the mind of man 
791,the mind of man  moreover  works with equal strangeness upon the body of time 
792,an hour  once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit  may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length  on the other hand  an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second 
793,this extraordinary discrepancy between time on the clock and time in the mind is less known than it should be and deserves fuller investigation 
794,but the biographer  whose interests are  as we have said  highly restricted  must confine himself to one simple statement  when a man has reached the age of thirty  as orlando now had  time when he is thinking becomes inordinately long  time when he is doing becomes inordinately short 
795,thus orlando gave his orders and did the business of his vast estates in a flash  but directly he was alone on the mound under the oak tree  the seconds began to round and fill until it seemed as if they would never fall 
796,they filled themselves  moreover  with the strangest variety of objects 
797,for not only did he find himself confronted by problems which have puzzled the wisest of men  such as what is love 
798,what friendship 
799,what truth 
800,but directly he came to think about them  his whole past  which seemed to him of extreme length and variety  rushed into the falling second  swelled it a dozen times its natural size  coloured it a thousand tints  and filled it with all the odds and ends in the universe 
801,in such thinking  or by whatever name it should be called  he spent months and years of his life 
802,it would be no exaggeration to say that he would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come home to dinner a man of fifty five at least 
803,some weeks added a century to his age  others no more than three seconds at most 
804,altogether  the task of estimating the length of human life  of the animals  we presume not to speak  is beyond our capacity  for directly we say that it is ages long  we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground 
805,of the two forces which alternately  and what is more confusing still  at the same moment  dominate our unfortunate numbskulls  brevity and diuturnity  orlando was sometimes under the influence of the elephant footed deity  then of the gnat winged fly 
806,life seemed to him of prodigious length 
807,yet even so  it went like a flash 
808,but even when it stretched longest and the moments swelled biggest and he seemed to wander alone in deserts of vast eternity  there was no time for the smoothing out and deciphering of those scored parchments which thirty years among men and women had rolled tight in his heart and brain 
809,long before he had done thinking about love  the oak tree had put forth its leaves and shaken them to the ground a dozen times in the process  ambition would jostle it off the field  to be replaced by friendship or literature 
810,and as the first question had not been settled  what is love   back it would come at the least provocation or none  and hustle books or metaphors of what one lives for into the margin  there to wait till they saw their chance to rush into the field again 
811,what made the process still longer was that it was profusely illustrated  not only with pictures  as that of old queen elizabeth  laid on her tapestry couch in rose coloured brocade with an ivory snuff box in her hand and a gold hilted sword by her side  but with scents  she was strongly perfumed  and with sounds  the stags were barking in richmond park that winter own day 
812,and so  the thought of love would be all ambered over with snow and winter  with log fires burning  with russian women  gold swords  and the bark of stags  with old king james  slobbering and fireworks and sacks of treasure in the holds of elizabethan sailing ships 
813,every single thing  once he tried to dislodge it from its place in his mind  he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of glass which  after a year at the bottom of the sea  is grown about with bones and dragon flies  and coins and the tresses of drowned women 
814, another metaphor by jupiter   he would exclaim as he said this  which will show the disorderly and circuitous way in which his mind worked and explain why the oak tree flowered and faded so often before he came to any conclusion about love  
815, and what is the point of it   he would ask himself 
816, why not say simply in so many words    and then he would try to think for half an hour   or was it two years and a half   how to say simply in so many words what love is 
817, a figure like that is manifestly untruthful   he argued   for no dragon fly  unless under very exceptional circumstances  could live at the bottom of the sea  and if literature is not the bride and bedfellow of truth  what is she  confound it all   he cried   why say bedfellow when one own already said bride  why not simply say what one means and leave it  
818,so then he tried saying the grass is green and the sky is blue and so to propitiate the austere spirit of poetry whom still  though at a great distance  he could not help reverencing 
819, the sky is blue   he said   the grass is green  
820,looking up  he saw that  on the contrary  the sky is like the veils which a thousand madonnas have let fall from their hair  and the grass fleets and darkens like a flight of girls fleeing the embraces of hairy satyrs from enchanted woods 
821, upon my word   he said  for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking aloud    i do not see that one own more true than another  both are utterly false  
822,and he despaired of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep dejection 
823,and here we may profit by a pause in his soliloquy to reflect how odd it was to see orlando stretched there on his elbow on a june day and to reflect that this fine fellow with all his faculties about him and a healthy body  witness cheeks and limbs  a man who never thought twice about heading a charge or fighting a duel  should be so subject to the lethargy of thought  and rendered so susceptible by it  that when it came to a question of poetry  or his own competence in it  he was as shy as a little girl behind her mother own cottage door 
824,in our belief  greene own ridicule of his tragedy hurt him as much as the princess  ridicule of his love 
825,but to return   
826,orlando went on thinking 
827,he kept looking at the grass and at the sky and trying to bethink him what a true poet  who has his verses published in london  would say about them 
828,memory meanwhile  whose habits have already been described  kept steady before his eyes the face of nicholas greene  as if that sardonic loose lipped man  treacherous as he had proved himself  were the muse in person  and it was to him that orlando must do homage 
829,so orlando  that summer morning  offered him a variety of phrases  some plain  others figured  and nick greene kept shaking his head and sneering and muttering something about glawr and cicero and the death of poetry in our time 
830,at length  starting to his feet  it was now winter and very cold  orlando swore one of the most remarkable oaths of his lifetime  for it bound him to a servitude than which none is stricter 
831, I will be blasted   he said   if i ever write another word  or try to write another word  to please nick greene or the muse 
832,bad  good  or indifferent  I will write  from this day forward  to please myself   and here he made as if he were tearing a whole budget of papers across and tossing them in the face of that sneering loose lipped man 
833,upon which  as a cur ducks if you stoop to shy a stone at him  memory ducked her effigy of nick greene out of sight  and substituted for it  nothing whatever 
834,but orlando  all the same  went on thinking 
835,he had indeed much to think of 
836,for when he tore the parchment across  he tore  in one rending  the scrolloping  emblazoned scroll which he had made out in his own favour in the solitude of his room appointing himself  as the king appoints ambassadors  the first poet of his race  the first writer of his age  conferring eternal immortality upon his soul and granting his body a grave among laurels and the intangible banners of a people own reverence perpetually 
837,eloquent as this all was  he now tore it up and threw it in the dustbin 
838, fame   he said 
839, is like   and since there was no nick greene to stop him  he went on to revel in images of which we will choose only one or two of the quietest   a braided coat which hampers the limbs  a jacket of silver which curbs the heart  a painted shield which covers a scarecrow   etc  etc 
840,the pith of his phrases was that while fame impedes and constricts  obscurity wraps about a man like a mist  obscurity is dark  ample  and free  obscurity let us the mind take its way unimpeded 
841,over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness 
842,none knows where he goes or comes 
843,he may seek the truth and speak it  he alone is free  he alone is truthful  he alone is at peace 
844,and so he sank into a quiet mood  under the oak tree  the hardness of whose roots  exposed above the ground  seemed to him rather comfortable than otherwise 
845,sunk for a long time in profound thoughts as to the value of obscurity  and the delight of having no name  but being like a wave which returns to the deep body of the sea  thinking how obscurity rids the mind of the irk of envy and spite  how it sets running in the veins the free waters of generosity and magnanimity  and allows giving and taking without thanks offered or praise given  which must have been the way of all great poets  he supposed  though his knowledge of greek was not enough to bear him out   for  he thought  shakespeare must have written like that  and the church builders built like that  anonymously  needing no thanking or naming  but only their work in the daytime and a little ale perhaps at night   what an admirable life this is   he thought  stretching his limbs out under the oak tree 
846, and why not enjoy it this very moment  
847,the thought struck him like a bullet 
848,ambition dropped like a plummet 
849,rid of the heart burn of rejected love  and of vanity rebuked  and all the other stings and pricks which the nettle bed of life had burnt upon him when ambitious of fame  but could no longer inflict upon one careless of glory  he opened his eyes  which had been wide open all the time  but had seen only thoughts  and saw  lying in the hollow beneath him  his house 
850,there it lay in the early sunshine of spring 
851,it looked a town rather than a house  but a town built  not hither and thither  as this man wished or that  but circumspectly  by a single architect with one idea in his head 
852,courts and buildings  grey  red  plum colour  lay orderly and symmetrical  the courts were some of them oblong and some square  in this was a fountain  in that a statue  the buildings were some of them low  some pointed  here was a chapel  there a belfry  spaces of the greenest grass lay in between and clumps of cedar trees and beds of bright flowers  all were clasped  yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly  by the roll of a massive wall  while smoke from innumerable chimneys curled perpetually into the air 
853,this vast  yet ordered building  which could house a thousand men and perhaps two thousand horses  was built  orlando thought  by workmen whose names are unknown 
854,here have lived  for more centuries than i can count  the obscure generations of my own obscure family 
855,not one of these richards  johns  annes  elizabeths has left a token of himself behind him  yet all  working together with their spades and their needles  their love making and their child bearing  have left this 
856,never had the house looked more noble and humane 
857,why  then  had he wished to raise himself above them 
858,for it seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that anonymous work of creation  the labours of those vanished hands 
859,better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch  a potting she would  a wall where peaches ripen  than to burn like a meteor and leave no dust 
860,for after all  he said  kindling as he looked at the great house on the greensward below  the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who come after  for the roof that will leak  for the tree that will fall 
861,there was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the kitchen  always food for the hungry  always their goblets were polished  though they lay sick  and their windows were lit though they lay dying 
862,lords though they were  they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone mason 
863,obscure noblemen  forgotten builders  thus he apostrophized them with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him cold  indifferent  slothful  the truth being that a quality often lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it   thus he apostrophized his house and race in terms of the most moving eloquence  but when it came to the peroration  and what is eloquence that lacks a peroration   he fumbled 
864,he would have liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building 
865,since  however  the building already covered nine acres  to add even a single stone seemed superfluous 
866,could one mention furniture in a peroration 
867,could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to lie beside people own beds 
868,for whatever the peroration wanted  that was what the house stood in need of 
869,leaving his speech unfinished for the moment  he strode down hill again resolved henceforward to devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion 
870,the news  that she was to attend him instantly  brought tears to the eyes of good old mrs grimsditch  now grown somewhat old 
871,together they perambulated the house 
872,the towel horse in the king own bedroom   and that was king jamie  my lord   she said  hinting that it was many a day since a king had slept under their roof  but the odious parliament days were over and there was now a crown in england again  lacked a leg  there were no stands to the ewers in the little closet leading into the waiting room of the duchess own page  mr greene had made a stain on the carpet with his nasty pipe smoking  which she and judy  for all their scrubbing  had never been able to wash out 
873,indeed  when orlando came to reckon up the matter of furnishing with rosewood chairs and cedar wood cabinets  with silver basins  china bowls  and persian carpets  every one of the three hundred and sixty five bedrooms which the house contained  he saw that it would be no light one  and if some thousands of pounds of his estate remained over  these would do little more than hang a few galleries with tapestry  set the dining hall with fine  carved chairs and provide mirrors of solid silver and chairs of the same metal  for which he had an inordinate passion  for the furnishing of the royal bedchambers 
874,he now set to work in earnest  as we can prove beyond a doubt if we look at his ledgers 
875,let us glance at an inventory of what he bought at this time  with the expenses totted up in the margin  but these we omit 
876, to fifty pairs of spanish blankets  ditto curtains of crimson and white taffeta  the valence to them of white satin embroidered with crimson and white silk   
877, to seventy yellow satin chairs and sixty stools  suitable with their buckram covers to them all   
878, to sixty seven walnut tree tables   
879, to seventeen dozen boxes containing each dozen five dozen of venice glasses   
880, to one hundred and two mats  each thirty yards long   
881, to ninety seven cushions of crimson damask laid with silver parchment lace and footstools of cloth of tissue and chairs suitable   
882, to fifty branches for a dozen lights apiece    
883,already  it is an effect lists have upon us  we are beginning to yawn 
884,but if we stop  it is only that the catalogue is tedious  not that it is finished 
885,there are ninety nine pages more of it and the total sum disbursed ran into many thousands  that is to say millions of our money 
886,and if his day was spent like this  at night again  lord orlando might be found reckoning out what it would cost to level a million molehills  if the men were paid tenpence an hour  and again  how many hundredweight of nails at fivepence halfpenny a gill were needed to repair the fence round the park  which was fifteen miles in circumference 
887,and so on and so on 
888,the tale  we say  is tedious  for one cupboard is much like another  and one molehill not much different from a million 
889,some pleasant journeys it cost him  and some fine adventures 
890,as  for instance  when he set a whole city of blind women near bruges to stitch hangings for a silver canopied bed  and the story of his adventure with a moor in venice of whom he bought  but only at the sword own point  his lacquered cabinet  might  in other hands  prove worth the telling 
891,nor did the work lack variety  for here would come  drawn by teams from sussex  great trees  to be sawn across and laid along the gallery for flooring  and then a chest from persia  stuffed with wool and sawdust 
892,from which  at last  he would take a single plate  or one topaz ring 
893,at length  however  there was no room in the galleries for another table  no room on the tables for another cabinet  no room in the cabinet for another rose bowl  no room in the bowl for another handful of potpourri  there was no room for anything anywhere  in short the house was furnished 
894,in the garden snowdrops  crocuses  hyacinths  magnolias  roses  lilies  asters  the dahlia in all its varieties  pear trees and apple trees and cherry trees and mulberry trees  with an enormous quantity of rare and flowering shrubs  of trees evergreen and perennial  grew so thick on each other own roots that there was no plot of earth without its bloom  and no stretch of sward without its shade 
895,in addition  he had imported wild fowl with gay plumage  and two malay bears  the surliness of whose manners concealed  he was certain  trusty hearts 
896,all now was ready  and when it was evening and the innumerable silver sconces were lit and the light airs which for ever moved about the galleries stirred the blue and green arras  so that it looked as if the huntsmen were riding and daphne flying  when the silver shone and lacquer glowed and wood kindled  when the carved chairs held their arms out and dolphins swam upon the walls with mermaids on their backs  when all this and much more than all this was complete and to his liking  orlando walked through the house with his elk hounds following and felt content 
897,he had matter now  he thought  to fill out his peroration 
898,perhaps it would be well to begin the speech all over again 
899,yet  as he paraded the galleries he felt that still something was lacking 
900,chairs and tables  however richly gilt and carved  sofas  resting on lions  paws with swans  necks curving under them  beds even of the softest swansdown are not by themselves enough 
901,people sitting in them  people lying in them improve them amazingly 
902,accordingly orlando now began a series of very splendid entertainments to the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood 
903,the three hundred and sixty five bedrooms were full for a month at a time 
904,guests jostled each other on the fifty two staircases 
905,three hundred servants bustled about the pantries 
906,banquets took place almost nightly 
907,thus  in a very few years  orlando had worn the nap off his velvet  and spent the half of his fortune  but he had earned the good opinion of his neighbours 
908,held a score of offices in the county  and was annually presented with perhaps a dozen volumes dedicated to his lordship in rather fulsome terms by grateful poets 
909,for though he was careful not to consort with writers at that time and kept himself always aloof from ladies of foreign blood  still  he was excessively generous both to women and to poets  and both adored him 
910,but when the feasting was at its height and his guests were at their revels  he was apt to take himself off to his private room alone 
911,there when the door was shut  and he was certain of privacy  he would have out an old writing book  stitched together with silk stolen from his mother own workbox  and labelled in a round schoolboy hand   the oak tree  a poem  
912,in this he would write till midnight chimed and long after 
913,but as he scratched out as many lines as he wrote in  the sum of them was often  at the end of the year  rather less than at the beginning  and it looked as if in the process of writing the poem would be completely unwritten 
914,for it is for the historian of letters to remark that he had changed his style amazingly 
915,his floridity was chastened  his abundance curbed  the age of prose was congealing those warm fountains 
916,the very landscape outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars themselves were less thorned and intricate 
917,perhaps the senses were a little duller and honey and cream less seductive to the palate 
918,also that the streets were better drained and the houses better lit had its effect upon the style  it cannot be doubted 
919,one day he was adding a line or two with enormous labour to  the oak tree  a poem   when a shadow crossed the tail of his eye 
920,it was no shadow  he soon saw  but the figure of a very tall lady in riding hood and mantle crossing the quadrangle on which his room looked out 
921,as this was the most private of the courts  and the lady was a stranger to him  orlando marvelled how she had got there 
922,three days later the same apparition appeared again  and on wednesday noon appeared once more 
923,this time  orlando was determined to follow her  nor apparently was she afraid to be found  for she slackened her steps as he came up and looked him full in the face 
924,any other woman thus caught in a lord own private grounds would have been afraid  any other woman with that face  head dress  and aspect would have thrown her mantilla across her shoulders to hide it 
925,for this lady resembled nothing so much as a hare  a hare startled  but obdurate  a hare whose timidity is overcome by an immense and foolish audacity  a hare that sits upright and glowers at its pursuer with great  bulging eyes  with ears erect but quivering  with nose pointed  but twitching 
926,this hare  moreover  was six feet high and wore a head dress into the bargain of some antiquated kind which made her look still taller 
927,thus confronted  she stared at orlando with a stare in which timidity and audacity were most strangely combined 
928,first  she asked him  with a proper  but somewhat clumsy curtsey  to forgive her her intrusion 
929,then  rising to her full height again  which must have been something over six feet two  she went on to say  but with such a cackle of nervous laughter  so much tee heeing and haw hawing that orlando thought she must have escaped from a lunatic asylum  that she was the archduchess harriet griselda of finster aarhorn and scand op boom in the roumanian territory 
930,she desired above all things to make his acquaintance  she said 
931,she had taken lodging over a baker own shop at the park gates 
932,she had seen his picture and it was the image of a sister of hers who was  here she guffawed  long since dead 
933,she was visiting the english court 
934,the queen was her cousin 
935,the king was a very good fellow but seldom went to bed sober 
936,here she tee heed and haw hawed again 
937,in short  there was nothing for it but to ask her in and give her a glass of wine 
938,indoors  her manners regained the hauteur natural to a roumanian archduchess  and had she not shown a knowledge of wines rare in a lady  and made some observations upon firearms and the customs of sportsmen in her country  which were sensible enough  the talk would have lacked spontaneity 
939,jumping to her feet at last  she announced that she would call the following day  swept another prodigious curtsey and departed 
940,the following day  orlando rode out 
941,the next  he turned his back  on the third he drew his curtain 
942,on the fourth it rained  and as he could not keep a lady in the wet  nor was altogether averse to company  he invited her in and asked her opinion whether a suit of armour  which belonged to an ancestor of his  was the work of jacobi or of topp 
943,he inclined to topp 
944,she held another opinion  it matters very little which 
945,but it is of some importance to the course of our story that  in illustrating her argument  which had to do with the working of the tie pieces  the archduchess harriet took the golden shin case and fitted it to orlando own leg 
946,that he had a pair of the shapliest legs that any nobleman has ever stood upright upon has already been said 
947,perhaps something in the way she fastened the ankle buckle  or her stooping posture  or orlando own long seclusion  or the natural sympathy which is between the sexes  or the burgundy  or the fire  any of these causes may have been to blame  for certainly blame there is on one side or another  when a nobleman of orlando own breeding  entertaining a lady in his house  and she his elder by many years  with a face a yard long and staring eyes  dressed somewhat ridiculously too  in a mantle and riding cloak though the season was warm  blame there is when such a nobleman is so suddenly and violently overcome by passion of some sort that he has to leave the room 
948,but what sort of passion  it may well be asked  could this be 
949,and the answer is double faced as love herself 
950,for love  but leaving love out of the argument for a moment  the actual event was this 
951,when the archduchess harriet griselda stooped to fasten the buckle  orlando heard  suddenly and unaccountably  far off the beating of love own wings 
952,the distant stir of that soft plumage roused in him a thousand memories of rushing waters  of loveliness in the snow and faithlessness in the flood  and the sound came nearer  and he blushed and trembled  and he was moved as he had thought never to be moved again  and he was ready to raise his hands and let the bird of beauty alight upon his shoulders  when  horror   a creaking sound like that the crows make tumbling over the trees began to reverberate  the air seemed dark with coarse black wings  voices croaked  bits of straw  twigs  and feathers dropped  and there pitched down upon his shoulders the heaviest and foulest of the birds  which is the vulture 
953,thus he rushed from the room and sent the footman to see the archduchess harriet to her carriage 
954,for love  to which we may now return  has two faces  one white  the other black  two bodies  one smooth  the other hairy 
955,it has two hands  two feet  two nails  two  indeed  of every member and each one is the exact opposite of the other 
956,yet  so strictly are they joined together that you cannot separate them 
957,in this case  orlando own love began her flight towards him with her white face turned  and her smooth and lovely body outwards 
958,nearer and nearer she came wafting before her airs of pure delight 
959,all of a sudden  at the sight of the archduchess presumably  she wheeled about  turned the other way round  showed herself black  hairy  brutish  and it was lust the vulture  not love  the bird of paradise  that flopped  foully and disgustingly  upon his shoulders 
960,hence he ran  hence he fetched the footman 
961,but the harpy is not so easily banished as all that 
962,not only did the archduchess continue to lodge at the baker own  but orlando was haunted every day and night by phantoms of the foulest kind 
963,vainly  it seemed  had he furnished his house with silver and hung the walls with arras  when at any moment a dung bedraggled fowl could settle upon his writing table 
964,there she was  flopping about among the chairs  he saw her waddling ungracefully across the galleries 
965,now  she perched  top heavy upon a fire screen 
966,when he chased her out  back she came and pecked at the glass till she broke it 
967,thus realizing that his home was uninhabitable  and that steps must be taken to end the matter instantly  he did what any other young man would have done in his place  and asked king charles to send him as ambassador extraordinary to constantinople 
968,the king was walking in whitehall 
969,nell gwyn was on his arm 
970,she was pelting him with hazel nuts 
971,it was a thousand pities  that amorous lady sighed  that such a pair of legs should leave the country 
972,howbeit  the fates were hard  she could do no more than toss one kiss over her shoulder before orlando sailed 
973,it is  indeed  highly unfortunate  and much to be regretted that at this stage of orlando own career  when he played a most important part in the public life of his country  we have least information to go upon 
974,we know that he discharged his duties to admiration  witness his bath and his dukedom  we know that he had a finger in some of the most delicate negotiations between king charles and the turks  to that  treaties in the vault of the record office bear testimony 
975,but the revolution which broke out during his period of office  and the fire which followed  have so damaged or destroyed all those papers from which any trustworthy record could be drawn  that what we can give is lamentably incomplete 
976,often the paper was scorched a deep brown in the middle of the most important sentence 
977,just when we thought to elucidate a secret that has puzzled historians for a hundred years  there was a hole in the manuscript big enough to put your finger through 
978,we have done our best to piece out a meagre summary from the charred fragments that remain  but often it has been necessary to speculate  to surmise  and even to use the imagination 
979,orlando own day was passed  it would seem  somewhat in this fashion 
980,about seven  he would rise  wrap himself in a long turkish cloak  light a cheroot  and lean his elbows on the parapet 
981,thus he would stand  gazing at the city beneath him  apparently entranced 
982,at this hour the mist would lie so thick that the domes of santa sofia and the rest would seem to be afloat  gradually the mist would uncover them  the bubbles would be seen to be firmly fixed  there would be the river  there the galata bridge  there the green turbaned pilgrims without eyes or noses  begging alms  there the pariah dogs picking up offal  there the shawled women  there the innumerable donkeys  there men on horses carrying long poles 
983,soon  the whole town would be astir with the cracking of whips  the beating of gongs  cryings to prayer  lashing of mules  and rattle of brass bound wheels  while sour odours  made from bread fermenting and incense  and spice  rose even to the heights of pera itself and seemed the very breath of the strident multi coloured and barbaric population 
984,nothing  he reflected  gazing at the view which was now sparkling in the sun  could well be less like the counties of surrey and kent or the towns of london and tunbridge wells 
985,to the right and left rose in bald and stony prominence the inhospitable asian mountains  to which the arid castle of a robber chief or two might hang  but parsonage there was none  nor manor house  nor cottage  nor oak  elm  violet  ivy  or wild eglantine 
986,there were no hedges for ferns to grow on  and no fields for sheep to graze 
987,the houses were white as egg shells and as bald 
988,that he  who was english root and fibre  should yet exult to the depths of his heart in this wild panorama  and gaze and gaze at those passes and far heights planning journeys there alone on foot where only the goat and shepherd had gone before  should feel a passion of affection for the bright  unseasonable flowers  love the unkempt pariah dogs beyond even his elk hounds at home  and snuff the acrid  sharp smell of the streets eagerly into his nostrils  surprised him 
989,he wondered if  in the season of the crusades  one of his ancestors had taken up with a circassian peasant woman  thought it possible  fancied a certain darkness in his complexion  and  going indoors again  withdrew to his bath 
990,an hour later  properly scented  curled  and anointed  he would receive visits from secretaries and other high officials carrying  one after another  red boxes which yielded only to his own golden key 
991,within were papers of the highest importance  of which only fragments  here a flourish  there a seal firmly attached to a piece of burnt silk  now remain 
992,of their contents then  we cannot speak  but can only testify that orlando was kept busy  what with his wax and seals  his various coloured ribbons which had to be diversely attached  his engrossing of titles and making of flourishes round capital letters  till luncheon came  a splendid meal of perhaps thirty courses 
993,after luncheon  lackeys announced that his coach and six was at the door  and he went  preceded by purple janissaries running on foot and waving great ostrich feather fans above their heads  to call upon the other ambassadors and dignitaries of state 
994,the ceremony was always the same 
995,on reaching the courtyard  the janissaries struck with their fans upon the main portal  which immediately flew open revealing a large chamber  splendidly furnished 
996,here were seated two figures  generally of the opposite sexes 
997,profound bows and curtseys were exchanged 
998,in the first room  it was permissible only to mention the weather 
999,having said that it was fine or wet  hot or cold  the ambassador then passed on to the next chamber  where again  two figures rose to greet him 
1000,here it was only permissible to compare constantinople as a place of residence with london  and the ambassador naturally said that he preferred constantinople  and his hosts naturally said  though they had not seen it  that they preferred london 
1001,in the next chamber  king charles own and the sultan own healths had to be discussed at some length 
1002,in the next were discussed the ambassador own health and that of his host own wife  but more briefly 
1003,in the next the ambassador complimented his host upon his furniture  and the host complimented the ambassador upon his dress 
1004,in the next  sweet meats were offered  the host deploring their badness  the ambassador extolling their goodness 
1005,the ceremony ended at length with the smoking of a hookah and the drinking of a glass of coffee  but though the motions of smoking and drinking were gone through punctiliously there was neither tobacco in the pipe nor coffee in the glass  as  had either smoke or drink been real  the human frame would have sunk beneath the surfeit 
1006,for  no sooner had the ambassador despatched one such visit  than another had to be undertaken 
1007,the same ceremonies were gone through in precisely the same order six or seven times over at the houses of the other great officials  so that it was often late at night before the ambassador reached home 
1008,though orlando performed these tasks to admiration and never denied that they are  perhaps  the most important part of a diplomatist own duties  he was undoubtedly fatigued by them  and often depressed to such a pitch of gloom that he preferred to take his dinner alone with his dogs 
1009,to them  indeed  he might be heard talking in his own tongue 
1010,and sometimes  it is said  he would pass out of his own gates late at night so disguised that the sentries did not know him 
1011,then he would mingle with the crowd on the galata bridge  or stroll through the bazaars  or throw aside his shoes and join the worshippers in the mosques 
1012,once  when it was given out that he was ill of a fever  shepherds  bringing their goats to market  reported that they had met an english lord on the mountain top and heard him praying to his god 
1013,this was thought to be orlando himself  and his prayer was  no doubt  a poem said aloud  for it was known that he still carried about with him  in the bosom of his cloak  a much scored manuscript  and servants  listening at the door  heard the ambassador chanting something in an odd  sing song voice when he was alone 
1014,it is with fragments such as these that we must do our best to make up a picture of orlando own life and character at this time 
1015,there exist  even to this day  rumours  legends  anecdotes of a floating and unauthenticated kind about orlando own life in constantinople   we have quoted but a few of them  which go to prove that he possessed  now that he was in the prime of life  the power to stir the fancy and rivet the eye which will keep a memory green long after all that more durable qualities can do to preserve it is forgotten 
1016,the power is a mysterious one compounded of beauty  birth  and some rarer gift  which we may call glamour and have done with it 
1017, a million candles   as sasha had said  burnt in him without his being at the trouble of lighting a single one 
1018,he moved like a stag  without any need to think about his legs 
1019,he spoke in his ordinary voice and echo beat a silver gong 
1020,hence rumours gathered round him 
1021,he became the adored of many women and some men 
1022,it was not necessary that they should speak to him or even that they should see him  they conjured up before them especially when the scenery was romantic  or the sun was setting  the figure of a noble gentleman in silk stockings 
1023,upon the poor and uneducated  he had the same power as upon the rich 
1024,shepherds  gipsies  donkey drivers  still sing songs about the english lord  who dropped his emeralds in the well   which undoubtedly refer to orlando  who once  it seems  tore his jewels from him in a moment of rage or intoxication and flung them in a fountain  whence they were fished by a page boy 
1025,but this romantic power  it is well known  is often associated with a nature of extreme reserve 
1026,orlando seems to have made no friends 
1027,as far as is known  he formed no attachments 
1028,a certain great lady came all the way from england in order to be near him  and pestered him with her attentions  but he continued to discharge his duties so indefatigably that he had not been ambassador at the horn for more than two years and a half before king charles signified his intention of raising him to the highest rank in the peerage 
1029,the envious said that this was nell gwyn own tribute to the memory of a leg 
1030,but  as she had seen him once only  and was then busily engaged in pelting her royal master with nutshells  it is likely that it was his merits that won him his dukedom  not his calves 
1031,here we must pause  for we have reached a moment of great significance in his career 
1032,for the conferring of the dukedom was the occasion of a very famous  and indeed  much disputed incident  which we must now describe  picking our way among burnt papers and little bits of tape as best we may 
1033,it was at the end of the great fast of ramadan that the order of the bath and the patent of nobility arrived in a frigate commanded by sir adrian scrope  and orlando made this the occasion for an entertainment more splendid than any that has been known before or since in constantinople 
1034,the night was fine  the crowd immense  and the windows of the embassy brilliantly illuminated 
1035,again  details are lacking  for the fire had its way with all such records  and has left only tantalizing fragments which leave the most important points obscure 
1036,from the diary of john fenner brigge  however  an english naval officer  who was among the guests  we gather that people of all nationalities  were packed like herrings in a barrel  in the courtyard 
1037,the crowd pressed so unpleasantly close that brigge soon climbed into a judas tree  the better to observe the proceedings 
1038,the rumour had got about among the natives  and here is additional proof of orlando own mysterious power over the imagination  that some kind of miracle was to be performed 
1039, thus   writes brigge  but his manuscript is full of burns and holes  some sentences being quite illegible    when the rockets began to soar into the air  there was considerable uneasiness among us lest the native population should be seized   fraught with unpleasant consequences to all   english ladies in the company  i own that my hand went to my cutlass  happily   he continues in his somewhat long winded style   these fears seemed  for the moment  groundless and  observing the demeanour of the natives   i came to the conclusion that this demonstration of our skill in the art of pyrotechny was valuable  if only because it impressed upon them   the superiority of the british   indeed  the sight was one of indescribable magnificence  i found myself alternately praising the lord that he had permitted   and wishing that my poor  dear mother   by the ambassador own orders  the long windows  which are so imposing a feature of eastern architecture  for though ignorant in many ways   were thrown wide  and within  we could see a tableau vivant or theatrical display in which english ladies and gentlemen   represented a masque the work of one   the words were inaudible  but the sight of so many of our countrymen and women  dressed with the highest elegance and distinction   moved me to emotions of which i am certainly not ashamed  though unable   i was intent upon observing the astonishing conduct of lady  which was of a nature to fasten the eyes of all upon her  and to bring discredit upon her sex and country  when   unfortunately a branch of the judas tree broke  lieutenant brigge fell to the ground  and the rest of the entry records only his gratitude to providence  who plays a very large part in the diary  and the exact nature of his injuries 
1040,happily  miss penelope hartopp  daughter of the general of that name  saw the scene from inside and carries on the tale in a letter  much defaced too  which ultimately reached a female friend at tunbridge wells 
1041,miss penelope was no less lavish in her enthusiasm than the gallant officer 
1042, ravishing   she exclaims ten times on one page   wondrous   utterly beyond description   gold plate   candelabras   negroes in plush breeches    pyramids of ice   fountains of negus   jellies made to represent his majesty own ships   swans made to represent water lilies   birds in golden cages   gentlemen in slashed crimson velvet   ladies  headdresses at least six foot high   musical boxes    
1043,mr peregrine said i looked quite lovely which i only repeat to you  my dearest  because i know   oh  how i longed for you all 
1044,   surpassing anything we have seen at the pantiles   oceans to drink   some gentlemen overcome   lady betty ravishing    
1045,poor lady bonham made the unfortunate mistake of sitting down without a chair beneath her   gentlemen all very gallant   wished a thousand times for you and dearest betsy   but the sight of all others  the cynosure of all eyes   as all admitted  for none could be so vile as to deny it  was the ambassador himself 
1046,such a leg 
1047,such a countenance  
1048,such princely manners    to see him come into the room 
1049,to see him go out again 
1050,and something interesting in the expression  which makes one feel  one scarcely knows why  that he has suffered 
1051,they say a lady was the because of it 
1052,the heartless monster    how can one of our reputed tender sex have had the effrontery    he is unmarried  and half the ladies in the place are wild for love of him   a thousand  thousand kisses to tom  gerry  peter  and dearest mew    
1053,from the gazette of the time  we gather that  as the clock struck twelve  the ambassador appeared on the centre balcony which was hung with priceless rugs 
1054,six turks of the imperial body guard  each over six foot in height  held torches to his right and left 
1055,rockets rose into the air at his appearance  and a great shout went up from the people  which the ambassador acknowledged  bowing deeply  and speaking a few words of thanks in the turkish language  which it was one of his accomplishments to speak with fluency 
1056,next  sir adrian scrope  in the full dress of a british admiral  advanced  the ambassador knelt on one knee  the admiral placed the collar of the most noble order of the bath round his neck  then pinned the star to his breast  after which another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing in a stately manner placed on his shoulders the ducal robes  and handed him on a crimson cushion  the ducal coronet 
1057,at length  with a gesture of extraordinary majesty and grace  first bowing profoundly  then raising himself proudly erect  orlando took the golden circlet of strawberry leaves and placed it  with a gesture which none that saw it ever forgot  upon his brows 
1058,it was at this point that the first disturbance began 
1059,either the people had expected a miracle  some say a shower of gold was prophesied to fall from the skies  which did not happen  or this was the signal chosen for the attack to begin  nobody seems to know  but as the coronet settled on orlando own brows a great uproar rose 
1060,bells began ringing  the harsh cries of the prophets were heard above the shouts of the people  many turks fell flat to the ground and touched the earth with their foreheads 
1061,a door burst open 
1062,the natives pressed into the banqueting rooms 
1063,women shrieked 
1064,a certain lady  who was said to be dying for love of orlando  seized a candelabra and dashed it to the ground 
1065,what might not have happened  had it not been for the presence of sir adrian scrope and a squad of british bluejackets  nobody can say 
1066,but the admiral ordered the bugles to be sounded  a hundred bluejackets stood instantly at attention  the disorder was quelled  and quiet  at least for the time being  fell upon the scene 
1067,so far  we are on the firm  if rather narrow  ground of ascertained truth 
1068,but nobody has ever known exactly what took place later that night 
1069,the testimony of the sentries and others seems  however  to prove that the embassy was empty of company  and shut up for the night in the usual way by two a m 
1070,the ambassador was seen to go to his room  still wearing the insignia of his rank  and shut the door 
1071,some say he locked it  which was against his custom 
1072,others maintain that they heard music of a rustic kind  such as shepherds play  later that night in the courtyard under the ambassador own window 
1073,a washer woman  who was kept awake by toothache  said that she saw a man own figure  wrapped in a cloak or dressing gown  come out upon the balcony 
1074,then  she said  a woman  much muffled  but apparently of the peasant class  was drawn up by means of a rope which the man let down to her on to the balcony 
1075,there  the washer woman said  they embraced passionately  like lovers   and went into the room together  drawing the curtains so that no more could be seen 
1076,next morning  the duke  as we must now call him  was found by his secretaries sunk in profound slumber amid bed clothes that were much tumbled 
1077,the room was in some disorder  his coronet having rolled on the floor  and his cloak and garter being flung all of a heap on a chair 
1078,the table was littered with papers 
1079,no suspicion was felt at first  as the fatigues of the night had been great 
1080,but when afternoon came and he still slept  a doctor was summoned 
1081,he applied remedies which had been used on the previous occasion  plasters  nettles  emetics  etc   but without success 
1082,orlando slept on 
1083,his secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the papers on the table 
1084,many were scribbled over with poetry  in which frequent mention was made of an oak tree 
1085,there were also various state papers and others of a private nature concerning the management of his estates in england 
1086,but at length they came upon a document of far greater significance 
1087,it was nothing less  indeed  than a deed of marriage  drawn up  signed  and witnessed between his lordship  orlando  knight of the garter  etc   etc   etc   and rosina pepita  a dancer  father unknown  but reputed a gipsy  mother also unknown but reputed a seller of old iron in the market place over against the galata bridge 
1088,the secretaries looked at each other in dismay 
1089,and still orlando slept 
1090,morning and evening they watched him  but  save that his breathing was regular and his cheeks still flushed their habitual deep rose  he gave no sign of life 
1091,whatever science or ingenuity could do to waken him they did 
1092,but still he slept 
1093,on the seventh day of his trance  thursday  may the th  the first shot was fired of that terrible and bloody insurrection of which lieutenant brigge had detected the first symptoms 
1094,the turks rose against the sultan  set fire to the town  and put every foreigner they could find  either to the sword or to the bastinado 
1095,a few english managed to escape  but  as might have been expected  the gentlemen of the british embassy preferred to die in defence of their red boxes  or  in extreme cases  to swallow bunches of keys rather than let them fall into the hands of the infidel 
1096,the rioters broke into orlando own room  but seeing him stretched to all appearances dead they left him untouched  and only robbed him of his coronet and the robes of the garter 
1097,and now again obscurity descends  and would indeed that it were deeper 
1098,would  we almost have it in our hearts to exclaim  that it were so deep that we could see nothing whatever through its opacity 
1099,would that we might here take the pen and write finis to our work 
1100,would that we might spare the reader what is to come and say to him in so many words  orlando died and was buried 
1101,but here  alas  truth  candour  and honesty  the austere gods who keep watch and ward by the inkpot of the biographer  cry no 
1102,putting their silver trumpets to their lips they demand in one blast  truth 
1103,and again they cry truth  and sounding yet a third time in concert they peal forth  the truth and nothing but the truth 
1104,at which  heaven be praised  for it affords us a breathing space  the doors gently open  as if a breath of the gentlest and holiest zephyr had wafted them apart  and three figures enter 
1105,first  comes our lady of purity  whose brows are bound with fillets of the whitest lamb own wool  whose hair is as an avalanche of the driven snow  and in whose hand reposes the white quill of a virgin goose 
1106,following her  but with a statelier step  comes our lady of chastity  on whose brow is set like a turret of burning but unwasting fire a diadem of icicles  her eyes are pure stars  and her fingers  if they touch you  freeze you to the bone 
1107,close behind her  sheltering indeed in the shadow of her more stately sisters  comes our lady of modesty  frailest and fairest of the three  whose face is only shown as the young moon shows when it is thin and sickle shaped and half hidden among clouds 
1108,each advances towards the centre of the room where orlando still lies sleeping  and with gestures at once appealing and commanding  our lady of purity speaks first 
1109, i am the guardian of the sleeping fawn  the snow is dear to me  and the moon rising  and the silver sea 
1110,with my robes i cover the speckled hen own eggs and the brindled sea she will  i cover vice and poverty 
1111,on all things frail or dark or doubtful  my veil descends 
1112,wherefore  speak not  reveal not 
1113,spare  o spare  
1114,here the trumpets peal forth 
1115, purity avaunt 
1116,begone purity  
1117,then our lady of chastity speaks 
1118, i am she whose touch freezes and whose glance turns to stone 
1119,i have stayed the star in its dancing  and the wave as it falls 
1120,the highest alps are my dwelling place  and when i walk  the lightnings flash in my hair  where my eyes fall  they kill 
1121,rather than let orlando wake  i will freeze him to the bone 
1122,spare  o spare  
1123,here the trumpets peal forth 
1124, chastity avaunt 
1125,begone chastity  
1126,then our lady of modesty speaks  so low that one can hardly hear 
1127, i am she that men call modesty 
1128,virgin i am and ever shall be 
1129,not for me the fruitful fields and the fertile vineyard 
1130,increase is odious to me  and when the apples burgeon or the flocks breed  i run  i run  i let my mantle fall 
1131,my hair covers my eyes 
1132,i do not see 
1133,spare  o spare  
1134,again the trumpets peal forth 
1135, modesty avaunt 
1136,begone modesty  
1137,with gestures of grief and lamentation the three sisters now join hands and dance slowly  tossing their veils and singing as they go 
1138, truth come not out from your horrid den 
1139,hide deeper  fearful truth 
1140,for you flaunt in the brutal gaze of the sun things that were better unknown and undone  you unveil the shameful  the dark you make clear  hide 
1141,hide 
1142,hide  
1143,here they make as if to cover orlando with their draperies 
1144,the trumpets  meanwhile  still blare forth 
1145, the truth and nothing but the truth 
1146,at this the sisters try to cast their veils over the mouths of the trumpets so as to muffle them  but in vain  for now all the trumpets blare forth together 
1147, horrid sisters  go  
1148,the sisters become distracted and wail in unison  still circling and flinging their veils up and down 
1149, it has not always been so 
1150,but men want us no longer  the women detest us 
1151,we go  we go 
1152,i  purity says this  to the hen roost 
1153,i  chastity says this  to the still unravished heights of surrey 
1154,i  modesty says this  to any cosy nook where there are ivy and curtains in plenty 
1155, for there  not here  all speak together joining hands and making gestures of farewell and despair towards the bed where orlando lies sleeping  dwell still in nest and boudoir  office and lawcourt those who love us  those who honour us  virgins and city men  lawyers and doctors  those who prohibit  those who deny  those who reverence without knowing why  those who praise without understanding  the still very numerous  heaven be praised  tribe of the respectable  who prefer to see not  desire to know not  love the darkness  those still worship us  and with reason  for we have given them wealth  prosperity  comfort  ease 
1156,to them we go  you we leave 
1157,come  sisters  come 
1158,this is no place for us here 
1159,they retire in haste  waving their draperies over their heads  as if to shut out something that they dare not look upon and close the door behind them 
1160,we are  therefore  now left entirely alone in the room with the sleeping orlando and the trumpeters 
1161,the trumpeters  ranging themselves side by side in order  blow one terrific blast   
1162, the truth 
1163,at which orlando woke 
1164,he stretched himself 
1165,he rose 
1166,he stood upright in complete nakedness before us  and while the trumpets pealed truth 
1167,truth 
1168,truth  we have no choice left but confess  he was a woman 
1169,the sound of the trumpets died away and orlando stood stark naked 
1170,no human being  since the world began  has ever looked more ravishing 
1171,his form combined in one the strength of a man and a woman own grace 
1172,as he stood there  the silver trumpets prolonged their note  as if reluctant to leave the lovely sight which their blast had called forth  and chastity  purity  and modesty  inspired  no doubt  by curiosity  peeped in at the door and threw a garment like a towel at the naked form which  unfortunately  fell short by several inches 
1173,orlando looked himself up and down in a long looking glass  without showing any signs of discomposure  and went  presumably  to his bath 
1174,we may take advantage of this pause in the narrative to make certain statements 
1175,orlando had become a woman  there is no denying it  but in every other respect  orlando remained precisely as he had been  the change of sex  though it altered their future  did nothing whatever to alter their identity  their faces remained  as their portraits prove  practically the same  his memory  but in future we must  for convention own sake  say  her  for  his   and  ownhe  for  he   her memory then  went back through all the events of her past life without encountering any obstacle 
1176,some slight haziness there may have been  as if a few dark drops had fallen into the clear pool of memory  certain things had become a little dimmed  but that was all 
1177,the change seemed to have been accomplished painlessly and completely and in such a way that orlando herself showed no surprise at it 
1178,many people  taking this into account  and holding that such a change of sex is against nature  have been at great pains to prove     that orlando had always been a woman      that orlando is at this moment a man 
1179,let biologists and psychologists determine 
1180,it is enough for us to state the simple fact  orlando was a man till the age of thirty  when he became a woman and has remained so ever since 
1181,but let other pens treat of sex and sexuality  we quit such odious subjects as soon as we can 
1182,orlando had now washed  and dressed herself in those turkish coats and trousers which can be worn indifferently by either sex  and was forced to consider her position 
1183,that it was precarious and embarrassing in the extreme must be the first thought of every reader who has followed her story with sympathy 
1184,young  noble  beautiful  she had woken to find herself in a position than which we can conceive none more delicate for a young lady of rank 
1185,we should not have blamed her had she rung the bell  screamed  or fainted 
1186,but orlando showed no such signs of perturbation 
1187,all her actions were deliberate in the extreme  and might indeed have been thought to show tokens of premeditation 
1188,first  she carefully examined the papers on the table  took such as seemed to be written in poetry  and secreted them in her bosom  next she called her seleuchi hound  which had never left her bed all these days  though half famished with hunger  fed and combed him  then stuck a pair of pistols in her belt  finally wound about her person several strings of emeralds and pearls of the finest orient which had formed part of her ambassadorial wardrobe 
1189,this done  she leant out of the window  gave one low whistle  and descended the shattered and bloodstained staircase  now strewn with the litter of waste paper baskets  treaties  despatches  seals  sealing wax  etc   and so entered the courtyard 
1190,there  in the shadow of a giant fig tree  waited an old gipsy on a donkey 
1191,he led another by the bridle 
1192,orlando swung her leg over it  and thus  attended by a lean dog  riding a donkey  in company of a gipsy  the ambassador of great britain at the court of the sultan left constantinople 
1193,they rode for several days and nights and met with a variety of adventures  some at the hands of men  some at the hands of nature  in all of which orlando acquitted herself with courage 
1194,within a week they reached the high ground outside broussa  which was then the chief camping ground of the gipsy tribe to which orlando had allied herself 
1195,often she had looked at those mountains from her balcony at the embassy  often had longed to be there  and to find oneself where one has longed to be always  to a reflective mind  gives food for thought 
1196,for some time  however  she was too well pleased with the change to spoil it by thinking 
1197,the pleasure of having no documents to seal or sign  no flourishes to make  no calls to pay  was enough 
1198,the gipsies followed the grass  when it was grazed down  on they moved again 
1199,she washed in streams if she washed at all  no boxes  red  blue  or green  were presented to her  there was not a key  let alone a golden key  in the whole camp  as for  visiting   the word was unknown 
1200,she milked the goats  she collected brushwood  she stole a hen own egg now and then  but always put a coin or a pearl in place of it  she herded cattle  she stripped vines  she trod the grape  she filled the goat skin and drank from it  and when she remembered how  at about this time of day  she should have been making the motions of drinking and smoking over an empty coffee cup and a pipe which lacked tobacco  she laughed aloud  cut herself another hunch of bread  and begged for a puff from old rustum own pipe  filled though it was with cow dung 
1201,the gipsies  with whom it is obvious that she must have been in secret communication before the revolution  seem to have looked upon her as one of themselves  which is always the highest compliment a people can pay   and her dark hair and dark complexion bore out the belief that she was  by birth  one of them and had been snatched by an english duke from a nut tree when she was a baby and taken to that barbarous land where people live in houses because they are too feeble and diseased to stand the open air 
1202,thus  though in many ways inferior to them  they were willing to help her to become more like them  taught her their arts of cheese making and basket weaving  their science of stealing and bird snaring  and were even prepared to consider letting her marry among them 
1203,but orlando had contracted in england some of the customs or diseases  whatever you choose to consider them  which cannot  it seems  be expelled 
1204,one evening  when they were all sitting round the camp fire and the sunset was blazing over the thessalian hills  orlando exclaimed 
1205, how good to eat  
1206, the gipsies have no word for  beautiful   this is the nearest  
1207,all the young men and women burst out laughing uproariously 
1208,the sky good to eat  indeed 
1209,the elders  however  who had seen more of foreigners than they had  became suspicious 
1210,they noticed that orlando often sat for whole hours doing nothing whatever  except look here and then there  they would come upon her on some hill top staring straight in front of her  no matter whether the goats were grazing or straying 
1211,they began to suspect that she had other beliefs than their own  and the older men and women thought it probable that she had fallen into the clutches of the vilest and cruellest among all the gods  which is nature 
1212,nor were they far wrong 
1213,the english disease  a love of nature  was inborn in her  and here  where nature was so much larger and more powerful than in england  she fell into its hands as she had never done before 
1214,the malady is too well known  and has been  alas  too often described to need describing afresh  save very briefly 
1215,there were mountains  there were valleys  there were streams 
1216,she climbed the mountains  roamed the valleys  sat on the banks of the streams 
1217,she likened the hills to ramparts  to the breasts of doves  and the flanks of kine 
1218,she compared the flowers to enamel and the turf to turkey rugs worn thin 
1219,trees were withered hags  and sheep were grey boulders 
1220,everything  in fact  was something else 
1221,she found the tarn on the mountain top and almost threw herself in to seek the wisdom she thought lay hid there  and when  from the mountain top  she beheld far off  across the sea of marmara  the plains of greece  and made out  her eyes were admirable  the acropolis with a white streak or two  which must  she thought  be the parthenon  her soul expanded with her eyeballs  and she prayed that she might share the majesty of the hills  know the serenity of the plains  etc  etc   as all such believers do 
1222,then  looking down  the red hyacinth  the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy at the goodness  the beauty of nature  raising her eyes again  she beheld the eagle soaring  and imagined its raptures and made them her own 
1223,returning home  she saluted each star  each peak  and each watch fire as if they signalled to her alone  and at last  when she flung herself upon her mat in the gipsies  tent  she could not help bursting out again  how good to eat 
1224,how good to eat 
1225, for it is a curious fact that though human beings have such imperfect means of communication  that they can only say  good to eat  when they mean  beautiful  and the other way about  they will yet endure ridicule and misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to themselves  
1226,all the young gipsies laughed 
1227,but rustum el sadi  the old man who had brought orlando out of constantinople on his donkey  sat silent 
1228,he had a nose like a scimitar  his cheeks were furrowed as if from the age long descent of iron hail  he was brown and keen eyed  and as he sat tugging at his hookah he observed orlando narrowly 
1229,he had the deepest suspicion that her god was nature 
1230,one day he found her in tears 
1231,interpreting this to mean that her god had punished her  he told her that he was not surprised 
1232,he showed her the fingers of his left hand  withered by the frost  he showed her his right foot  crushed where a rock had fallen 
1233,this  he said  was what her god did to men 
1234,when she said   but so beautiful   using the english word  he shook his head  and when she repeated it he was angry 
1235,he saw that she did not believe what he believed  and that was enough  wise and ancient as he was  to enrage him 
1236,this difference of opinion disturbed orlando  who had been perfectly happy until now 
1237,she began to think  was nature beautiful or cruel  and then she asked herself what this beauty was  whether it was in things themselves  or only in herself  so she went on to the nature of reality  which led her to truth  which in its turn led to love  friendship  poetry  as in the days on the high mound at home   which meditations  since she could impart no word of them  made her long  as she had never longed before  for pen and ink 
1238, oh  if only i could write   she cried  for she had the odd conceit of those who write that words written are shared  
1239,she had no ink  and but little paper 
1240,but she made ink from berries and wine  and finding a few margins and blank spaces in the manuscript of  the oak tree   managed by writing a kind of shorthand  to describe the scenery in a long  blank verse poem  and to carry on a dialogue with herself about this beauty and truth concisely enough 
1241,this kept her extremely happy for hours on end 
1242,but the gipsies became suspicious 
1243,first  they noticed that she was less adept than before at milking and cheese making  next  she often hesitated before replying  and once a gipsy boy who had been asleep  woke in a terror feeling her eyes upon him 
1244,sometimes this constraint would be felt by the whole tribe  numbering some dozens of grown men and women 
1245,it sprang from the sense they had  and their senses are very sharp and much in advance of their vocabulary  that whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in their hands 
1246,an old woman making a basket  a boy skinning a sheep  would be singing or crooning contentedly at their work  when orlando would come into the camp  fling herself down by the fire and gaze into the flames 
1247,she need not even look at them  and yet they felt  here is someone who doubts   we make a rough and ready translation from the gipsy language  here is someone who does not do the thing for the sake of doing  nor looks for looking own sake  here is someone who believes neither in sheep skin nor basket  but sees  here they looked apprehensively about the tent  something else 
1248,then a vague but most unpleasant feeling would begin to work in the boy and in the old woman 
1249,they broke their withys  they cut their fingers 
1250,a great rage filled them 
1251,they wished orlando would leave the tent and never come near them again 
1252,yet she was of a cheerful and willing disposition  they owned  and one of her pearls was enough to buy the finest herd of goats in broussa 
1253,slowly  she began to feel that there was some difference between her and the gipsies which made her hesitate sometimes to marry and settle down among them for ever 
1254,at first she tried to account for it by saying that she came of an ancient and civilized race  whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people  not much better than savages 
1255,one night when they were questioning her about england she could not help with some pride describing the house where she was born  how it had bedrooms and had been in the possession of her family for four or five hundred years 
1256,her ancestors were earls  or even dukes  she added 
1257,at this she noticed again that the gipsies were uneasy  but not angry as before when she had praised the beauty of nature 
1258,now they were courteous  but concerned as people of fine breeding are when a stranger has been made to reveal his low birth or poverty 
1259,rustum followed her out of the tent alone and said that she need not mind if her father were a duke  and possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she described 
1260,they would none of them think the worse of her for that 
1261,then she was seized with a shame that she had never felt before 
1262,it was clear that rustum and the other gipsies thought a descent of four or five hundred years only the meanest possible 
1263,their own families went back at least two or three thousand years 
1264,to the gipsy whose ancestors had built the pyramids centuries before christ was born  the genealogy of howards and plantagenets was no better and no worse than that of the smiths and the joneses  both were negligible 
1265,moreover  where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such antiquity  there was nothing specially memorable or desirable in ancient birth  vagabonds and beggars all shared it 
1266,and then  though he was too courteous to speak openly  it was clear that the gipsy thought that there was no more vulgar ambition than to possess bedrooms by the hundred  they were on top of a hill as they spoke  it was night  the mountains rose around them  when the whole earth is ours 
1267,looked at from the gipsy point of view  a duke  orlando understood  was nothing but a profiteer or robber who snatched land and money from people who rated these things of little worth  and could think of nothing better to do than to build three hundred and sixty five bedrooms when one was enough  and none was even better than one 
1268,she could not deny that her ancestors had accumulated field after field  house after house  honour after honour  yet had none of them been saints or heroes  or great benefactors of the human race 
1269,nor could she counter the argument  rustum was too much of a gentleman to press it  but she understood  that any man who did now what her ancestors had done three or four hundred years ago would be denounced  and by her own family most loudly  for a vulgar upstart  an adventurer  a nouveau riche 
1270,she sought to answer such arguments by the familiar if oblique method of finding the gipsy life itself rude and barbarous  and so  in a short time  much bad blood was bred between them 
1271,indeed  such differences of opinion are enough to because bloodshed and revolution 
1272,towns have been sacked for less  and a million martyrs have suffered at the stake rather than yield an inch upon any of the points here debated 
1273,no passion is stronger in the breast of man than the desire to make others believe as he believes 
1274,nothing so cuts at the root of his happiness and fills him with rage as the sense that another rates low what he prizes high 
1275,whigs and tories  liberal party and labour party  for what do they battle except their own prestige  it is not love of truth but desire to prevail that sets quarter against quarter and makes parish desire the downfall of parish  each seeks peace of mind and subserviency rather than the triumph of truth and the exaltation of virtue  but these moralities belong  and should be left to the historian  since they are as dull as ditch water 
1276, four hundred and seventy six bedrooms mean nothing to them   sighed orlando 
1277, ownhe prefers a sunset to a flock of goats   said the gipsies 
1278,what was to be done  orlando could not think 
1279,to leave the gipsies and become once more an ambassador seemed to her intolerable 
1280,but it was equally impossible to remain for ever where there was neither ink nor writing paper  neither reverence for the talbots nor respect for a multiplicity of bedrooms 
1281,so she was thinking  one fine morning on the slopes of mount athos  when minding her goats 
1282,and then nature  in whom she trusted  either played her a trick or worked a miracle  again  opinions differ too much for it to be possible to say which 
1283,orlando was gazing rather disconsolately at the steep hill side in front of her 
1284,it was now midsummer  and if we must compare the landscape to anything  it would have been to a dry bone  to a sheep own skeleton  to a gigantic skull picked white by a thousand vultures 
1285,the heat was intense  and the little fig tree under which orlando lay only served to print patterns of fig leaves upon her light burnous 
1286,suddenly a shadow  though there was nothing to cast a shadow  appeared on the bald mountain side opposite 
1287,it deepened quickly and soon a green hollow showed where there had been barren rock before 
1288,as she looked  the hollow deepened and widened  and a great park like space opened in the flank of the hill 
1289,within  she could see an undulating and grassy lawn  she could see oak trees dotted here and there  she could see the thrushes hopping among the branches 
1290,she could see the deer stepping delicately from shade to shade  and could even hear the hum of insects and the gentle sighs and shivers of a summer own day in england 
1291,after she had gazed entranced for some time  snow began falling  soon the whole landscape was covered and marked with violet shades instead of yellow sunlight 
1292,now she saw heavy carts coming along the roads  laden with tree trunks  which they were taking  she knew  to be sawn for firewood  and then appeared the roofs and belfries and towers and courtyards of her own home 
1293,the snow was falling steadily  and she could now hear the slither and flop which it made as it slid down the roof and fell to the ground 
1294,the smoke went up from a thousand chimneys 
1295,all was so clear and minute that she could see a daw pecking for worms in the snow 
1296,then  gradually  the violet shadows deepened and closed over the carts and the lawns and the great house itself 
1297,all was swallowed up 
1298,now there was nothing left of the grassy hollow  and instead of the green lawns was only the blazing hill side which a thousand vultures seemed to have picked bare 
1299,at this  she burst into a passion of tears  and striding back to the gipsies  camp  told them that she must sail for england the very next day 
1300,it was happy for her that she did so 
1301,already the young men had plotted her death 
1302,honour  they said  demanded it  for she did not think as they did 
1303,yet they would have been sorry to cut her throat  and welcomed the news of her departure 
1304,an english merchant ship  as luck would have it  was already under sail in the harbour about to return to england  and orlando  by breaking off another pearl from her necklace  not only paid her passage but had some banknotes left over in her wallet 
1305,these she would have liked to present to the gipsies 
1306,but they despised wealth she knew  and she had to content herself with embraces  which on her part were sincere 
1307,with some of the guineas left from the sale of the tenth pearl on her string  orlando bought herself a complete outfit of such clothes as women then wore  and it was in the dress of a young englishwoman of rank that she now sat on the deck of the  enamoured lady  
1308,it is a strange fact  but a true one  that up to this moment she had scarcely given her sex a thought 
1309,perhaps the turkish trousers which she had hitherto worn had done something to distract her thoughts  and the gipsy women  except in one or two important particulars  differ very little from the gipsy men 
1310,at any rate  it was not until she felt the coil of skirts about her legs and the captain offered  with the greatest politeness  to have an awning spread for her on deck  that she realized with a start the penalties and the privileges of her position 
1311,but that start was not of the kind that might have been expected 
1312,it was not caused  that is to say  simply and solely by the thought of her chastity and how she could preserve it 
1313,in normal circumstances a lovely young woman alone would have thought of nothing else  the whole edifice of female government is based on that foundation stone  chastity is their jewel  their centrepiece  which they run mad to protect  and die when ravished of 
1314,but if one has been a man for thirty years or so  and an ambassador into the bargain  if one has held a queen in one own arms and one or two other ladies  if report be true  of less exalted rank  if one has married a rosina pepita  and so on  one does not perhaps give such a very great start about that 
1315,orlando own start was of a very complicated kind  and not to be summed up in a trice 
1316,nobody  indeed  ever accused her of being one of those quick wits who run to the end of things in a minute 
1317,it took her the entire length of the voyage to moralize out the meaning of her start  and so  at her own pace  we will follow her 
1318, lord   she thought  when she had recovered from her start  stretching herself out at length under her awning   this is a pleasant  lazy way of life  to be sure  but   she thought  giving her legs a kick   these skirts are plaguey things to have about one own heels  yet the stuff  flowered paduasoy  is the loveliest in the world  never have i seen my own skin  here she laid her hand on her knee  look to such advantage as now  could i  however  leap overboard and swim in clothes like these  no  therefore  i should have to trust to the protection of a blue jacket  do i object to that  now do i   she wondered  here encountering the first knot in the smooth skein of her argument 
1319,dinner came before she had untied it  and then it was the captain himself  captain nicholas benedict bartolus  a sea captain of distinguished aspect  who did it for her as he helped her to a slice of corned beef 
1320, a little of the fat  ma m   he asked 
1321, let me cut you just the tiniest little slice the size of your fingernail  
1322,at those words a delicious tremor ran through her frame 
1323,birds sang  the torrents rushed 
1324,it recalled the feeling of indescribable pleasure with which she had first seen sasha  hundreds of years ago 
1325,then she had pursued  now she fled 
1326,which is the greater ecstasy 
1327,the man own or the woman own 
1328,and are they not perhaps the same 
1329,no  she thought  this is the most delicious  thanking the captain but refusing   to refuse  and see him frown 
1330,well  she would  if he wished it  have the very thinnest  smallest shiver in the world 
1331,this was the most delicious of all  to yield and see him smile 
1332, for nothing   she thought  regaining her couch on deck  and continuing the argument   is more heavenly than to resist and to yield  to yield and to resist  surely it throws the spirit into such a rapture as nothing else can  so that I am not sure   she continued   that i will not throw myself overboard  for the mere pleasure of being rescued by a blue jacket after all  
1333, it must be remembered that she was like a child entering into possession of a pleasaunce or toy cupboard  her arguments would not commend themselves to mature women  who have had the run of it all their lives  
1334, but what used we young fellows in the cockpit of the  marie rose  to say about a woman who threw herself overboard for the pleasure of being rescued by a blue jacket   she said 
1335, we had a word for them  ah  i have it      but we must omit that word  it was disrespectful in the extreme and passing strange on a lady own lips    lord  lord  she cried again at the conclusion of her thoughts   must i then begin to respect the opinion of the other sex  however monstrous i think it  if i wear skirts  if i cannot swim  if i have to be rescued by a blue jacket  by god   she cried   i must  
1336,upon which a gloom fell over her 
1337,candid by nature  and averse to all kinds of equivocation  to tell lies bored her 
1338,it seemed to her a roundabout way of going to work 
1339,yet  she reflected  the flowered paduasoy  the pleasure of being rescued by a blue jacket  if these were only to be obtained by roundabout ways  roundabout one must go  she supposed 
1340,she remembered how  as a young man  she had insisted that women must be obedient  chaste  scented  and exquisitely apparelled 
1341, now i shall have to pay in my own person for those desires   she reflected   for women are not  judging by my own short experience of the sex  obedient  chaste  scented  and exquisitely apparelled by nature  they can only attain these graces  without which they may enjoy none of the delights of life  by the most tedious discipline  there is the hairdressing   she thought   that alone will take an hour of my morning  there is looking in the looking glass  another hour  there is staying and lacing  there is washing and powdering  there is changing from silk to lace and from lace to paduasoy  there is being chaste year in year out    
1342,here she tossed her foot impatiently  and showed an inch or two of calf 
1343,a sailor on the mast  who happened to look down at the moment  started so violently that he missed his footing and only saved himself by the skin of his teeth 
1344, if the sight of my ankles means death to an honest fellow who  no doubt  has a wife and family to support  i must  in all humanity  keep them covered   orlando thought 
1345,yet her legs were among her chiefest beauties 
1346,and she fell to thinking what an odd pass we have come to when all a woman own beauty has to be kept covered lest a sailor may fall from a mast head 
1347, a pox on them   she said  realizing for the first time what  in other circumstances  she would have been taught as a child  that is to say  the sacred responsibilities of womanhood 
1348, and that is the last oath i shall ever be able to swear   she thought   once i set foot on english soil  and i shall never be able to crack a man over the head  or tell him he lies in his teeth  or draw my sword and run him through the body  or sit among my peers  or wear a coronet  or walk in procession  or sentence a man to death  or lead an army  or prance down whitehall on a charger  or wear seventy two different medals on my breast  all i can do  once i set foot on english soil  is to pour out tea and ask my lords how they like it  d you take sugar  d you take cream  
1349,and mincing out the words  she was horrified to perceive how low an opinion she was forming of the other sex  the manly  to which it had once been her pride to belong   to fall from a mast head   she thought   because you see a woman own ankles  to dress up like a guy fawkes and parade the streets  so that women may praise you  to deny a woman teaching lest she may laugh at you  to be the slave of the frailest chit in petticoats  and yet to go about as if you were the lords of creation   heavens   she thought   what fools they make of us  what fools we are  
1350,and here it would seem from some ambiguity in her terms that she was censuring both sexes equally  as if she belonged to neither  and indeed  for the time being  she seemed to vacillate  she was man  she was woman  she knew the secrets  shared the weaknesses of each 
1351,it was a most bewildering and whirligig state of mind to be in 
1352,the comforts of ignorance seemed utterly denied her 
1353,she was a feather blown on the gale 
1354,thus it is no great wonder  as she pitted one sex against the other  and found each alternately full of the most deplorable infirmities  and was not sure to which she belonged  it was no great wonder that she was about to cry out that she would return to turkey and become a gipsy again when the anchor fell with a great splash into the sea  the sails came tumbling on deck  and she perceived  so sunk had she been in thought that she had seen nothing for several days  that the ship was anchored off the coast of italy 
1355,the captain at once sent to ask the honour of her company ashore with him in the longboat 
1356,when she returned the next morning  she stretched herself on her couch under the awning and arranged her draperies with the greatest decorum about her ankles 
1357, ignorant and poor as we are compared with the other sex   she thought  continuing the sentence which she had left unfinished the other day   armoured with every weapon as they are  while they debar us even from a knowledge of the alphabet   and from these opening words it is plain that something had happened during the night to give her a push towards the female sex  for she was speaking more as a woman speaks than as a man  yet with a sort of content after all    owntill  they fall from the mast head  
1358,here she gave a great yawn and fell asleep 
1359,when she woke  the ship was sailing before a fair breeze so near the shore that towns on the cliffs  edge seemed only kept from slipping into the water by the interposition of some great rock or the twisted roots of some ancient olive tree 
1360,the scent of oranges wafted from a million trees  heavy with the fruit  reached her on deck 
1361,a score of blue dolphins  twisting their tails  leapt high now and again into the air 
1362,stretching her arms out  arms  she had learnt already  have no such fatal effects as legs   she thanked heaven that she was not prancing down whitehall on a warhorse  nor even sentencing a man to death 
1363, better is it   she thought   to be clothed with poverty and ignorance  which are the dark garments of the female sex  better to leave the rule and discipline of the world to others  better be quit of martial ambition  the love of power  and all the other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the humane spirit  which are   she said aloud  as her habit was when deeply moved   contemplation  solitude  love  
1364, praise god that I am a woman   she cried  and was about to run into extreme folly  than which none is more distressing in woman or man either  of being proud of her sex  when she paused over the singular word  which  for all we can do to put it in its place  has crept in at the end of the last sentence  love 
1365, love   said orlando 
1366,instantly  such is its impetuosity  love took a human shape  such is its pride 
1367,for where other thoughts are content to remain abstract  nothing will satisfy this one but to put on flesh and blood  mantilla and petticoats  hose and jerkin 
1368,and as all orlando own loves had been women  now  through the culpable laggardry of the human frame to adapt itself to convention  though she herself was a woman  it was still a woman she loved  and if the consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all  it was to quicken and deepen those feelings which she had had as a man 
1369,for now a thousand hints and mysteries became plain to her that were then dark 
1370,now  the obscurity  which divides the sexes and let us linger innumerable impurities in its gloom  was removed  and if there is anything in what the poet says about truth and beauty  this affection gained in beauty what it lost in falsity 
1371,at last  she cried  she knew sasha as she was  and in the ardour of this discovery  and in the pursuit of all those treasures which were now revealed  she was so rapt and enchanted that it was as if a cannon ball had exploded at her ear when a man own voice said   permit me  madam   a man own hand raised her to her feet  and the fingers of a man with a three masted sailing ship tattooed on the middle finger pointed to the horizon 
1372, the cliffs of england  madam   said the captain  and he raised the hand which had pointed at the sky to the salute 
1373,orlando now gave a second start  even more violent than the first 
1374, christ jesus   she cried 
1375,happily  the sight of her native land after long absence excused both start and exclamation  or she would have been hard put to it to explain to captain bartolus the raging and conflicting emotions which now boiled within her 
1376,how tell him that she  who now trembled on his arm  had been a duke and an ambassador 
1377,how explain to him that she  who had been lapped like a lily in folds of paduasoy  had hacked heads off  and lain with loose women among treasure sacks in the holds of pirate ships on summer nights when the tulips were abloom and the bees buzzing off wapping old stairs 
1378,not even to herself could she explain the giant start she gave  as the resolute right hand of the sea captain indicated the cliffs of the british islands 
1379, to refuse and to yield   she murmured   how delightful  to pursue and conquer  how august  to perceive and to reason  how sublime  
1380,not one of these words so coupled together seemed to her wrong  nevertheless  as the chalky cliffs loomed nearer  she felt culpable  dishonoured  unchaste  which  for one who had never given the matter a thought  was strange 
1381,closer and closer they drew  till the samphire gatherers  hanging half way down the cliff  were plain to the naked eye 
1382,and watching them  she felt  scampering up and down within her  like some derisive ghost who in another instant will pick up her skirts and flaunt out of sight  sasha the lost  sasha the memory  whose reality she had proved just now so surprisingly  sasha  she felt  mopping and mowing and making all sorts of disrespectful gestures towards the cliffs and the samphire gatherers  and when the sailors began chanting   owno good bye and adieu to you  ladies of spain   the words echoed in orlando own sad heart  and she felt that however much landing there meant comfort  meant opulence  meant consequence and state  for she would doubtless pick up some noble prince and reign  his consort  over half yorkshire   still  if it meant conventionality  meant slavery  meant deceit  meant denying her love  fettering her limbs  pursing her lips  and restraining her tongue  then she would turn about with the ship and set sail once more for the gipsies 
1383,among the hurry of these thoughts  however  there now rose  like a dome of smooth  white marble  something which  whether fact or fancy  was so impressive to her fevered imagination that she settled upon it as one has seen a swarm of vibrant dragonflies alight  with apparent satisfaction  upon the glass bell which shelters some tender vegetable 
1384,the form of it  by the hazard of fancy  recalled that earliest  most persistent memory  the man with the big forehead in twitchett own sitting room  the man who sat writing  or rather looking  but certainly not at her  for he never seemed to see her poised there in all her finery  lovely boy though she must have been  she could not deny it  and whenever she thought of him  the thought spread round it  like the risen moon on turbulent waters  a sheet of silver calm 
1385,now her hand went to her bosom  the other was still in the captain own keeping   where the pages of her poem were hidden safe 
1386,it might have been a talisman that she kept there 
1387,the distraction of sex  which hers was  and what it meant  subsided  she thought now only of the glory of poetry  and the great lines of marlowe  shakespeare  ben jonson  milton began booming and reverberating  as if a golden clapper beat against a golden bell in the cathedral tower which was her mind 
1388,the truth was that the image of the marble dome which her eyes had first discovered so faintly that it suggested a poet own forehead and thus started a flock of irrelevant ideas  was no figment  but a reality  and as the ship advanced down the thames before a favouring gale  the image with all its associations gave place to the truth  and revealed itself as nothing more and nothing less than the dome of a vast cathedral rising among a fretwork of white spires 
1389, ownt paul own   said captain bartolus  who stood by her side 
1390, the tower of london   he continued 
1391, greenwich hospital  erected in memory of queen mary by her husband  his late majesty  william the third  westminster abbey  the houses of parliament  
1392,as he spoke  each of these famous buildings rose to view 
1393,it was a fine september morning 
1394,a myriad of little water craft plied from bank to bank 
1395,rarely has a gayer  or more interesting  spectacle presented itself to the gaze of a returned traveller 
1396,orlando hung over the prow  absorbed in wonder 
1397,her eyes had been used too long to savages and nature not to be entranced by these urban glories 
1398,that  then  was the dome of st paul own which mr wren had built during her absence 
1399,near by  a shock of golden hair burst from a pillar  captain bartolus was at her side to inform her that that was the monument  there had been a plague and a fire during her absence  he said 
1400,do what she could to restrain them  the tears came to her eyes  until  remembering that it is becoming in a woman to weep  she let them flow 
1401,here  she thought  had been the great carnival 
1402,here  where the waves slapped briskly  had stood the royal pavilion 
1403,here she had first met sasha 
1404,about here  she looked down into the sparkling waters  one had been used to see the frozen bumboat woman with her apples on her lap 
1405,all that splendour and corruption was gone 
1406,gone  too  was the dark night  the monstrous downpour  the violent surges of the flood 
1407,here  where yellow icebergs had raced circling with a crew of terror stricken wretches on top  a covey of swans floated  orgulous  undulant  superb 
1408,london itself had completely changed since she had last seen it 
1409,then  she remembered  it had been a huddle of little black  beetle browed houses 
1410,the heads of rebels had grinned on pikes at temple bar 
1411,the cobbled pavements had reeked of garbage and ordure 
1412,now  as the ship sailed past wapping  she caught glimpses of broad and orderly thoroughfares 
1413,stately coaches drawn by teams of well fed horses stood at the doors of houses whose bow windows  whose plate glass  whose polished knockers  testified to the wealth and modest dignity of the dwellers within 
1414,ladies in flowered silk  she put the captain own glass to her eye  walked on raised footpaths 
1415,citizens in broidered coats took snuff at street corners under lamp posts 
1416,she caught sight of a variety of painted signs swinging in the breeze and could form a rapid notion from what was painted on them of the tobacco  of the stuff  of the silk  of the gold  of the silver ware  of the gloves  of the perfumes  and of a thousand other articles which were sold within 
1417,nor could she do more as the ship sailed to its anchorage by london bridge than glance at coffee house windows where  on balconies  since the weather was fine  a great number of decent citizens sat at ease  with china dishes in front of them  clay pipes by their sides  while one among them read from a news sheet  and was frequently interrupted by the laughter or the comments of the others 
1418,were these taverns  were these wits  were these poets 
1419,she asked of captain bartolus  who obligingly informed her that even now  if she turned her head a little to the left and looked along the line of his first finger  so  they were passing the cocoa tree  where   yes  there he was  one might see mr addison taking his coffee  the other two gentlemen   there  madam  a little to the right of the lamp post  one of  them humped  t other much the same as you or me   were mr dryden and mr pope 
1420,   ownad dogs   said the captain  by which he meant that they were papists   but men of parts  none the less   he added  hurrying aft to superintend the arrangements for landing 
1421, the captain must have been mistaken  as a reference to any textbook of literature will show  but the mistake was a kindly one  and so we let it stand  
1422, addison  dryden  pope   orlando repeated as if the words were an incantation 
1423,for one moment she saw the high mountains above broussa  the next  she had set her foot upon her native shore 
1424,but now orlando was to learn how little the most tempestuous flutter of excitement avails against the iron countenance of the law  how harder than the stones of london bridge it is  and than the lips of a cannon more severe 
1425,no sooner had she returned to her home in blackfriars than she was made aware by a succession of bow street runners and other grave emissaries from the law courts that she was a party to three major suits which had been preferred against her during her absence  as well as innumerable minor litigations  some arising out of  others depending on them 
1426,the chief charges against her were     that she was dead  and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever      that she was a woman  which amounts to much the same thing      that she was an english duke who had married one rosina pepita  a dancer  and had had by her three sons  which sons now declaring that their father was deceased  claimed that all his property descended to them 
1427,such grave charges as these would  of course  take time and money to dispose of 
1428,all her estates were put in chancery and her titles pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation 
1429,thus it was in a highly ambiguous condition  uncertain whether she was alive or dead  man or woman  duke or nonentity  that she posted down to her country seat  where  pending the legal judgment  she had the law own permission to reside in a state of incognito or incognita  as the case might turn out to be 
1430,it was a fine evening in december when she arrived and the snow was falling and the violet shadows were slanting much as she had seen them from the hill top at broussa 
1431,the great house lay more like a town than a house  brown and blue  rose and purple in the snow  with all its chimneys smoking busily as if inspired with a life of their own 
1432,she could not restrain a cry as she saw it there tranquil and massive  couched upon the meadows 
1433,as the yellow coach entered the park and came bowling along the drive between the trees  the red deer raised their heads as if expectantly  and it was observed that instead of showing the timidity natural to their kind  they followed the coach and stood about the courtyard when it drew up 
1434,some tossed their antlers  others pawed the ground as the step was let down and orlando alighted 
1435,one  it is said  actually knelt in the snow before her 
1436,she had not time to reach her hand towards the knocker before both wings of the great door were flung open  and there  with lights and torches held above their heads  were mrs grimsditch  mr dupper  and a whole retinue of servants come to greet her 
1437,but the orderly procession was interrupted first by the impetuosity of canute  the elk hound  who threw himself with such ardour upon his mistress that he almost knocked her to the ground  next  by the agitation of mrs grimsditch  who  making as if to curtsey  was overcome with emotion and could do no more than gasp milord 
1438,milady 
1439,milady 
1440,milord  until orlando comforted her with a hearty kiss upon both her cheeks 
1441,after that  mr dupper began to read from a parchment  but the dogs barking  the huntsmen winding their horns  and the stags  who had come into the courtyard in the confusion  baying the moon  not much progress was made  and the company dispersed within after crowding about their mistress  and testifying in every way to their great joy at her return 
1442,no one showed an instant own suspicion that orlando was not the orlando they had known 
1443,if any doubt there was in the human mind the action of the deer and the dogs would have been enough to dispel it  for the dumb creatures  as is well known  are far better judges both of identity and character than we are 
1444,moreover  said mrs grimsditch  over her dish of china tea  to mr dupper that night  if her lord was a lady now  she had never seen a lovelier one  nor was there a penny piece to choose between them  one was as well favoured as the other  they were as like as two peaches on one branch  which  said mrs grimsditch  becoming confidential  she had always had her suspicions  here she nodded her head very mysteriously   which it was no surprise to her  here she nodded her head very knowingly   and for her part  a very great comfort  for what with the towels wanting mending and the curtains in the chaplain own parlour being moth eaten round the fringes  it was time they had a mistress among them 
1445, and some little masters and mistresses to come after her   mr dupper added  being privileged by virtue of his holy office to speak his mind on such delicate matters as these 
1446,so  while the old servants gossiped in the servants  hall  orlando took a silver candle in her hand and roamed once more through the halls  the galleries  the courts  the bedrooms  saw loom down at her again the dark visage of this lord keeper  that lord chamberlain  among her ancestors  sat now in this chair of state  now reclined on that canopy of delight  observed the arras  how it swayed  watched the huntsmen riding and daphne flying  bathed her hand  as she had loved to do as a child  in the yellow pool of light which the moonlight made falling through the heraldic leopard in the window  slid along the polished planks of the gallery  the other side of which was rough timber  touched this silk  that satin  fancied the carved dolphins swam  brushed her hair with king james  silver brush  buried her face in the potpourri  which was made as the conqueror had taught them many hundred years ago and from the same roses  looked at the garden and imagined the sleeping crocuses  the dormant dahlias  saw the frail nymphs gleaming white in the snow and the great yew hedges  thick as a house  black behind them  saw the orangeries and the giant medlars   all this she saw  and each sight and sound  rudely as we write it down  filled her heart with such a lust and balm of joy  that at length  tired out  she entered the chapel and sank into the old red arm chair in which her ancestors used to hear service 
1447,there she lit a cheroot  it was a habit she had brought back from the east  and opened the prayer book 
1448,it was a little book bound in velvet  stitched with gold  which had been held by mary queen of scots on the scaffold  and the eye of faith could detect a brownish stain  said to be made of a drop of the royal blood 
1449,but what pious thoughts it roused in orlando  what evil passions it soothed asleep  who dare say  seeing that of all communions this with the deity is the most inscrutable 
1450,novelist  poet  historian all falter with their hand on that door  nor does the believer himself enlighten us  for is he more ready to die than other people  or more eager to share his goods 
1451,does he not keep as many maids and carriage horses as the rest 
1452,and yet with it all  holds a faith he says which should make goods a vanity and death desirable 
1453,in the queen own prayerbook  along with the blood stain  was also a lock of hair and a crumb of pastry  orlando now added to these keepsakes a flake of tobacco  and so  reading and smoking  was moved by the humane jumble of them all  the hair  the pastry  the blood stain  the tobacco  to such a mood of contemplation as gave her a reverent air suitable in the circumstances  though she had  it is said  no traffic with the usual god 
1454,nothing  however  can be more arrogant  though nothing is commoner than to assume that of gods there is only one  and of religions none but the speaker own 
1455,orlando  it seemed  had a faith of her own 
1456,with all the religious ardour in the world  she now reflected upon her sins and the imperfections that had crept into her spiritual state 
1457,the letter s  she reflected  is the serpent in the poet own eden 
1458,do what she would there were still too many of these sinful reptiles in the first stanzas of  the oak tree  
1459,but  own  was nothing  in her opinion  compared with the termination  ing  
1460,the present participle is the devil himself  she thought  now that we are in the place for believing in devils 
1461,to evade such temptations is the first duty of the poet  she concluded  for as the ear is the antechamber to the soul  poetry can adulterate and destroy more surely than lust or gunpowder 
1462,the poet own  then  is the highest office of all  she continued 
1463,his words reach where others fall short 
1464,a silly song of shakespeare own has done more for the poor and the wicked than all the preachers and philanthropists in the world 
1465,no time  no devotion  can be too great  therefore  which makes the vehicle of our message less distorting 
1466,we must shape our words till they are the thinnest integument for our thoughts 
1467,thoughts are divine  etc 
1468,thus it is obvious that she was back in the confines of her own religion which time had only strengthened in her absence  and was rapidly acquiring the intolerance of belief 
1469, i am growing up   she thought  taking her taper at last 
1470, i am losing some illusions   she said  shutting queen mary own book   perhaps to acquire others   and she descended among the tombs where the bones of her ancestors lay 
1471,but even the bones of her ancestors  sir miles  sir gervase  and the rest  had lost something of their sanctity since rustum el sadi had waved his hand that night in the asian mountains 
1472,somehow the fact that only three or four hundred years ago these skeletons had been men with their way to make in the world like any modern upstart  and that they had made it by acquiring houses and offices  garters and ribbands  as any other upstart does  while poets  perhaps  and men of great mind and breeding had preferred the quietude of the country  for which choice they paid the penalty by extreme poverty  and now hawked broadsheets in the strand  or herded sheep in the fields  filled her with remorse 
1473,she thought of the egyptian pyramids and what bones lie beneath them as she stood in the crypt  and the vast  empty hills which lie above the sea of marmara seemed  for the moment  a finer dwelling place than this many roomed mansion in which no bed lacked its quilt and no silver dish its silver cover 
1474, i am growing up   she thought  taking her taper 
1475, i am losing my illusions  perhaps to acquire new ones   and she paced down the long gallery to her bedroom 
1476,it was a disagreeable process  and a troublesome 
1477,but it was interesting  amazingly  she thought  stretching her legs out to her log fire  for no sailor was present   and she reviewed  as if it were an avenue of great edifices  the progress of her own self along her own past 
1478,how she had loved sound when she was a boy  and thought the volley of tumultuous syllables from the lips the finest of all poetry 
1479,then  it was the effect of sasha and her disillusionment perhaps  into this high frenzy was let fall some black drop  which turned her rhapsody into sluggishness 
1480,slowly there had opened within her something intricate and many chambered  which one must take a torch to explore  in prose not verse  and she remembered how passionately she had studied that doctor at norwich  browne  whose book was at her hand there 
1481,she had formed here in solitude after her affair with greene  or tried to form  for heaven knows these growths are agelong in coming  a spirit capable of resistance 
1482, i will write   she had said   what i enjoy writing   and so had scratched out twenty six volumes 
1483,yet still  for all her travels and adventures and profound thinkings and turnings this way and that  she was only in process of fabrication 
1484,what the future might bring  heaven only knew 
1485,change was incessant  and change perhaps would never cease 
1486,high battlements of thought  habits that had seemed durable as stone  went down like shadows at the touch of another mind and left a naked sky and fresh stars twinkling in it 
1487,here she went to the window  and in spite of the cold could not help unlatching it 
1488,she leant out into the damp night air 
1489,she heard a fox bark in the woods  and the clutter of a pheasant trailing through the branches 
1490,she heard the snow slither and flop from the roof to the ground 
1491, by my life   she exclaimed   this is a thousand times better than turkey  rustum   she cried  as if she were arguing with the gipsy  and in this new power of bearing an argument in mind and continuing it with someone who was not there to contradict she showed again the development of her soul    you were wrong  this is better than turkey  hair  pastry  tobacco  of what odds and ends are we compounded   she said  thinking of queen mary own prayer book  
1492, what a phantasmagoria the mind is and meeting place of dissemblables  at one moment we deplore our birth and state and aspire to an ascetic exaltation  the next we are overcome by the smell of some old garden path and weep to hear the thrushes sing  
1493,and so bewildered as usual by the multitude of things which call for explanation and imprint their message without leaving any hint as to their meaning  she threw her cheroot out of the window and went to bed 
1494,next morning  in pursuance of these thoughts  she had out her pen and paper 
1495,and started afresh upon  the oak tree   for to have ink and paper in plenty when one has made do with berries and margins is a delight not to be conceived 
1496,thus she was now striking out a phrase in the depths of despair  now in the heights of ecstasy writing one in  when a shadow darkened the page 
1497,she hastily hid her manuscript 
1498,as her window gave on to the most central of the courts  as she had given orders that she would see no one  as she knew no one and was herself legally unknown  she was first surprised at the shadow  then indignant at it  then  when she looked up and saw what caused it  overcome with merriment 
1499,for it was a familiar shadow  a grotesque shadow  the shadow of no less a personage than the archduchess harriet griselda of finster aarhorn and scand op boom in the roumanian territory 
1500,she was loping across the court in her old black riding habit and mantle as before 
1501,not a hair of her head was changed 
1502,this then was the woman who had chased her from england 
1503,this was the eyrie of that obscene vulture  this the fatal fowl herself 
1504,at the thought that she had fled all the way to turkey to avoid her seductions  now become excessively flat   orlando laughed aloud 
1505,there was something inexpressibly comic in the sight 
1506,she resembled  as orlando had thought before  nothing so much as a monstrous hare 
1507,she had the staring eyes  the lank cheeks  the high headdress of that animal 
1508,she stopped now  much as a hare sits erect in the corn when thinking itself unobserved  and stared at orlando  who stared back at her from the window 
1509,after they had stared like this for a certain time  there was nothing for it but to ask her in  and soon the two ladies were exchanging compliments while the archduchess struck the snow from her mantle 
1510, a plague on women   said orlando to herself  going to the cupboard to fetch a glass of wine   they never leave one a moment own peace  a more ferreting  inquisiting  busybodying set of people do not exist  it was to escape this maypole that i left england  and now   here she turned to present the archduchess with the salver  and behold  in her place stood a tall gentleman in black 
1511,a heap of clothes lay in the fender 
1512,she was alone with a man 
1513,recalled thus suddenly to a consciousness of her sex  which she had completely forgotten  and of his  which was now remote enough to be equally upsetting  orlando felt seized with faintness 
1514, la   she cried  putting her hand to her side   how you frighten me  
1515, gentle creature   cried the archduchess  falling on one knee and at the same time pressing a cordial to orlando own lips   forgive me for the deceit i have practised on you  
1516,orlando sipped the wine and the archduke knelt and kissed her hand 
1517,in short  they acted the parts of man and woman for ten minutes with great vigour and then fell into natural discourse 
1518,the archduchess  but she must in future be known as the archduke  told his story  that he was a man and always had been one  that he had seen a portrait of orlando and fallen hopelessly in love with him  that to compass his ends  he had dressed as a woman and lodged at the baker own shop  that he was desolated when he fled to turkey  that he had heard of her change and hastened to offer his services  here he teed and heed intolerably  
1519,for to him  said the archduke harry  she was and would ever be the pink  the pearl  the perfection of her sex 
1520,the three p own would have been more persuasive if they had not been interspersed with tee hees and haw haws of the strangest kind 
1521, if this is love   said orlando to herself  looking at the archduke on the other side of the fender  and now from the woman own point of view   there is something highly ridiculous about it  
1522,falling on his knees  the archduke harry made the most passionate declaration of his suit 
1523,he told her that he had something like twenty million ducats in a strong box at his castle 
1524,he had more acres than any nobleman in england 
1525,the shooting was excellent  he could promise her a mixed bag of ptarmigan and grouse such as no english moor  or scotch either  could rival 
1526,true  the pheasants had suffered from the gape in his absence  and the does had slipped their young  but that could be put right  and would be with her help when they lived in roumania together 
1527,as he spoke  enormous tears formed in his rather prominent eyes and ran down the sandy tracts of his long and lanky cheeks 
1528,that men cry as frequently and as unreasonably as women  orlando knew from her own experience as a man  but she was beginning to be aware that women should be shocked when men display emotion in their presence  and so  shocked she was 
1529,the archduke apologized 
1530,he commanded himself sufficiently to say that he would leave her now  but would return on the following day for his answer 
1531,that was a tuesday 
1532,he came on wednesday  he came on thursday  he came on friday  and he came on saturday 
1533,it is true that each visit began  continued  or concluded with a declaration of love  but in between there was much room for silence 
1534,they sat on either side of the fireplace and sometimes the archduke knocked over the fire irons and orlando picked them up again 
1535,then the archduke would bethink him how he had shot an elk in sweden  and orlando would ask  was it a very big elk  and the archduke would say that it was not as big as the reindeer which he shot in norway  and orlando would ask  had he ever shot a tiger  and the archduke would say he had shot an albatross  and orlando would say  half hiding her yawn  was an albatross as big as an elephant  and the archduke would say  something very sensible  no doubt  but orlando heard it not  for she was looking at her writing table  out of the window  at the door 
1536,upon which the archduke would say   i adore you   at the very same moment that orlando said  look  it is beginning to rain   at which they were both much embarrassed  and blushed scarlet  and could neither of them think what to say next 
1537,indeed  orlando was at her wit own end what to talk about and had she not bethought her of a game called fly loo  at which great sums of money can be lost with very little expense of spirit  she would have had to marry him  she supposed  for how else to get rid of him she knew not 
1538,by this device  however  and it was a simple one  needing only three lumps of sugar and a sufficiency of flies  the embarrassment of conversation was overcome and the necessity of marriage avoided 
1539,for now  the archduke would bet her five hundred pounds to a tester that a fly would settle on this lump and not on that 
1540,thus  they would have occupation for a whole morning watching the flies  who were naturally sluggish at this season and often spent an hour or so circling round the ceiling  until at length some fine bluebottle made his choice and the match was won 
1541,many hundreds of pounds changed hands between them at this game  which the archduke  who was a born gambler  swore was every bit as good as horse racing  and vowed he could play at for ever 
1542,but orlando soon began to weary 
1543,what is the good of being a fine young woman in the prime of life   she asked   if i have to pass all my mornings watching blue bottles with an archduke  
1544,she began to detest the sight of sugar  flies made her dizzy 
1545,some way out of the difficulty there must be  she supposed  but she was still awkward in the arts of her sex  and as she could no longer knock a man over the head or run him through the body with a rapier  she could think of no better method than this 
1546,she caught a blue bottle  gently pressed the life out of it  it was half dead already  or her kindness for the dumb creatures would not have permitted it  and secured it by a drop of gum arabic to a lump of sugar 
1547,while the archduke was gazing at the ceiling  she deftly substituted this lump for the one she had laid her money on  and crying  loo loo   declared that she had won her bet 
1548,her reckoning was that the archduke  with all his knowledge of sport and horseracing  would detect the fraud and  as to cheat at loo is the most heinous of crimes  and men have been banished from the society of mankind to that of apes in the tropics for ever because of it  she calculated that he would be manly enough to refuse to have anything further to do with her 
1549,but she misjudged the simplicity of the amiable nobleman 
1550,he was no nice judge of flies 
1551,a dead fly looked to him much the same as a living one 
1552,she played the trick twenty times on him and he paid her over   pounds  which is about   pounds shillings and pence of our own money  before orlando cheated so grossly that even he could be deceived no longer 
1553,when he realized the truth at last  a painful scene ensued 
1554,the archduke rose to his full height 
1555,he coloured scarlet 
1556,tears rolled down his cheeks one by one 
1557,that she had won a fortune from him was nothing  she was welcome to it  that she had deceived him was something  it hurt him to think her capable of it  but that she had cheated at loo was everything 
1558,to love a woman who cheated at play was  he said  impossible 
1559,here he broke down completely 
1560,happily  he said  recovering slightly  there were no witnesses 
1561,she was  after all  only a woman  he said 
1562,in short  he was preparing in the chivalry of his heart to forgive her and had bent to ask her pardon for the violence of his language  when she cut the matter short  as he stooped his proud head  by dropping a small toad between his skin and his shirt 
1563,in justice to her  it must be said that she would infinitely have preferred a rapier 
1564,toads are clammy things to conceal about one own person a whole morning 
1565,but if rapiers are forbidden  one must have recourse to toads 
1566,moreover toads and laughter between them sometimes do what cold steel cannot 
1567,she laughed 
1568,the archduke blushed 
1569,she laughed 
1570,the archduke cursed 
1571,she laughed 
1572,the archduke slammed the door 
1573, heaven be praised   cried orlando still laughing 
1574,she heard the sound of chariot wheels driven at a furious pace down the courtyard 
1575,she heard them rattle along the road 
1576,fainter and fainter the sound became 
1577,now it faded away altogether 
1578, i am alone   said orlando  aloud since there was no one to hear 
1579,that silence is more profound after noise still wants the confirmation of science 
1580,but that loneliness is more apparent directly after one has been made love to  many women would take their oath 
1581,as the sound of the archduke own chariot wheels died away  orlando felt drawing further from her and further from her an archduke  she did not mind that   a fortune  she did not mind that   a title  she did not mind that   the safety and circumstance of married life  she did not mind that   but life she heard going from her  and a lover 
1582, life and a lover   she murmured  and going to her writing table she dipped her pen in the ink and wrote 
1583, life and a lover   a line which did not scan and made no sense with what went before  something about the proper way of dipping sheep to avoid the scab 
1584,reading it over she blushed and repeated 
1585, life and a lover  
1586,then laying her pen aside she went into her bedroom  stood in front of her mirror  and arranged her pearls about her neck 
1587,then since pearls do not show to advantage against a morning gown of sprigged cotton  she changed to a dove grey taffeta  thence to one of peach bloom  thence to a wine coloured brocade 
1588,perhaps a dash of powder was needed  and if her hair were disposed  so  about her brow  it might become her 
1589,then she slipped her feet into pointed slippers  and drew an emerald ring upon her finger 
1590, now   she said when all was ready and lit the silver sconces on either side of the mirror 
1591,what woman would not have kindled to see what orlando saw then burning in the snow  for all about the looking glass were snowy lawns  and she was like a fire  a burning bush  and the candle flames about her head were silver leaves  or again  the glass was green water  and she a mermaid  slung with pearls  a siren in a cave  singing so that oarsmen leant from their boats and fell down  down to embrace her  so dark  so bright  so hard  so soft  was she  so astonishingly seductive that it was a thousand pities that there was no one there to put it in plain english  and say outright   damn it  madam  you are loveliness incarnate   which was the truth 
1592,even orlando  who had no conceit of her person  knew it  for she smiled the involuntary smile which women smile when their own beauty  which seems not their own  forms like a drop falling or a fountain rising and confronts them all of a sudden in the glass  this smile she smiled and then she listened for a moment and heard only the leaves blowing and the sparrows twittering  and then she sighed   life  a lover   and then she turned on her heel with extraordinary rapidity  whipped her pearls from her neck  stripped the satins from her back  stood erect in the neat black silk knickerbockers of an ordinary nobleman  and rang the bell 
1593,when the servant came  she told him to order a coach and six to be in readiness instantly 
1594,she was summoned by urgent affairs to london 
1595,within an hour of the archduke own departure  off she drove 
1596,and as she drove  we may seize the opportunity  since the landscape was of a simple english kind which needs no description  to draw the reader own attention more particularly than we could at the moment to one or two remarks which have slipped in here and there in the course of the narrative 
1597,for example  it may have been observed that orlando hid her manuscripts when interrupted 
1598,next  that she looked long and intently in the glass  and now  as she drove to london  one might notice her starting and suppressing a cry when the horses galloped faster than she liked 
1599,her modesty as to her writing  her vanity as to her person  her fears for her safety all seems to hint that what was said a short time ago about there being no change in orlando the man and orlando the woman  was ceasing to be altogether true 
1600,she was becoming a little more modest  as women are  of her brains  and a little more vain  as women are  of her person 
1601,certain susceptibilities were asserting themselves  and others were diminishing 
1602,the change of clothes had  some philosophers will say  much to do with it 
1603,vain trifles as they seem  clothes have  they say  more important offices than merely to keep us warm 
1604,they change our view of the world and the world own view of us 
1605,for example  when captain bartolus saw orlando own skirt  he had an awning stretched for her immediately  pressed her to take another slice of beef  and invited her to go ashore with him in the long boat 
1606,these compliments would certainly not have been paid her had her skirts  instead of flowing  been cut tight to her legs in the fashion of breeches 
1607,and when we are paid compliments  it behoves us to make some return 
1608,orlando curtseyed  she complied  she flattered the good man own humours as she would not have done had his neat breeches been a woman own skirts  and his braided coat a woman own satin bodice 
1609,thus  there is much to support the view that it is clothes that wear us and not we them  we may make them take the mould of arm or breast  but they mould our hearts  our brains  our tongues to their liking 
1610,so  having now worn skirts for a considerable time  a certain change was visible in orlando  which is to be found if the reader will look at the above  even in her face 
1611,if we compare the picture of orlando as a man with that of orlando as a woman we shall see that though both are undoubtedly one and the same person  there are certain changes 
1612,the man has his hand free to seize his sword  the woman must use hers to keep the satins from slipping from her shoulders 
1613,the man looks the world full in the face  as if it were made for his uses and fashioned to his liking 
1614,the woman takes a sidelong glance at it  full of subtlety  even of suspicion 
1615,had they both worn the same clothes  it is possible that their outlook might have been the same 
1616,that is the view of some philosophers and wise ones  but on the whole  we incline to another 
1617,the difference between the sexes is  happily  one of great profundity 
1618,clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath 
1619,it was a change in orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman own dress and of a woman own sex 
1620,and perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual  openness indeed was the soul of her nature  something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed 
1621,for here again  we come to a dilemma 
1622,different though the sexes are  they intermix 
1623,in every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place  and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness  while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above 
1624,of the complications and confusions which thus result everyone has had experience  but here we leave the general question and note only the odd effect it had in the particular case of orlando herself 
1625,for it was this mixture in her of man and woman  one being uppermost and then the other  that often gave her conduct an unexpected turn 
1626,the curious of her own sex would argue  for example  if orlando was a woman  how did she never take more than ten minutes to dress 
1627,and were not her clothes chosen rather at random  and sometimes worn rather shabby 
1628,and then they would say  still  she has none of the formality of a man  or a man own love of power 
1629,she is excessively tender hearted 
1630,she could not endure to see a donkey beaten or a kitten drowned 
1631,yet again  they noted  she detested household matters  was up at dawn and out among the fields in summer before the sun had risen 
1632,no farmer knew more about the crops than she did 
1633,she could drink with the best and liked games of hazard 
1634,she rode well and drove six horses at a gallop over london bridge 
1635,yet again  though bold and active as a man  it was remarked that the sight of another in danger brought on the most womanly palpitations 
1636,she would burst into tears on slight provocation 
1637,she was unversed in geography  found mathematics intolerable  and held some caprices which are more common among women than men  as for instance that to travel south is to travel downhill 
1638,whether  then  orlando was most man or woman  it is difficult to say and cannot now be decided 
1639,for her coach was now rattling on the cobbles 
1640,she had reached her home in the city 
1641,the steps were being let down  the iron gates were being opened 
1642,she was entering her father own house at blackfriars  which though fashion was fast deserting that end of the town  was still a pleasant  roomy mansion  with gardens running down to the river  and a pleasant grove of nut trees to walk in 
1643,here she took up her lodging and began instantly to look about her for what she had come in search of  that is to say  life and a lover  about the first there might be some doubt  the second she found without the least difficulty two days after her arrival  it was a tuesday that she came to town  on thursday she went for a walk in the mall  as was then the habit of persons of quality  she had not made more than a turn or two of the avenue before she was observed by a little knot of vulgar people who go there to spy upon their betters  as she came past them  a common woman carrying a child at her breast stepped forward  peered familiarly into orlando own face  and cried out   lawk upon us  if it are not the lady orlando   her companions came crowding round  and orlando found herself in a moment the centre of a mob of staring citizens and tradesmen own wives  all eager to gaze upon the heroine of the celebrated lawsuit  such was the interest that the case excited in the minds of the common people  she might  indeed  have found herself gravely discommoded by the pressure of the crowd  she had forgotten that ladies are not supposed to walk in public places alone  had not a tall gentleman at once stepped forward and offered her the protection of his arm 
1644,it was the archduke 
1645,she was overcome with distress and yet with some amusement at the sight 
1646,not only had this magnanimous nobleman forgiven her  but in order to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part  he had procured a jewel made in the shape of that reptile which he pressed upon her with a repetition of his suit as he handed her to her coach 
1647,what with the crowd  what with the duke  what with the jewel  she drove home in the vilest temper imaginable 
1648,was it impossible then to go for a walk without being half suffocated  presented with a toad set in emeralds  and asked in marriage by an archduke 
1649,she took a kinder view of the case next day when she found on her breakfast table half a dozen billets from some of the greatest ladies in the land  lady suffolk  lady salisbury  lady chesterfield  lady tavistock  and others who reminded her in the politest manner of old alliances between their families and her own  and desired the honour of her acquaintance 
1650,next day  which was a saturday  many of these great ladies waited on her in person 
1651,on tuesday  about noon  their footmen brought cards of invitation to various routs  dinners  and assemblies in the near future  so that orlando was launched without delay  and with some splash and foam at that  upon the waters of london society 
1652,to give a truthful account of london society at that or indeed at any other time  is beyond the powers of the biographer or the historian 
1653,only those who have little need of the truth  and no respect for it  the poets and the novelists  can be trusted to do it  for this is one of the cases where the truth does not exist 
1654,nothing exists 
1655,the whole thing is a miasma  a mirage  to make our meaning plain  orlando could come home from one of these routs at three or four in the morning with cheeks like a christmas tree and eyes like stars 
1656,she would untie a lace  pace the room a score of times  untie another lace  stop  and pace the room again 
1657,often the sun would be blazing over southwark chimneys before she could persuade herself to get into bed  and there she would lie  pitching and tossing  laughing and sighing for an hour or longer before she slept at last 
1658,and what was all this stir about 
1659,society 
1660,and what had society said or done to throw a reasonable lady into such an excitement 
1661,in plain language  nothing 
1662,rack her memory as she would  next day orlando could never remember a single word to magnify into the name something 
1663,lord o  had been gallant 
1664,lord a  polite 
1665,the marquis of c  charming 
1666,mr m  amusing 
1667,but when she tried to recollect in what their gallantry  politeness  charm  or wit had consisted  she was bound to suppose her memory at fault  for she could not name a thing 
1668,it was the same always 
1669,nothing remained over the next day  yet the excitement of the moment was intense 
1670,thus we are forced to conclude that society is one of those brews such as skilled housekeepers serve hot about christmas time  whose flavour depends upon the proper mixing and stirring of a dozen different ingredients 
1671,take one out  and it is in itself insipid 
1672,take away lord o   lord a   lord c   or mr m  and separately each is nothing 
1673,stir them all together and they combine to give off the most intoxicating of flavours  the most seductive of scents 
1674,yet this intoxication  this seductiveness  entirely evade our analysis 
1675,at one and the same time  therefore  society is everything and society is nothing 
1676,society is the most powerful concoction in the world and society has no existence whatsoever 
1677,such monsters the poets and the novelists alone can deal with  with such something nothings their works are stuffed out to prodigious size  and to them with the best will in the world we are content to leave it 
1678,following the example of our predecessors  therefore  we will only say that society in the reign of queen anne was of unparalleled brilliance 
1679,to have the entry there was the aim of every well bred person 
1680,the graces were supreme 
1681,fathers instructed their sons  mothers their daughters 
1682,no education was complete for either sex which did not include the science of deportment  the art of bowing and curtseying  the management of the sword and the fan  the care of the teeth  the conduct of the leg  the flexibility of the knee  the proper methods of entering and leaving the room  with a thousand etceteras  such as will immediately suggest themselves to anybody who has himself been in society 
1683,since orlando had won the praise of queen elizabeth for the way she handed a bowl of rose water as a boy  it must be supposed that she was sufficiently expert to pass muster 
1684,yet it is true that there was an absentmindedness about her which sometimes made her clumsy  she was apt to think of poetry when she should have been thinking of taffeta  her walk was a little too much of a stride for a woman  perhaps  and her gestures  being abrupt  might endanger a cup of tea on occasion 
1685,whether this slight disability was enough to counterbalance the splendour of her bearing  or whether she inherited a drop too much of that black humour which ran in the veins of all her race  certain it is that she had not been in the world more than a score of times before she might have been heard to ask herself  had there been anybody but her spaniel pippin to hear her   what the devil is the matter with me  
1686,the occasion was tuesday  the th of june   she had just returned from a great ball at arlington house  the dawn was in the sky  and she was pulling off her stockings 
1687, i do not care if i never meet another soul as long as i live   cried orlando  bursting into tears 
1688,lovers she had in plenty  but life  which is  after all  of some importance in its way  escaped her 
1689, is this   she asked  but there was none to answer   is this   she finished her sentence all the same   what people call life  
1690,the spaniel raised her forepaw in token of sympathy 
1691,the spaniel licked orlando with her tongue 
1692,orlando stroked the spaniel with her hand 
1693,orlando kissed the spaniel with her lips 
1694,in short  there was the truest sympathy between them that can be between a dog and its mistress  and yet it cannot be denied that the dumbness of animals is a great impediment to the refinements of intercourse 
1695,they wag their tails  they bow the front part of the body and elevate the hind  they roll  they jump  they paw  they whine  they bark  they slobber  they have all sorts of ceremonies and artifices of their own  but the whole thing is of no avail  since speak they cannot 
1696,such was her quarrel  she thought  setting the dog gently on to the floor  with the great people at arlington house 
1697,they  too  wag their tails  bow  roll  jump  paw  and slobber  but talk they cannot 
1698, these months that I have been out in the world   said orlando  pitching one stocking across the room   I have heard nothing but what pippin might have said  I am cold  I am happy  I am hungry  I have caught a mouse  I have buried a bone  please kiss my nose  
1699,and it was not enough 
1700,how  in so short a time  she had passed from intoxication to disgust we will only seek to explain by supposing that this mysterious composition which we call society  is nothing absolutely good or bad in itself  but has a spirit in it  volatile but potent  which either makes you drunk when you think it  as orlando thought it  delightful  or gives you a headache when you think it  as orlando thought it  repulsive 
1701,that the faculty of speech has much to do with it either way  we take leave to doubt 
1702,often a dumb hour is the most ravishing of all  brilliant wit can be tedious beyond description 
1703,but to the poets we leave it  and so on with our story 
1704,orlando threw the second stocking after the first and went to bed dismally enough  determined that she would forswear society for ever 
1705,but again as it turned out  she was too hasty in coming to her conclusions 
1706,for the very next morning she woke to find  among the usual cards of invitation upon her table  one from a certain great lady  the countess of r  having determined overnight that she would never go into society again  we can only explain orlando own behaviour  she sent a messenger hot foot to r   house to say that she would attend her ladyship with all the pleasure in the world  by the fact that she was still suffering from the effect of three honeyed words dropped into her ear on the deck of the  enamoured lady  by captain nicholas benedict bartolus as they sailed down the thames 
1707,addison  dryden  pope  he had said  pointing to the cocoa tree  and addison  dryden  pope had chimed in her head like an incantation ever since 
1708,who can credit such folly 
1709,but so it was 
1710,all her experience with nick greene had taught her nothing 
1711,such names still exercised over her the most powerful fascination 
1712,something  perhaps  we must believe in  and as orlando  we have said  had no belief in the usual divinities she bestowed her credulity upon great men  yet with a distinction 
1713,admirals  soldiers  statesmen  moved her not at all 
1714,but the very thought of a great writer stirred her to such a pitch of belief that she almost believed him to be invisible 
1715,her instinct was a sound one 
1716,one can only believe entirely  perhaps  in what one cannot see 
1717,the little glimpse she had of these great men from the deck of the ship was of the nature of a vision 
1718,that the cup was china  or the gazette paper  she doubted 
1719,when lord o  said one day that he had dined with dryden the night before  she flatly disbelieved him 
1720,now  the lady r  own reception room had the reputation of being the antechamber to the presence room of genius  it was the place where men and women met to swing censers and chant hymns to the bust of genius in a niche in the wall 
1721,sometimes the god himself vouchsafed his presence for a moment 
1722,intellect alone admitted the suppliant  and nothing  so the report ran  was said inside that was not witty 
1723,it was thus with great trepidation that orlando entered the room 
1724,she found a company already assembled in a semicircle round the fire 
1725,lady r   an oldish lady  of dark complexion  with a black lace mantilla on her head  was seated in a great arm chair in the centre 
1726,thus being somewhat deaf  she could control the conversation on both sides of her 
1727,on both sides of her sat men and women of the highest distinction 
1728,every man  it was said  had been a prime minister and every woman  it was whispered  had been the mistress of a king 
1729,certain it is that all were brilliant  and all were famous 
1730,orlando took her seat with a deep reverence in silence   after three hours  she curtseyed profoundly and left 
1731,but what  the reader may ask with some exasperation  happened in between 
1732,in three hours  such a company must have said the wittiest  the profoundest  the most interesting things in the world 
1733,so it would seem indeed 
1734,but the fact appears to be that they said nothing 
1735,it is a curious characteristic which they share with all the most brilliant societies that the world has seen 
1736,old madame du deffand and her friends talked for fifty years without stopping 
1737,and of it all  what remains 
1738,perhaps three witty sayings 
1739,so that we are at liberty to suppose either that nothing was said  or that nothing witty was said  or that the fraction of three witty sayings lasted eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty nights  which does not leave a liberal allowance of wit for any one of them 
1740,the truth would seem to be  if we dare use such a word in such a connection  that all these groups of people lie under an enchantment 
1741,the hostess is our modern sibyl 
1742,she is a witch who lays her guests under a spell 
1743,in this house they think themselves happy  in that witty  in a third profound 
1744,it is all an illusion  which is nothing against it  for illusions are the most valuable and necessary of all things  and she who can create one is among the world own greatest benefactors   but as it is notorious that illusions are shattered by conflict with reality  so no real happiness  no real wit  no real profundity are tolerated where the illusion prevails 
1745,this serves to explain why madame du deffand said no more than three witty things in the course of fifty years 
1746,had she said more  her circle would have been destroyed 
1747,the witticism  as it left her lips  bowled over the current conversation as a cannon ball lays low the violets and the daisies 
1748,when she made her famous  mot de saint denis  the very grass was singed 
1749,disillusionment and desolation followed 
1750,not a word was uttered 
1751, ownpare us another such  for heaven own sake  madame   her friends cried with one accord 
1752,and she obeyed 
1753,for almost seventeen years she said nothing memorable and all went well 
1754,the beautiful counterpane of illusion lay unbroken on her circle as it lay unbroken on the circle of lady r  the guests thought that they were happy  thought that they were witty  thought that they were profound  and  as they thought this  other people thought it still more strongly  and so it got about that nothing was more delightful than one of lady r  own assemblies  everyone envied those who were admitted  those who were admitted envied themselves because other people envied them  and so there seemed no end to it  except that which we have now to relate 
1755,for about the third time orlando went there a certain incident occurred 
1756,she was still under the illusion that she was listening to the most brilliant epigrams in the world  though  as a matter of fact  old general c  was only saying  at some length  how the gout had left his left leg and gone to his right  while mr l  interrupted when any proper name was mentioned   r 
1757,i know billy r  as well as i know myself 
1758,my dearest friend 
1759,stayed with him a fortnight in yorkshire   which  such is the force of illusion  sounded like the wittiest repartee  the most searching comment upon human life  and kept the company in a roar  when the door opened and a little gentleman entered whose name orlando did not catch 
1760,soon a curiously disagreeable sensation came over her 
1761,to judge from their faces  the rest began to feel it as well 
1762,one gentleman said there was a draught 
1763,the marchioness of c  feared a cat must be under the sofa 
1764,it was as if their eyes were being slowly opened after a pleasant dream and nothing met them but a cheap wash stand and a dirty counterpane 
1765,it was as if the fumes of some delicious wine were slowly leaving them 
1766,still the general talked and still mr l  remembered 
1767,but it became more and more apparent how red the general own neck was  how bald mr l  own head was 
1768,as for what they said  nothing more tedious and trivial could be imagined 
1769,everybody fidgeted and those who had fans yawned behind them 
1770,at last lady r  rapped with hers upon the arm of her great chair 
1771,both gentlemen stopped talking 
1772,then the little gentleman said  he said next  he said finally  these sayings are too well known to require repetition  and besides  they are all to be found in his published works   
1773,here  it cannot be denied  was true wit  true wisdom  true profundity 
1774,the company was thrown into complete dismay 
1775,one such saying was bad enough  but three  one after another  on the same evening 
1776,no society could survive it 
1777, mr pope   said old lady r  in a voice trembling with sarcastic fury   you are pleased to be witty  
1778,mr pope flushed red 
1779,nobody spoke a word 
1780,they sat in dead silence some twenty minutes 
1781,then  one by one  they rose and slunk from the room 
1782,that they would ever come back after such an experience was doubtful 
1783,link boys could be heard calling their coaches all down south audley street 
1784,doors were slammed and carriages drove off 
1785,orlando found herself near mr pope on the staircase 
1786,his lean and misshapen frame was shaken by a variety of emotions 
1787,darts of malice  rage  triumph  wit  and terror  he was shaking like a leaf  shot from his eyes 
1788,he looked like some squat reptile set with a burning topaz in its forehead 
1789,at the same time  the strangest tempest of emotion seized now upon the luckless orlando 
1790,a disillusionment so complete as that inflicted not an hour ago leaves the mind rocking from side to side 
1791,everything appears ten times more bare and stark than before 
1792,it is a moment fraught with the highest danger for the human spirit 
1793,women turn nuns and men priests in such moments 
1794,in such moments  rich men sign away their wealth  and happy men cut their throats with carving knives 
1795,orlando would have done all willingly  but there was a rasher thing still for her to do  and this she did 
1796,she invited mr pope to come home with her 
1797,for if it is rash to walk into a lion own den unarmed  rash to navigate the atlantic in a rowing boat  rash to stand on one foot on the top of st paul own  it is still more rash to go home alone with a poet 
1798,a poet is atlantic and lion in one 
1799,while one drowns us the other gnaws us 
1800,if we survive the teeth  we succumb to the waves 
1801,a man who can destroy illusions is both beast and flood 
1802,illusions are to the soul what atmosphere is to the earth 
1803,roll up that tender air and the plant dies  the colour fades 
1804,the earth we walk on is a parched cinder 
1805,it is marl we tread and fiery cobbles scorch our feet 
1806,by the truth we are undone 
1807,life is a dream 
1808,it is waking that kills us 
1809,he who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life   and so on for six pages if you will  but the style is tedious and may well be dropped  
1810,on this showing  however  orlando should have been a heap of cinders by the time the chariot drew up at her house in blackfriars 
1811,that she was still flesh and blood  though certainly exhausted  is entirely due to a fact to which we drew attention earlier in the narrative 
1812,the less we see the more we believe 
1813,now the streets that lie between mayfair and blackfriars were at that time very imperfectly lit 
1814,true  the lighting was a great improvement upon that of the elizabethan age 
1815,then the benighted traveller had to trust to the stars or the red flame of some night watchman to save him from the gravel pits at park lane or the oak woods where swine rooted in the tottenham court road 
1816,but even so it wanted much of our modern efficiency 
1817,lamp posts lit with oil lamps occurred every two hundred yards or so  but between lay a considerable stretch of pitch darkness 
1818,thus for ten minutes orlando and mr pope would be in blackness  and then for about half a minute again in the light 
1819,a very strange state of mind was thus bred in orlando 
1820,as the light faded  she began to feel steal over her the most delicious balm 
1821, this is indeed a very great honour for a young woman to be driving with mr pope   she began to think  looking at the outline of his nose 
1822, i am the most blessed of my sex  half an inch from me  indeed  i feel the knot of his knee ribbons pressing against my thigh  is the greatest wit in her majesty own dominions  future ages will think of us with curiosity and envy me with fury  
1823,here came the lamp post again 
1824, what a foolish wretch i am   she thought 
1825, there is no such thing as fame and glory  ages to come will never cast a thought on me or on mr pope either  what is an  age   indeed  what are  we    and their progress through berkeley square seemed the groping of two blind ants  momentarily thrown together without interest or concern in common  across a blackened desert 
1826,she shivered 
1827,but here again was darkness 
1828,her illusion revived 
1829, how noble his brow is   she thought  mistaking a hump on a cushion for mr pope own forehead in the darkness  
1830, what a weight of genius lives in it  what wit  wisdom  and truth  what a wealth of all those jewels  indeed  for which people are ready to barter their lives  yours is the only light that burns for ever  but for you the human pilgrimage would be performed in utter darkness    here the coach gave a great lurch as it fell into a rut in park lane   without genius we should be upset and undone  most august  most lucid of beams    thus she was apostrophizing the hump on the cushion when they drove beneath one of the street lamps in berkeley square and she realized her mistake 
1831,mr pope had a forehead no bigger than another man own 
1832, wretched man   she thought   how you have deceived me  i took that hump for your forehead  when one sees you plain  how ignoble  how despicable you are  deformed and weakly  there is nothing to venerate in you  much to pity  most to despise  
1833,again they were in darkness and her anger became modified directly she could see nothing but the poet own knees 
1834, but it is i that am a wretch   she reflected  once they were in complete obscurity again   for base as you may be  am i not still baser  it is you who nourish and protect me  you who scare the wild beast  frighten the savage  make me clothes of the silkworm own wool  and carpets of the sheep own  if i want to worship  have you not provided me with an image of yourself and set it in the sky  are not evidences of your care everywhere  how humble  how grateful  how docile  should i not be  therefore  let it be all my joy to serve  honour  and obey you  
1835,here they reached the big lamp post at the corner of what is now piccadilly circus 
1836,the light blazed in her eyes  and she saw  besides some degraded creatures of her own sex  two wretched pigmies on a stark desert land 
1837,both were naked  solitary  and defenceless 
1838,the one was powerless to help the other 
1839,each had enough to do to look after itself 
1840,looking mr pope full in the face   it is equally vain   she thought   for you to think you can protect me  or for me to think i can worship you 
1841,the light of truth beats upon us without shadow  and the light of truth is damnably unbecoming to us both 
1842,all this time  of course  they went on talking agreeably  as people of birth and education use  about the queen own temper and the prime minister own gout  while the coach went from light to darkness down the haymarket  along the strand  up fleet street  and reached  at length  her house in blackfriars 
1843,for some time the dark spaces between the lamps had been becoming brighter and the lamps themselves less bright  that is to say  the sun was rising  and it was in the equable but confused light of a summer own morning in which everything is seen but nothing is seen distinctly that they alighted  mr pope handing orlando from her carriage and orlando curtseying mr pope to precede her into her mansion with the most scrupulous attention to the rites of the graces 
1844,from the foregoing passage  however  it must not be supposed that genius  but the disease is now stamped out in the british isles  the late lord tennyson  it is said  being the last person to suffer from it  is constantly alight  for then we should see everything plain and perhaps should be scorched to death in the process 
1845,rather it resembles the lighthouse in its working  which sends one ray and then no more for a time  save that genius is much more capricious in its manifestations and may flash six or seven beams in quick succession  as mr pope did that night  and then lapse into darkness for a year or for ever 
1846,to steer by its beams is therefore impossible  and when the dark spell is on them men of genius are  it is said  much like other people 
1847,it was happy for orlando  though at first disappointing  that this should be so  for she now began to live much in the company of men of genius 
1848,nor were they so different from the rest of us as one might have supposed 
1849,addison  pope  swift  proved  she found  to be fond of tea 
1850,they liked arbours 
1851,they collected little bits of coloured glass 
1852,they adored grottos 
1853,rank was not distasteful to them 
1854,praise was delightful 
1855,they wore plum coloured suits one day and grey another 
1856,mr swift had a fine malacca cane 
1857,mr addison scented his handkerchiefs 
1858,mr pope suffered with his head 
1859,a piece of gossip did not come amiss 
1860,nor were they without their jealousies 
1861, we are jotting down a few reflections that came to orlando higgledy piggledy  
1862,at first  she was annoyed with herself for noticing such trifles  and kept a book in which to write down their memorable sayings  but the page remained empty 
1863,all the same  her spirits revived  and she took to tearing up her cards of invitation to great parties  kept her evenings free  began to look forward to mr pope own visit  to mr addison own  to mr swift own  and so on and so on 
1864,if the reader will here refer to the  rape of the lock   to the  spectator   to  gulliver own travels   he will understand precisely what these mysterious words may mean 
1865,indeed  biographers and critics might save themselves all their labours if readers would only take this advice 
1866,for when we read 
1867,whether the nymph shall break diana own law  or some frail china jar receive a flaw  or stain her honour  or her new brocade  forget her pray rs or miss a masquerade  or lose her heart  or necklace  at a ball 
1868,  we know as if we heard him how mr pope own tongue flickered like a lizard own  how his eyes flashed  how his hand trembled  how he loved  how he lied  how he suffered 
1869,in short  every secret of a writer own soul  every experience of his life  every quality of his mind is written large in his works  yet we require critics to explain the one and biographers to expound the other 
1870,that time hangs heavy on people own hands is the only explanation of the monstrous growth 
1871,so  now that we have read a page or two of the  rape of the lock   we know exactly why orlando was so much amused and so much frightened and so very bright cheeked and bright eyed that afternoon 
1872,mrs nelly then knocked at the door to say that mr addison waited on her ladyship 
1873,at this  mr pope got up with a wry smile  made his congee  and limped off 
1874,in came mr addison 
1875,let us  as he takes his seat  read the following passage from the  spectator  
1876, i consider woman as a beautiful  romantic animal  that may be adorned with furs and feathers  pearls and diamonds  ores and silks 
1877,the lynx shall cast its skin at her feet to make her a tippet  the peacock  parrot and swan shall pay contributions to her muff  the sea shall be searched for shells  and the rocks for gems  and every part of nature furnish out its share towards the embellishment of a creature that is the most consummate work of it 
1878,all this  i shall indulge them in  but as for the petticoat i have been speaking of  i neither can  nor will allow it 
1879,we hold that gentleman  cocked hat and all  in the hollow  of our hands 
1880,look once more into the crystal 
1881,is he not clear to the very wrinkle in his stocking 
1882,does not every ripple and curve of his wit lie exposed before us  and his benignity and his timidity and his urbanity and the fact that he would marry a countess and die very respectably in the end 
1883,all is clear 
1884,and when mr addison has said his say  there is a terrific rap at the door  and mr swift  who had these arbitrary ways with him  walks in unannounced 
1885,one moment  where is  gulliver own travels  
1886,here it is 
1887,let us read a passage from the voyage to the houyhnhnms 
1888, i enjoyed perfect health of body and tranquillity of mind  i did not find the treachery or inconstancy of a friend  nor the injuries of a secret or open enemy 
1889,i had no occasion of bribing  flattering or pimping  to procure the favour of any great man or of his minion 
1890,i wanted no fence against fraud or oppression  here was neither physician to destroy my body  nor lawyer to ruin my fortune  no informer to watch my words  and actions  or forge accusations against me for hire  here were no gibers  censurers  backbiters  pickpockets  highwaymen  housebreakers  attorneys  bawds  buffoons  gamesters  politicians  wits  splenetick tedious talkers    
1891,but stop  stop your iron pelt of words  lest you flay us all alive  and yourself too 
1892,nothing can be plainer than that violent man 
1893,he is so coarse and yet so clean  so brutal  yet so kind  scorns the whole world  yet talks baby language to a girl  and will die  can we doubt it 
1894,in a madhouse 
1895,so orlando poured out tea for them all  and sometimes  when the weather was fine  she carried them down to the country with her  and feasted them royally in the round parlour  which she had hung with their pictures all in a circle  so that mr pope could not say that mr addison came before him  or the other way about 
1896,they were very witty  too  but their wit is all in their books  and taught her the most important part of style  which is the natural run of the voice in speaking  a quality which none that has not heard it can imitate  not greene even  with all his skill  for it is born of the air  and breaks like a wave on the furniture  and rolls and fades away  and is never to be recaptured  least of all by those who prick up their ears  half a century later  and try 
1897,they taught her this  merely by the cadence of their voices in speech  so that her style changed somewhat  and she wrote some very pleasant  witty verses and characters in prose 
1898,and so she lavished her wine on them and put bank notes  which they took very kindly  beneath their plates at dinner  and accepted their dedications  and thought herself highly honoured by the exchange 
1899,thus time ran on  and orlando could often be heard saying to herself with an emphasis which might  perhaps  make the hearer a little suspicious   upon my soul  what a life this is    for she was still in search of that commodity   but circumstances soon forced her to consider the matter more narrowly 
1900,one day she was pouring out tea for mr pope while  as anyone can tell from the verses quoted above  he sat very bright eyed  observant  and all crumpled up in a chair by her side 
1901, lord   she thought  as she raised the sugar tongs   how women in ages to come will envy me  and yet    she paused  for mr pope needed her attention  and yet  let us finish her thought for her  when anybody says  how future ages will envy me   it is safe to say that they are extremely uneasy at the present moment 
1902,was this life quite so exciting  quite so flattering  quite so glorious as it sounds when the memoir writer has done his work upon it 
1903,for one thing  orlando had a positive hatred of tea  for another  the intellect  divine as it is  and all worshipful  has a habit of lodging in the most seedy of carcases  and often  alas  acts the cannibal among the other faculties so that often  where the mind is biggest  the heart  the senses  magnanimity  charity  tolerance  kindliness  and the rest of them scarcely have room to breathe 
1904,then the high opinion poets have of themselves  then the low one they have of others  then the enmities  injuries  envies  and repartees in which they are constantly engaged  then the volubility with which they impart them  then the rapacity with which they demand sympathy for them  all this  one may whisper  lest the wits may overhear us  makes pouring out tea a more precarious and  indeed  arduous occupation than is generally allowed 
1905,added to which  we whisper again lest the women may overhear us   there is a little secret which men share among them  lord chesterfield whispered it to his son with strict injunctions to secrecy   women are but children of a larger growth   a man of sense only trifles with them  plays with them  humours and flatters them   which  since children always hear what they are not meant to  and sometimes  even  grow up  may have somehow leaked out  so that the whole ceremony of pouring out tea is a curious one 
1906,a woman knows very well that  though a wit sends her his poems  praises her judgment  solicits her criticism  and drinks her tea  this by no means signifies that he respects her opinions  admires her understanding  or will refuse  though the rapier is denied him  to run her through the body with his pen 
1907,all this  we say  whisper it as low as we can  may have leaked out by now  so that even with the cream jug suspended and the sugar tongs distended the ladies may fidget a little  look out of the window a little  yawn a little  and so let the sugar fall with a great plop  as orlando did now  into mr pope own tea 
1908,never was any mortal so ready to suspect an insult or so quick to avenge one as mr pope 
1909,he turned to orlando and presented her instantly with the rough draught of a certain famous line in the  characters of women  
1910,much polish was afterwards bestowed on it  but even in the original it was striking enough 
1911,orlando received it with a curtsey 
1912,mr pope left her with a bow 
1913,orlando  to cool her cheeks  for really she felt as if the little man had struck her  strolled in the nut grove at the bottom of the garden 
1914,soon the cool breezes did their work 
1915,to her amazement she found that she was hugely relieved to find herself alone 
1916,she watched the merry boatloads rowing up the river 
1917,no doubt the sight put her in mind of one or two incidents in her past life 
1918,she sat herself down in profound meditation beneath a fine willow tree 
1919,there she sat till the stars were in the sky 
1920,then she rose  turned  and went into the house  where she sought her bedroom and locked the door 
1921,now she opened a cupboard in which hung still many of the clothes she had worn as a young man of fashion  and from among them she chose a black velvet suit richly trimmed with venetian lace 
1922,it was a little out of fashion  indeed  but it fitted her to perfection and dressed in it she looked the very figure of a noble lord 
1923,she took a turn or two before the mirror to make sure that her petticoats had not lost her the freedom of her legs  and then let herself secretly out of doors 
1924,it was a fine night early in april 
1925,a myriad stars mingling with the light of a sickle moon  which again was enforced by the street lamps  made a light infinitely becoming to the human countenance and to the architecture of mr wren 
1926,everything appeared in its tenderest form  yet  just as it seemed on the point of dissolution  some drop of silver sharpened it to animation 
1927,thus it was that talk should be  thought orlando  indulging in foolish reverie   that society should be  that friendship should be  that love should be 
1928,for  heaven knows why  just as we have lost faith in human intercourse some random collocation of barns and trees or a haystack and a waggon presents us with so perfect a symbol of what is unattainable that we begin the search again 
1929,she entered leicester square as she made these observations 
1930,the buildings had an airy yet formal symmetry not theirs by day 
1931,the canopy of the sky seemed most dexterously washed in to fill up the outline of roof and chimney 
1932,a young woman who sat dejectedly with one arm drooping by her side  the other reposing in her lap  on a seat beneath a plane tree in the middle of the square seemed the very figure of grace  simplicity  and desolation 
1933,orlando swept her hat off to her in the manner of a gallant paying his addresses to a lady of fashion in a public place 
1934,the young woman raised her head 
1935,it was of the most exquisite shapeliness 
1936,the young woman raised her eyes 
1937,orlando saw them to be of a lustre such as is sometimes seen on teapots but rarely in a human face 
1938,through this silver glaze the young woman looked up at him  for a man he was to her  appealing  hoping  trembling  fearing 
1939,she rose  she accepted his arm 
1940,for  need we stress the point   she was of the tribe which nightly burnishes their wares  and sets them in order on the common counter to wait the highest bidder 
1941,she led orlando to the room in gerrard street which was her lodging 
1942,to feel her hanging lightly yet like a suppliant on her arm  roused in orlando all the feelings which become a man 
1943,she looked  she felt  she talked like one 
1944,yet  having been so lately a woman herself  she suspected that the girl own timidity and her hesitating answers and the very fumbling with the key in the latch and the fold of her cloak and the droop of her wrist were all put on to gratify her masculinity 
1945,upstairs they went  and the pains which the poor creature had been at to decorate her room and hide the fact that she had no other deceived orlando not a moment 
1946,the deception roused her scorn  the truth roused her pity 
1947,one thing showing through the other bred the oddest assortment of feeling  so that she did not know whether to laugh or to cry 
1948,meanwhile nell  as the girl called herself  unbuttoned her gloves  carefully concealed the left hand thumb  which wanted mending  then drew behind a screen  where  perhaps  she rouged her cheeks  arranged her clothes  fixed a new kerchief round her neck  all the time prattling as women do  to amuse her lover  though orlando could have sworn  from the tone of her voice  that her thoughts were elsewhere  when all was ready  out she came  prepared  but here orlando could stand it no longer 
1949,in the strangest torment of anger  merriment  and pity she flung off all disguise and admitted herself a woman 
1950,at this  nell burst into such a roar of laughter as might have been heard across the way 
1951, well  my dear   she said  when she had somewhat recovered   I am by no means sorry to hear it  for the plain dunstable of the matter is   and it was remarkable how soon  on discovering that they were of the same sex  her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive  appealing ways    the plain dunstable of the matter is  that I am not in the mood for the society of the other sex to night  indeed  I am in the devil of a fix  
1952,whereupon  drawing up the fire and stirring a bowl of punch  she told orlando the whole story of her life 
1953,since it is orlando own life that engages us at present  we need not relate the adventures of the other lady  but it is certain that orlando had never known the hours speed faster or more merrily  though mistress nell had not a particle of wit about her  and when the name of mr pope came up in talk asked innocently if he were connected with the perruque maker of that name in jermyn street 
1954,yet  to orlando  such is the charm of ease and the seduction of beauty  this poor girl own talk  larded though it was with the commonest expressions of the street corners  tasted like wine after the fine phrases she had been used to  and she was forced to the conclusion that there was something in the sneer of mr pope  in the condescension of mr addison  and in the secret of lord chesterfield which took away her relish for the society of wits  deeply though she must continue to respect their works 
1955,these poor creatures  she ascertained  for nell brought prue  and prue kitty  and kitty rose  had a society of their own of which they now elected her a member 
1956,each would tell the story of the adventures which had landed her in her present way of life 
1957,several were the natural daughters of earls and one was a good deal nearer than she should have been to the king own person 
1958,none was too wretched or too poor but to have some ring or handkerchief in her pocket which stood her in lieu of pedigree 
1959,so they would draw round the punch bowl which orlando made it her business to furnish generously  and many were the fine tales they told and many the amusing observations they made  for it cannot be denied that when women get together  but hist  they are always careful to see that the doors are shut and that not a word of it gets into print 
1960,all they desire is  but hist again  is that not a man own step on the stair 
1961,all they desire  we were about to say when the gentleman took the very words out of our mouths 
1962,women have no desires  says this gentleman  coming into nell own parlour  only affectations 
1963,without desires  she has served him and he is gone  their conversation cannot be of the slightest interest to anyone 
1964, it is well known   says mr s  w    that when they lack the stimulus of the other sex  women can find nothing to say to each other  when they are alone  they do not talk  they scratch  
1965,and since they cannot talk together and scratching cannot continue without interruption and it is well known  mr t  r  has proved it   that women are incapable of any feeling of affection for their own sex and hold each other in the greatest aversion   what can we suppose that women do when they seek out each other own society 
1966,as that is not a question that can engage the attention of a sensible man  let us  who enjoy the immunity of all biographers and historians from any sex whatever  pass it over  and merely state that orlando professed great enjoyment in the society of her own sex  and leave it to the gentlemen to prove  as they are very fond of doing  that this is impossible 
1967,but to give an exact and particular account of orlando own life at this time becomes more and more out of the question 
1968,as we peer and grope in the ill lit  ill paved  ill ventilated courtyards that lay about gerrard street and drury lane at that time  we seem now to catch sight of her and then again to lose it 
1969,the task is made still more difficult by the fact that she found it convenient at this time to change frequently from one set of clothes to another 
1970,thus she often occurs in contemporary memoirs as  lord  so and so  who was in fact her cousin  her bounty is ascribed to him  and it is he who is said to have written the poems that were really hers 
1971,she had  it seems  no difficulty in sustaining the different parts  for her sex changed far more frequently than those who have worn only one set of clothing can conceive  nor can there be any doubt that she reaped a twofold harvest by this device  the pleasures of life were increased and its experiences multiplied 
1972,for the probity of breeches she exchanged the seductiveness of petticoats and enjoyed the love of both sexes equally 
1973,so then one may sketch her spending her morning in a china robe of ambiguous gender among her books  then receiving a client or two  for she had many scores of suppliants  in the same garment  then she would take a turn in the garden and clip the nut trees  for which knee breeches were convenient  then she would change into a flowered taffeta which best suited a drive to richmond and a proposal of marriage from some great nobleman  and so back again to town  where she would don a snuff coloured gown like a lawyer own and visit the courts to hear how her cases were doing   for her fortune was wasting hourly and the suits seemed no nearer consummation than they had been a hundred years ago  and so  finally  when night came  she would more often than not become a nobleman complete from head to toe and walk the streets in search of adventure 
1974,returning from some of these junketings  of which there were many stories told at the time  as  that she fought a duel  served on one of the king own ships as a captain  was seen to dance naked on a balcony  and fled with a certain lady to the low countries where the lady own husband followed them  but of the truth or otherwise of these stories  we express no opinion  returning from whatever her occupation may have been  she made a point sometimes of passing beneath the windows of a coffee house  where she could see the wits without being seen  and thus could fancy from their gestures what wise  witty  or spiteful things they were saying without hearing a word of them  which was perhaps an advantage  and once she stood half an hour watching three shadows on the blind drinking tea together in a house in bolt court 
1975,never was any play so absorbing 
1976,she wanted to cry out  bravo 
1977,bravo 
1978,for  to be sure  what a fine drama it was  what a page torn from the thickest volume of human life 
1979,there was the little shadow with the pouting lips  fidgeting this way and that on his chair  uneasy  petulant  officious  there was the bent female shadow  crooking a finger in the cup to feel how deep the tea was  for she was blind  and there was the roman looking rolling shadow in the big armchair  he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast gulps  dr johnson  mr boswell  and mrs williams   those were the shadows  names 
1980,so absorbed was she in the sight  that she forgot to think how other ages would have envied her  though it seems probable that on this occasion they would 
1981,she was content to gaze and gaze 
1982,at length mr boswell rose 
1983,he saluted the old woman with tart asperity 
1984,but with what humility did he not abase himself before the great roman shadow  who now rose to its full height and rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent phrases that ever left human lips  so orlando thought them  though she never heard a word that any of the three shadows said as they sat there drinking tea 
1985,at length she came home one night after one of these saunterings and mounted to her bedroom 
1986,she took off her laced coat and stood there in shirt and breeches looking out of the window 
1987,there was something stirring in the air which forbade her to go to bed 
1988,a white haze lay over the town  for it was a frosty night in midwinter and a magnificent vista lay all round her 
1989,she could see st paul own  the tower  westminster abbey  with all the spires and domes of the city churches  the smooth bulk of its banks  the opulent and ample curves of its halls and meeting places 
1990,on the north rose the smooth  shorn heights of hampstead  and in the west the streets and squares of mayfair shone out in one clear radiance 
1991,upon this serene and orderly prospect the stars looked down  glittering  positive  hard  from a cloudless sky 
1992,in the extreme clearness of the atmosphere the line of every roof  the cowl of every chimney  was perceptible  even the cobbles in the streets showed distinct one from another  and orlando could not help comparing this orderly scene with the irregular and huddled purlieus which had been the city of london in the reign of queen elizabeth 
1993,then  she remembered  the city  if such one could call it  lay crowded  a mere huddle and conglomeration of houses  under her windows at blackfriars 
1994,the stars reflected themselves in deep pits of stagnant water which lay in the middle of the streets 
1995,a black shadow at the corner where the wine shop used to stand was  as likely as not  the corpse of a murdered man 
1996,she could remember the cries of many a one wounded in such night brawlings  when she was a little boy  held to the diamond paned window in her nurse own arms 
1997,troops of ruffians  men and women  unspeakably interlaced  lurched down the streets  trolling out wild songs with jewels flashing in their ears  and knives gleaming in their fists 
1998,on such a night as this the impermeable tangle of the forests on highgate and hampstead would be outlined  writhing in contorted intricacy against the sky 
1999,here and there  on one of the hills which rose above london  was a stark gallows tree  with a corpse nailed to rot or parch on its cross  for danger and insecurity  lust and violence  poetry and filth swarmed over the tortuous elizabethan highways and buzzed and stank  orlando could remember even now the smell of them on a hot night  in the little rooms and narrow pathways of the city 
2000,now  she leant out of her window  all was light  order  and serenity 
2001,there was the faint rattle of a coach on the cobbles 
2002,she heard the far away cry of the night watchman   just twelve of the clock on a frosty morning  
2003,no sooner had the words left his lips than the first stroke of midnight sounded 
2004,orlando then for the first time noticed a small cloud gathered behind the dome of st paul own 
2005,as the strokes sounded  the cloud increased  and she saw it darken and spread with extraordinary speed 
2006,at the same time a light breeze rose and by the time the sixth stroke of midnight had struck the whole of the eastern sky was covered with an irregular moving darkness  though the sky to the west and north stayed clear as ever 
2007,then the cloud spread north 
2008,height upon height above the city was engulfed by it 
2009,only mayfair  with all its lights shining 
2010,burnt more brilliantly than ever by contrast 
2011,with the eighth stroke  some hurrying tatters of cloud sprawled over piccadilly 
2012,they seemed to mass themselves and to advance with extraordinary rapidity towards the west end 
2013,as the ninth  tenth  and eleventh strokes struck  a huge blackness sprawled over the whole of london 
2014,with the twelfth stroke of midnight  the darkness was complete 
2015,a turbulent welter of cloud covered the city 
2016,all was darkness  all was doubt  all was confusion 
2017,the eighteenth century was over  the nineteenth century had begun 
2018,the great cloud which hung  not only over london  but over the whole of the british isles on the first day of the nineteenth century stayed  or rather  did not stay  for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales  long enough to have extraordinary consequences upon those who lived beneath its shadow 
2019,a change seemed to have come over the climate of england 
2020,rain fell frequently  but only in fitful gusts  which were no sooner over than they began again 
2021,the sun shone  of course  but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so saturated with water  that its beams were discoloured and purples  oranges  and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more positive landscapes of the eighteenth century 
2022,under this bruised and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense  and the white of the snow was muddied 
2023,but what was worse  damp now began to make its way into every house  damp  which is the most insidious of all enemies  for while the sun can be shut out by blinds  and the frost roasted by a hot fire  damp steals in while we sleep  damp is silent  imperceptible  ubiquitous 
2024,damp swells the wood  furs the kettle  rusts the iron  rots the stone 
2025,so gradual is the process  that it is not until we pick up some chest of drawers  or coal scuttle  and the whole thing drops to pieces in our hands  that we suspect even that the disease is at work 
2026,thus  stealthily and imperceptibly  none marking the exact day or hour of the change  the constitution of england was altered and nobody knew it 
2027,everywhere the effects were felt 
2028,the hardy country gentleman  who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a room designed  perhaps by the brothers adam  with classic dignity  now felt chilly 
2029,rugs appeared  beards were grown  trousers were fastened tight under the instep 
2030,the chill which he felt in his legs the country gentleman soon transferred to his house  furniture was muffled  walls and tables were covered  nothing was left bare 
2031,then a change of diet became essential 
2032,the muffin was invented and the crumpet 
2033,coffee supplanted the after dinner port  and  as coffee led to a drawing room in which to drink it  and a drawing room to glass cases  and glass cases to artificial flowers  and artificial flowers to mantelpieces  and mantelpieces to pianofortes  and pianofortes to drawing room ballads  and drawing room ballads  skipping a stage or two  to innumerable little dogs  mats  and china ornaments  the home  which had become extremely important  was completely altered 
2034,outside the house  it was another effect of the damp  ivy grew in unparalleled profusion 
2035,houses that had been of bare stone were smothered in greenery 
2036,no garden  however formal its original design  lacked a shrubbery  a wilderness  a maze 
2037,what light penetrated to the bedrooms where children were born was naturally of an obfusc green  and what light penetrated to the drawing rooms where grown men and women lived came through curtains of brown and purple plush 
2038,but the change did not stop at outward things 
2039,the damp struck within 
2040,men felt the chill in their hearts  the damp in their minds 
2041,in a desperate effort to snuggle their feelings into some sort of warmth one subterfuge was tried after another 
2042,love  birth  and death were all swaddled in a variety of fine phrases 
2043,the sexes drew further and further apart 
2044,no open conversation was tolerated 
2045,evasions and concealments were sedulously practised on both sides 
2046,and just as the ivy and the evergreen rioted in the damp earth outside  so did the same fertility show itself within 
2047,the life of the average woman was a succession of childbirths 
2048,she married at nineteen and had fifteen or eighteen children by the time she was thirty  for twins abounded 
2049,thus the british empire came into existence  and thus  for there is no stopping damp  it gets into the inkpot as it gets into the woodwork  sentences swelled  adjectives multiplied  lyrics became epics  and little trifles that had been essays a column long were now encyclopaedias in ten or twenty volumes 
2050,but eusebius chubb shall be our witness to the effect this all had upon the mind of a sensitive man who could do nothing to stop it 
2051,there is a passage towards the end of his memoirs where he describes how  after writing thirty five folio pages one morning  about nothing  he screwed the lid of his inkpot and went for a turn in his garden 
2052,soon he found himself involved in the shrubbery 
2053,innumerable leaves creaked and glistened above his head 
2054,he seemed to himself  to crush the mould of a million more under his feet  
2055,thick smoke exuded from a damp bonfire at the end of the garden 
2056,he reflected that no fire on earth could ever hope to consume that vast vegetable encumbrance 
2057,wherever he looked  vegetation was rampant 
2058,cucumbers  came scrolloping across the grass to his feet  
2059,giant cauliflowers towered deck above deck till they rivalled  to his disordered imagination  the elm trees themselves 
2060,hens laid incessantly eggs of no special tint 
2061,then  remembering with a sigh his own fecundity and his poor wife jane  now in the throes of her fifteenth confinement indoors  how  he asked himself  could he blame the fowls 
2062,he looked upwards into the sky 
2063,did not heaven itself  or that great frontispiece of heaven  which is the sky  indicate the assent  indeed  the instigation of the heavenly hierarchy 
2064,for there  winter or summer  year in year out  the clouds turned and tumbled  like whales  he pondered  or elephants rather  but no  there was no escaping the simile which was pressed upon him from a thousand airy acres  the whole sky itself as it spread wide above the british isles was nothing but a vast feather bed  and the undistinguished fecundity of the garden  the bedroom and the henroost was copied there 
2065,he went indoors  wrote the passage quoted above  laid his head in a gas oven  and when they found him later he was past revival 
2066,while this went on in every part of england  it was all very well for orlando to mew herself in her house at blackfriars and pretend that the climate was the same  that one could still say what one liked and wear knee breeches or skirts as the fancy took one 
2067,even she  at length  was forced to acknowledge that times were changed 
2068,one afternoon in the early part of the century she was driving through st james own park in her old panelled coach when one of those sunbeams  which occasionally  though not often  managed to come to earth  struggled through  marbling the clouds with strange prismatic colours as it passed 
2069,such a sight was sufficiently strange after the clear and uniform skies of the eighteenth century to because her to pull the window down and look at it 
2070,the puce and flamingo clouds made her think with a pleasurable anguish  which proves that she was insensibly afflicted with the damp already  of dolphins dying in ionian seas 
2071,but what was her surprise when  as it struck the earth  the sunbeam seemed to call forth  or to light up  a pyramid  hecatomb  or trophy  for it had something of a banquet table air   a conglomeration at any rate of the most heterogeneous and ill assorted objects  piled higgledy piggledy in a vast mound where the statue of queen victoria now stands 
2072,draped about a vast cross of fretted and floriated gold were widow own weeds and bridal veils  hooked on to other excrescences were crystal palaces  bassinettes  military helmets  memorial wreaths  trousers  whiskers  wedding cakes  cannon  christmas trees  telescopes  extinct monsters  globes  maps  elephants  and mathematical instruments  the whole supported like a gigantic coat of arms on the right side by a female figure clothed in flowing white  on the left by a portly gentleman wearing a frock coat and sponge bag trousers 
2073,the incongruity of the objects  the association of the fully clothed and the partly draped  the garishness of the different colours and their plaid like juxtapositions afflicted orlando with the most profound dismay 
2074,she had never  in all her life  seen anything at once so indecent  so hideous  and so monumental 
2075,it might  and indeed it must be  the effect of the sun on the water logged air  it would vanish with the first breeze that blew  but for all that  it looked  as she drove past  as if it were destined to endure for ever 
2076,nothing  she felt  sinking back into the corner of her coach  no wind  rain  sun  or thunder  could ever demolish that garish erection 
2077,only the noses would mottle and the trumpets would rust  but there they would remain  pointing east  west  south  and north  eternally 
2078,she looked back as her coach swept up constitution hill 
2079,yes  there it was  still beaming placidly in a light which  she pulled her watch out of her fob  was  of course  the light of twelve of the clock mid day 
2080,none other could be so prosaic  so matter of fact  so impervious to any hint of dawn or sunset  so seemingly calculated to last for ever 
2081,she was determined not to look again 
2082,already she felt the tides of her blood run sluggishly 
2083,but what was more peculiar a blush  vivid and singular  overspread her cheeks as she passed buckingham palace and her eyes seemed forced by a superior power down upon her knees 
2084,suddenly she saw with a start that she was wearing black breeches 
2085,she never ceased blushing till she had reached her country house  which  considering the time it takes four horses to trot thirty miles  will be taken  we hope  as a signal proof of her chastity 
2086,once there  she followed what had now become the most imperious need of her nature and wrapped herself as well as she could in a damask quilt which she snatched from her bed 
2087,she explained to the widow bartholomew  who had succeeded good old grimsditch as housekeeper  that she felt chilly 
2088, owno do we all  m lady   said the widow  heaving a profound sigh 
2089, the walls is sweating   she said  with a curious  lugubrious complacency  and sure enough  she had only to lay her hand on the oak panels for the finger prints to be marked there 
2090,the ivy had grown so profusely that many windows were now sealed up 
2091,the kitchen was so dark that they could scarcely tell a kettle from a cullender 
2092,a poor black cat had been mistaken for coals and shovelled on the fire 
2093,most of the maids were already wearing three or four red flannel petticoats  though the month was august 
2094, but is it true  m lady   the good woman asked  hugging herself  while the golden crucifix heaved on her bosom   that the queen  bless her  is wearing a what d you call it  a     the good woman hesitated and blushed 
2095, a crinoline   orlando helped her out with it  for the word had reached blackfriars  
2096,mrs bartholomew nodded 
2097,the tears were already running down her cheeks  but as she wept she smiled 
2098,for it was pleasant to weep 
2099,were they not all of them weak women 
2100,wearing crinolines the better to conceal the fact  the great fact  the only fact  but  nevertheless  the deplorable fact  which every modest woman did her best to deny until denial was impossible  the fact that she was about to bear a child 
2101,to bear fifteen or twenty children indeed  so that most of a modest woman own life was spent  after all  in denying what  on one day at least of every year  was made obvious 
2102, the muffins is keepin   ot   said mrs bartholomew  mopping up her tears   in the liberry  
2103,and wrapped in a damask bed quilt  to a dish of muffins orlando now sat down 
2104, the muffins is keepin   ot in the liberry   orlando minced out the horrid cockney phrase in mrs bartholomew own refined cockney accents as she drank  but no  she detested the mild fluid  her tea  it was in this very room  she remembered  that queen elizabeth had stood astride the fireplace with a flagon of beer in her hand  which she suddenly dashed on the table when lord burghley tactlessly used the imperative instead of the subjunctive   little man  little man    orlando could hear her say   is  must  a word to be addressed to princes  
2105,and down came the flagon on the table  there was the mark of it still 
2106,but when orlando leapt to her feet  as the mere thought of that great queen commanded  the bed quilt tripped her up  and she fell back in her arm chair with a curse 
2107,tomorrow she would have to buy twenty yards or more of black bombazine  she supposed  to make a skirt 
2108,and then  here she blushed   she would have to buy a crinoline  and then  here she blushed  a bassinette  and then another crinoline  and so on   the blushes came and went with the most exquisite iteration of modesty and shame imaginable 
2109,one might see the spirit of the age blowing  now hot  now cold  upon her cheeks 
2110,and if the spirit of the age blew a little unequally  the crinoline being blushed for before the husband  her ambiguous position must excuse her  even her sex was still in dispute  and the irregular life she had lived before 
2111,at length the colour on her cheeks resumed its stability and it seemed as if the spirit of the age  if such indeed it were  lay dormant for a time 
2112,then orlando felt in the bosom of her shirt as if for some locket or relic of lost affection  and drew out no such thing  but a roll of paper  sea stained  blood stained  travel stained  the manuscript of her poem   the oak tree  
2113,she had carried this about with her for so many years now  and in such hazardous circumstances  that many of the pages were stained  some were torn  while the straits she had been in for writing paper when with the gipsies  had forced her to overscore the margins and cross the lines till the manuscript looked like a piece of darning most conscientiously carried out 
2114,she turned back to the first page and read the date    written in her own boyish hand 
2115,she had been working at it for close three hundred years now 
2116,it was time to make an end 
2117,meanwhile she began turning and dipping and reading and skipping and thinking as she read  how very little she had changed all these years 
2118,she had been a gloomy boy  in love with death  as boys are  and then she had been amorous and florid  and then she had been sprightly and satirical  and sometimes she had tried prose and sometimes she had tried drama 
2119,yet through all these changes she had remained  she reflected  fundamentally the same 
2120,she had the same brooding meditative temper  the same love of animals and nature  the same passion for the country and the seasons 
2121, after all   she thought  getting up and going to the window   nothing has changed  the house  the garden are precisely as they were  not a chair has been moved  not a trinket sold  there are the same walks  the same lawns  the same trees  and the same pool  which  i dare say  has the same carp in it  true  queen victoria is on the throne and not queen elizabeth  but what difference    
2122,no sooner had the thought taken shape  than  as if to rebuke it  the door was flung wide and in marched basket  the butler  followed by bartholomew  the housekeeper  to clear away tea 
2123,orlando  who had just dipped her pen in the ink  and was about to indite some reflection upon the eternity of all things  was much annoyed to be impeded by a blot  which spread and meandered round her pen 
2124,it was some infirmity of the quill  she supposed  it was split or dirty 
2125,she dipped it again 
2126,the blot increased 
2127,she tried to go on with what she was saying  no words came 
2128,next she began to decorate the blot with wings and whiskers  till it became a round headed monster  something between a bat and a wombat 
2129,but as for writing poetry with basket and bartholomew in the room  it was impossible 
2130,no sooner had she said  impossible  than  to her astonishment and alarm  the pen began to curve and caracole with the smoothest possible fluency 
2131,her page was written in the neatest sloping italian hand with the most insipid verse she had ever read in her life 
2132,i am myself but a vile link amid life own weary chain  but i have spoken hallow d words  oh  do not say in vain 
2133,will the young maiden  when her tears  alone in moonlight shine  tears for the absent and the loved  murmur  
2134,she wrote without a stop as bartholomew and basket grunted and groaned about the room  mending the fire  picking up the muffins 
2135,again she dipped her pen and off it went   
2136,she was so changed  the soft carnation cloud once mantling over her cheek like that which eve hangs over the sky  glowing with roseate hue  had faded into paleness  broken by bright burning blushes  torches of the tomb 
2137,but here  by an abrupt movement she spilt the ink ever the page and blotted it from human sight she hoped for ever 
2138,she was all of a quiver  all of a stew 
2139,nothing more repulsive could be imagined than to feel the ink flowing thus in cascades of involuntary inspiration 
2140,what had happened to her 
2141,was it the damp  was it bartholomew  was it basket  what was it 
2142,she demanded 
2143,but the room was empty 
2144,no one answered her  unless the dripping of the rain in the ivy could be taken for an answer 
2145,meanwhile  she became conscious  as she stood at the window  of an extraordinary tingling and vibration all over her  as if she were made of a thousand wires upon which some breeze or errant fingers were playing scales 
2146,now her toes tingled  now her marrow 
2147,she had the queerest sensations about the thigh bones 
2148,her hairs seemed to erect themselves 
2149,her arms sang and twanged as the telegraph wires would be singing and twanging in twenty years or so 
2150,but all this agitation seemed at length to concentrate in her hands  and then in one hand  and then in one finger of that hand  and then finally to contract itself so that it made a ring of quivering sensibility about the second finger of the left hand 
2151,and when she raised it to see what caused this agitation  she saw nothing  nothing but the vast solitary emerald which queen elizabeth had given her  and was that not enough  she asked  it was of the finest water  it was worth ten thousand pounds at least  the vibration seemed  in the oddest way  but remember we are dealing with some of the darkest manifestations of the human soul  to say no  that is not enough  and  further  to assume a note of interrogation  as though it were asking  what did it mean  this hiatus  this strange oversight  till poor orlando felt positively ashamed of the second finger of her left hand without in the least knowing why  at this moment  bartholomew came in to ask which dress she should lay out for dinner  and orlando  whose senses were much quickened  instantly glanced at bartholomew own left hand  and instantly perceived what she had never noticed before  a thick ring of rather jaundiced yellow circling the third finger where her own was bare 
2152, let me look at your ring  bartholomew   she said  stretching her hand to take it 
2153,at this  bartholomew made as if she had been struck in the breast by a rogue 
2154,she started back a pace or two  clenched her hand and flung it away from her with a gesture that was noble in the extreme 
2155, no   she said  with resolute dignity  her ladyship might look if she pleased  but as for taking off her wedding ring  not the archbishop nor the pope nor queen victoria on her throne could force her to do that 
2156,her thomas had put it on her finger twenty five years  six months  three weeks ago  she had slept in it  worked in it  washed in it  prayed in it  and proposed to be buried in it 
2157,in fact  orlando understood her to say  but her voice was much broken with emotion  that it was by the gleam on her wedding ring that she would be assigned her station among the angels and its lustre would be tarnished for ever if she let it out of her keeping for a second 
2158, heaven help us   said orlando  standing at the window and watching the pigeons at their pranks   what a world we live in  what a world to be sure  
2159,its complexities amazed her 
2160,it now seemed to her that the whole world was ringed with gold 
2161,she went in to dinner 
2162,wedding rings abounded 
2163,she went to church 
2164,wedding rings were everywhere 
2165,she drove out 
2166,gold  or pinchbeck  thin  thick  plain  smooth  they glowed dully on every hand 
2167,rings filled the jewellers  shops  not the flashing pastes and diamonds of orlando own recollection  but simple bands without a stone in them 
2168,at the same time  she began to notice a new habit among the town people 
2169,in the old days  one would meet a boy trifling with a girl under a hawthorn hedge frequently enough 
2170,orlando had flicked many a couple with the tip of her whip and laughed and passed on 
2171,now  all that was changed 
2172,couples trudged and plodded in the middle of the road indissolubly linked together 
2173,the woman own right hand was invariably passed through the man own left and her fingers were firmly gripped by his 
2174,often it was not till the horses  noses were on them that they budged  and then  though they moved it was all in one piece  heavily  to the side of the road 
2175,orlando could only suppose that some new discovery had been made about the race  that they were somehow stuck together  couple after couple  but who had made it and when  she could not guess 
2176,it did not seem to be nature 
2177,she looked at the doves and the rabbits and the elk hounds and she could not see that nature had changed her ways or mended them  since the time of elizabeth at least 
2178,there was no indissoluble alliance among the brutes that she could see 
2179,could it be queen victoria then  or lord melbourne 
2180,was it from them that the great discovery of marriage proceeded 
2181,yet the queen  she pondered  was said to be fond of dogs  and lord melbourne  she had heard  was said to be fond of women 
2182,it was strange  it was distasteful  indeed  there was something in this indissolubility of bodies which was repugnant to her sense of decency and sanitation  her ruminations  however  were accompanied by such a tingling and twanging of the afflicted finger that she could scarcely keep her ideas in order  they were languishing and ogling like a housemaid own fancies  they made her blush  there was nothing for it but to buy one of those ugly bands and wear it like the rest  this she did  slipping it  overcome with shame  upon her finger in the shadow of a curtain  but without avail  the tingling persisted more violently  more indignantly than ever  she did not sleep a wink that night  next morning when she took up the pen to write  either she could think of nothing  and the pen made one large lachrymose blot after another  or it ambled off  more alarmingly still  into mellifluous fluencies about early death and corruption  which were worse than no thinking at all  for it would seem  her case proved it  that we write  not with the fingers  but with the whole person 
2183,the nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every fibre of our being  threads the heart  pierces the liver 
2184,though the seat of her trouble seemed to be the left hand  she could feel herself poisoned through and through  and was forced at length to consider the most desperate of remedies  which was to yield completely and submissively to the spirit of the age  and take a husband 
2185,that this was much against her natural temperament has been sufficiently made plain 
2186,when the sound of the archduke own chariot wheels died away  the cry that rose to her lips was  life  a lover   not  life  a husband   and it was in pursuit of this aim that she had gone to town and run about the world as has been shown in the previous chapter 
2187,such is the indomitable nature of the spirit of the age  however  that it batters down anyone who tries to make stand against it far more effectually than those who bend its own way 
2188,orlando had inclined herself naturally to the elizabethan spirit  to the restoration spirit  to the spirit of the eighteenth century  and had in consequence scarcely been aware of the change from one age to the other 
2189,but the spirit of the nineteenth century was antipathetic to her in the extreme  and thus it took her and broke her  and she was aware of her defeat at its hands as she had never been before 
2190,for it is probable that the human spirit has its place in time assigned to it  some are born of this age  some of that  and now that orlando was grown a woman  a year or two past thirty indeed  the lines of her character were fixed  and to bend them the wrong way was intolerable 
2191,so she stood mournfully at the drawing room window  bartholomew had so christened the library  dragged down by the weight of the crinoline which she had submissively adopted 
2192,it was heavier and more drab than any dress she had yet worn 
2193,none had ever so impeded her movements 
2194,no longer could she stride through the garden with her dogs  or run lightly to the high mound and fling herself beneath the oak tree 
2195,her skirts collected damp leaves and straw 
2196,the plumed hat tossed on the breeze 
2197,the thin shoes were quickly soaked and mud caked 
2198,her muscles had lost their pliancy 
2199,she became nervous lest there should be robbers behind the wainscot and afraid  for the first time in her life  of ghosts in the corridors 
2200,all these things inclined her  step by step  to submit to the new discovery  whether queen victoria own or another own  that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life  whom it supports  by whom it is supported  till death them do part 
2201,it would be a comfort  she felt  to lean  to sit down  yes  to lie down  never  never  never to get up again 
2202,thus did the spirit work upon her  for all her past pride  and as she came sloping down the scale of emotion to this lowly and unaccustomed lodging place  those twangings and tinglings which had been so captious and so interrogative modulated into the sweetest melodies  till it seemed as if angels were plucking harp strings with white fingers and her whole being was pervaded by a seraphic harmony 
2203,but whom could she lean upon 
2204,she asked that question of the wild autumn winds 
2205,for it was now october  and wet as usual 
2206,not the archduke  he had married a very great lady and had hunted hares in roumania these many years now  nor mr m 
2207,  he was become a catholic  nor the marquis of c 
2208,  he made sacks in botany bay  nor the lord o 
2209,  he had long been food for fishes 
2210,one way or another  all her old cronies were gone now  and the nells and the kits of drury lane  much though she favoured them  scarcely did to lean upon 
2211, whom   she asked  casting her eyes upon the revolving clouds  clasping her hands as she knelt on the window sill  and looking the very image of appealing womanhood as she did so   can i lean upon  
2212,her words formed themselves  her hands clasped themselves  involuntarily  just as her pen had written of its own accord 
2213,it was not orlando who spoke  but the spirit of the age 
2214,but whichever it was  nobody answered it 
2215,the rooks were tumbling pell mell among the violet clouds of autumn 
2216,the rain had stopped at last and there was an iridescence in the sky which tempted her to put on her plumed hat and her little stringed shoes and stroll out before dinner 
2217, everyone is mated except myself   she mused  as she trailed disconsolately across the courtyard 
2218,there were the rooks  canute and pippin even  transitory as their alliances were  still each this evening seemed to have a partner 
2219, whereas  i  who am mistress of it all   orlando thought  glancing as she passed at the innumerable emblazoned windows of the hall   single  am mateless  am alone  
2220,such thoughts had never entered her head before 
2221,now they bore her down unescapably 
2222,instead of thrusting the gate open  she tapped with a gloved hand for the porter to unfasten it for her 
2223,one must lean on someone  she thought  if it is only on a porter  and half wished to stay behind and help him to grill his chop on a bucket of fiery coals  but was too timid to ask it 
2224,so she strayed out into the park alone  faltering at first and apprehensive lest there might be poachers or gamekeepers or even errand boys to marvel that a great lady should walk alone 
2225,at every step she glanced nervously lest some male form should be hiding behind a furze bush or some savage cow be lowering its horns to toss her 
2226,but there were only the rooks flaunting in the sky 
2227,a steel blue plume from one of them fell among the heather 
2228,she loved wild birds  feathers 
2229,she had used to collect them as a boy 
2230,she picked it up and stuck it in her hat 
2231,the air blew upon her spirit somewhat and revived it 
2232,as the rooks went whirling and wheeling above her head and feather after feather fell gleaming through the purplish air  she followed them  her long cloak floating behind her  over the moor  up the hill 
2233,she had not walked so far for years 
2234,six feathers had she picked from the grass and drawn between her fingers and pressed to her lips to feel their smooth  glinting plumage  when she saw  gleaming on the hill side  a silver pool  mysterious as the lake into which sir bedivere flung the sword of arthur 
2235,a single feather quivered in the air and fell into the middle of it 
2236,then  some strange ecstasy came over her 
2237,some wild notion she had of following the birds to the rim of the world and flinging herself on the spongy turf and there drinking forgetfulness  while the rooks  hoarse laughter sounded over her 
2238,she quickened her pace  she ran  she tripped  the tough heather roots flung her to the ground 
2239,her ankle was broken 
2240,she could not rise 
2241,but there she lay content 
2242,the scent of the bog myrtle and the meadow sweet was in her nostrils 
2243,the rooks  hoarse laughter was in her ears 
2244, i have found my mate   she murmured 
2245, it is the moor  i am nature own bride   she whispered  giving herself in rapture to the cold embraces of the grass as she lay folded in her cloak in the hollow by the pool 
2246, here will i lie   a feather fell upon her brow   i have found a greener laurel than the bay  my forehead will be cool always  these are wild birds  feathers  the owl own  the nightjar own  i shall dream wild dreams  my hands shall wear no wedding ring   she continued  slipping it from her finger   the roots shall twine about them  ah   she sighed  pressing her head luxuriously on its spongy pillow   i have sought happiness through many ages and not found it  fame and missed it  love and not known it  life  and behold  death is better  i have known many men and many women   she continued   none have i understood  it is better that i should lie at peace here with only the sky above me  as the gipsy told me years ago  that was in turkey  
2247,and she looked straight up into the marvellous golden foam into which the clouds had churned themselves  and saw next moment a track in it  and camels passing in single file through the rocky desert among clouds of red dust  and then  when the camels had passed  there were only mountains  very high and full of clefts and with pinnacles of rock  and she fancied she heard goat bells ringing in their passes  and in their folds were fields of irises and gentian 
2248,so the sky changed and her eyes slowly lowered themselves down and down till they came to the rain darkened earth and saw the great hump of the south downs  flowing in one wave along the coast  and where the land parted  there was the sea  the sea with ships passing  and she fancied she heard a gun far out at sea  and thought at first   that is the armada   and then thought  no  it is nelson   and then remembered how those wars were over and the ships were busy merchant ships  and the sails on the winding river were those of pleasure boats 
2249,she saw  too  cattle sprinkled on the dark fields  sheep and cows  and she saw the lights coming here and there in farm house windows  and lanterns moving among the cattle as the shepherd went his rounds and the cowman  and then the lights went out and the stars rose and tangled themselves about the sky 
2250,indeed  she was falling asleep with the wet feathers on her face and her ear pressed to the ground when she heard  deep within  some hammer on an anvil  or was it a heart beating 
2251,tick tock  tick tock  so it hammered  so it beat  the anvil  or the heart in the middle of the earth  until  as she listened  she thought it changed to the trot of a horse own hoofs  one  two  three  four  she counted  then she heard a stumble  then  as it came nearer and nearer  she could hear the crack of a twig and the suck of the wet bog in its hoofs 
2252,the horse was almost on her 
2253,she sat upright 
2254,towering dark against the yellow slashed sky of dawn  with the plovers rising and falling about him  she saw a man on horseback 
2255,he started 
2256,the horse stopped 
2257, madam   the man cried  leaping to the ground   you are hurt  
2258, I am dead  sir   she replied 
2259,a few minutes later  they became engaged 
2260,the morning after  as they sat at breakfast  he told her his name 
2261,it was marmaduke bonthrop shelmerdine  esquire 
2262, i knew it   she said  for there was something romantic and chivalrous  passionate  melancholy  yet determined about him which went with the wild  dark plumed name  a name which had  in her mind  the steel blue gleam of rooks  wings  the hoarse laughter of their caws  the snake like twisting descent of their feathers in a silver pool  and a thousand other things which will be described presently 
2263, mine is orlando   she said 
2264,he had guessed it 
2265,for if you see a ship in full sail coming with the sun on it proudly sweeping across the mediterranean from the south seas  one says at once   orlando   he explained 
2266,in fact  though their acquaintance had been so short  they had guessed  as always happens between lovers  everything of any importance about each other in two seconds at the utmost  and it now remained only to fill in such unimportant details as what they were called  where they lived  and whether they were beggars or people of substance 
2267,he had a castle in the hebrides  but it was ruined  he told her 
2268,gannets feasted in the banqueting hall 
2269,he had been a soldier and a sailor  and had explored the east 
2270,he was on his way now to join his brig at falmouth  but the wind had fallen and it was only when the gale blew from the south west that he could put out to sea 
2271,orlando looked hastily from the breakfast room window at the gilt leopard on the weather vane 
2272,mercifully its tail pointed due east and was steady as a rock 
2273, oh  shel  do not leave me   she cried 
2274, I am passionately in love with you   she said 
2275,no sooner had the words left her mouth than an awful suspicion rushed into both their minds simultaneously 
2276, you are a woman  shel   she cried 
2277, you are a man  orlando   he cried 
2278,never was there such a scene of protestation and demonstration as then took place since the world began 
2279,when it was over and they were seated again she asked him  what was this talk of a south west gale 
2280,where was he bound for 
2281, for the horn   he said briefly  and blushed 
2282, for a man had to blush as a woman had  only at rather different things  
2283,it was only by dint of great pressure on her side and the use of much intuition that she gathered that his life was spent in the most desperate and splendid of adventures  which is to voyage round cape horn in the teeth of a gale 
2284,masts had been snapped off  sails torn to ribbons  she had to drag the admission from him  
2285,sometimes the ship had sunk  and he had been left the only survivor on a raft with a biscuit 
2286, it is about all a fellow can do nowadays   he said sheepishly  and helped himself to great spoonfuls of strawberry jam 
2287,the vision which she had thereupon of this boy  for he was little more  sucking peppermints  for which he had a passion  while the masts snapped and the stars reeled and he roared brief orders to cut this adrift  to heave that overboard  brought the tears to her eyes  tears  she noted  of a finer flavour than any she had cried before   i am a woman   she thought   a real woman  at last  
2288,she thanked bonthrop from the bottom of her heart for having given her this rare and unexpected delight 
2289,had she not been lame in the left foot  she would have sat upon his knee 
2290, ownhel  my darling   she began again   tell me     and so they talked two hours or more  perhaps about cape horn  perhaps not  and really it would profit little to write down what they said  for they knew each other so well that they could say anything  which is tantamount to saying nothing  or saying such stupid  prosy things as how to cook an omelette  or where to buy the best boots in london  things which have no lustre taken from their setting  yet are positively of amazing beauty within it 
2291,for it has come about  by the wise economy of nature  that our modern spirit can almost dispense with language  the commonest expressions do  since no expressions do  hence the most ordinary conversation is often the most poetic  and the most poetic is precisely that which cannot be written down 
2292,for which reasons we leave a great blank here  which must be taken to indicate that the space is filled to repletion 
2293,after some days more of this kind of talk 
2294, orlando  my dearest   shel was beginning  when there was a scuffling outside  and basket the butler entered with the information that there was a couple of peelers downstairs with a warrant from the queen 
2295, ownhow  them up   said shelmerdine briefly  as if on his own quarter deck  taking up  by instinct  a stand with his hands behind him in front of the fireplace 
2296,two officers in bottlegreen uniforms with truncheons at their hips then entered the room and stood at attention 
2297,formalities being over  they gave into orlando own own hands  as their commission was  a legal document of some very impressive sort  judging by the blobs of sealing wax  the ribbons  the oaths  and the signatures  which were all of the highest importance 
2298,orlando ran her eyes through it and then  using the first finger of her right hand as pointer  read out the following facts as being most germane to the matter 
2299, the lawsuits are settled   she read out    ownome in my favour  as for example   others not 
2300,turkish marriage annulled  i was ambassador in constantinople  shel   she explained   children pronounced illegitimate   they said i had three sons by pepita  a spanish dancer   so they do not inherit  which is all to the good   sex  ah  what about sex  my sex   she read out with some solemnity   is pronounced indisputably  and beyond the shadow of a doubt  what i was telling you a moment ago  shel    female  the estates which are now desequestrated in perpetuity descend and are tailed and entailed upon the heirs male of my body  or in default of marriage   but here she grew impatient with this legal verbiage  and said   but there will not be any default of marriage  nor of heirs either  so the rest can be taken as read   whereupon she appended her own signature beneath lord palmerston own and entered from that moment into the undisturbed possession of her titles  her house  and her estate  which was now so much shrunk  for the cost of the lawsuits had been prodigious  that  though she was infinitely noble again  she was also excessively poor 
2301,when the result of the lawsuit was made known  and rumour flew much quicker than the telegraph which has supplanted it   the whole town was filled with rejoicings 
2302,   all of which is properly enclosed in square brackets  as above  for the good reason that a parenthesis it was without any importance in orlando own life 
2303,she skipped it  to get on with the text 
2304,for when the bonfires were blazing in the marketplace  she was in the dark woods with shelmerdine alone 
2305,so fine was the weather that the trees stretched their branches motionless above them  and if a leaf fell  it fell  spotted red and gold  so slowly that one could watch it for half an hour fluttering and falling till it came to rest at last  on orlando own foot 
2306, tell me  mar   she would say  and here it must be explained  that when she called him by the first syllable of his first name  she was in a dreamy  amorous  acquiescent mood  domestic  languid a little  as if spiced logs were burning  and it was evening  yet not time to dress  and a thought wet perhaps outside  enough to make the leaves glisten  but a nightingale might be singing even so among the azaleas  two or three dogs barking at distant farms  a cock crowing  all of which the reader should imagine in her voice    tell me  mar   she would say   about cape horn  
2307,then shelmerdine would make a little model on the ground of the cape with twigs and dead leaves and an empty snail she will or two 
2308, here is the north   he would say 
2309, there is the south  the wind own coming from hereabouts  now the brig is sailing due west  we have just lowered the top boom mizzen  and so you see  here  where this bit of grass is  she enters the current which you will find marked  where is my map and compasses  bo ownun  ah  thanks  that will do  where the snail she will is  the current catches her on the starboard side  so we must rig the jib boom or we shall be carried to the larboard  which is where that beech leaf is   for you must understand my dear    and so he would go on  and she would listen to every word  interpreting them rightly  so as to see  that is to say  without his having to tell her  the phosphorescence on the waves  the icicles clanking in the shrouds  how he went to the top of the mast in a gale  there reflected on the destiny of man  came down again  had a whisky and soda  went on shore  was trapped by a black woman  repented  reasoned it out  read pascal  determined to write philosophy  bought a monkey  debated the true end of life  decided in favour of cape horn  and so on 
2310,all this and a thousand other things she understood him to say  and so when she replied  yes  negresses are seductive  are not they 
2311,he having told her that the supply of biscuits now gave out  he was surprised and delighted to find how well she had taken his meaning 
2312, are you positive you are not a man   he would ask anxiously  and she would echo 
2313, can it be possible you are not a woman   and then they must put it to the proof without more ado 
2314,for each was so surprised at the quickness of the other own sympathy  and it was to each such a revelation that a woman could be as tolerant and free spoken as a man  and a man as strange and subtle as a woman  that they had to put the matter to the proof at once 
2315,and so they would go on talking or rather  understanding  which has become the main art of speech in an age when words are growing daily so scanty in comparison with ideas that  the biscuits ran out  has to stand for kissing a negress in the dark when one has just read bishop berkeley own philosophy for the tenth time 
2316, and from this it follows that only the most profound masters of style can tell the truth  and when one meets a simple one syllable writer  one may conclude  without any doubt at all  that the poor man is lying  
2317,so they would talk  and then  when her feet were fairly covered with spotted autumn leaves  orlando would rise and stroll away into the heart of the woods in solitude  leaving bonthrop sitting there among the snail shells  making models of cape horn 
2318, bonthrop   she would say   I am off   and when she called him by his second name   bonthrop   it should signify to the reader that she was in a solitary mood  felt them both as specks on a desert  was desirous only of meeting death by herself  for people die daily  die at dinner tables  or like this  out of doors in the autumn woods  and with the bonfires blazing and lady palmerston or lady derby asking her out every night to dinner  the desire for death would overcome her  and so saying  bonthrop   she said in effect   I am dead   and pushed her way as a spirit might through the spectre pale beech trees  and so oared herself deep into solitude as if the little flicker of noise and movement were over and she were free now to take her way  all of which the reader should hear in her voice when she said  bonthrop   and should also add  the better to illumine the word  that for him too the same word signified  mystically  separation and isolation and the disembodied pacing the deck of his brig in unfathomable seas 
2319,after some hours of death  suddenly a jay shrieked  ownhelmerdine   and stooping  she picked up one of those autumn crocuses which to some people signify that very word  and put it with the jay own feather that came tumbling blue through the beech woods  in her breast 
2320,then she called  ownhelmerdine  and the word went shooting this way and that way through the woods and struck him where he sat  making models out of snail shells in the grass 
2321,he saw her  and heard her coming to him with the crocus and the jay own feather in her breast  and cried  orlando   which meant  and it must be remembered that when bright colours like blue and yellow mix themselves in our eyes  some of it rubs off on our thoughts  first the bowing and swaying of bracken as if something were breaking through  which proved to be a ship in full sail  heaving and tossing a little dreamily  rather as if she had a whole year of summer days to make her voyage in  and so the ship bears down  heaving this way  heaving that way  nobly  indolently  and rides over the crest of this wave and sinks into the hollow of that one  and so  suddenly stands over you  who are in a little cockle she will of a boat  looking up at her  with all her sails quivering  and then  behold  they drop all of a heap on deck  as orlando dropped now into the grass beside him 
2322,eight or nine days had been spent thus  but on the tenth  which was the th of october  orlando was lying in the bracken  while shelmerdine recited shelley  whose entire works he had by heart   when a leaf which had started to fall slowly enough from a treetop whipped briskly across orlando own foot 
2323,a second leaf followed and then a third 
2324,orlando shivered and turned pale 
2325,it was the wind 
2326,shelmerdine  but it would be more proper now to call him bonthrop  leapt to his feet 
2327, the wind   he cried 
2328,together they ran through the woods  the wind plastering them with leaves as they ran  to the great court and through it and the little courts  frightened servants leaving their brooms and their saucepans to follow after till they reached the chapel  and there a scattering of lights was lit as fast as could be  one knocking over this bench  another snuffing out that taper 
2329,bells were rung 
2330,people were summoned 
2331,at length there was mr dupper catching at the ends of his white tie and asking where was the prayer book 
2332,and they thrust queen mary own prayer book in his hands and he searched  hastily fluttering the pages  and said   marmaduke bonthrop shelmerdine  and lady orlando  kneel down   and they knelt down  and now they were bright and now they were dark as the light and shadow came flying helter skelter through the painted windows  and among the banging of innumerable doors and a sound like brass pots beating  the organ sounded  its growl coming loud and faint alternately  and mr dupper  who was grown a very old man  tried now to raise his voice above the uproar and could not be heard and then all was quiet for a moment  and one word  it might be  the jaws of death   rang out clear  while all the estate servants kept pressing in with rakes and whips still in their hands to listen  and some sang loud and others prayed  and now a bird was dashed against the pane  and now there was a clap of thunder  so that no one heard the word obey spoken or saw  except as a golden flash  the ring pass from hand to hand 
2333,all was movement and confusion 
2334,and up they rose with the organ booming and the lightning playing and the rain pouring  and the lady orlando  with her ring on her finger  went out into the court in her thin dress and held the swinging stirrup  for the horse was bitted and bridled and the foam was still on his flank  for her husband to mount  which he did with one bound  and the horse leapt forward and orlando  standing there  cried out marmaduke bonthrop shelmerdine  and he answered her orlando  and the words went dashing and circling like wild hawks together among the belfries and higher and higher  further and further  faster and faster they circled  till they crashed and fell in a shower of fragments to the ground  and she went in 
2335,orlando went indoors 
2336,it was completely still 
2337,it was very silent 
2338,there was the ink pot  there was the pen  there was the manuscript of her poem  broken off in the middle of a tribute to eternity 
2339,she had been about to say  when basket and bartholomew interrupted with the tea things  nothing changes 
2340,and then  in the space of three seconds and a half  everything had changed  she had broken her ankle  fallen in love  married shelmerdine 
2341,there was the wedding ring on her finger to prove it 
2342,it was true that she had put it there herself before she met shelmerdine  but that had proved worse than useless 
2343,she now turned the ring round and round  with superstitious reverence  taking care lest it should slip past the joint of her finger 
2344, the wedding ring has to be put on the third finger of the left hand   she said  like a child cautiously repeating its lesson   for it to be of any use at all 
2345,she spoke thus  aloud and rather more pompously than was her will not  as if she wished someone whose good opinion she desired to overhear her 
2346,indeed  she had in mind  now that she was at last able to collect her thoughts  the effect that her behaviour would have had upon the spirit of the age 
2347,she was extremely anxious to be informed whether the steps she had taken in the matter of getting engaged to shelmerdine and marrying him met with its approval 
2348,she was certainly feeling more herself 
2349,her finger had not tingled once  or nothing to count  since that night on the moor 
2350,yet  she could not deny that she had her doubts 
2351,she was married  true  but if one own husband was always sailing round cape horn  was it marriage 
2352,if one liked him  was it marriage 
2353,if one liked other people  was it marriage 
2354,and finally  if one still wished  more than anything in the whole world  to write poetry  was it marriage 
2355,she had her doubts 
2356,but she would put it to the test 
2357,she looked at the ring 
2358,she looked at the ink pot 
2359,did she dare 
2360,no  she did not 
2361,but she must 
2362,no  she could not 
2363,what should she do then 
2364,faint  if possible 
2365,but she had never felt better in her life 
2366, hang it all   she cried  with a touch of her old spirit 
2367, here goes  
2368,and she plunged her pen neck deep in the ink 
2369,to her enormous surprise  there was no explosion 
2370,she drew the nib out 
2371,it was wet  but not dripping 
2372,she wrote 
2373,the words were a little long in coming  but come they did 
2374,ah  but did they make sense 
2375,she wondered  a panic coming over her lest the pen might have been at some of its involuntary pranks again 
2376,she read 
2377,and then i came to a field where the springing grass was dulled by the hanging cups of fritillaries  sullen and foreign looking  the snaky flower  scarfed in dull purple  like egyptian girls   
2378,as she wrote she felt some power  remember we are dealing with the most obscure manifestations of the human spirit  reading over her shoulder  and when she had written  egyptian girls   the power told her to stop 
2379,grass  the power seemed to say  going back with a ruler such as governesses use to the beginning  is all right  the hanging cups of fritillaries  admirable  the snaky flower  a thought  strong from a lady own pen  perhaps  but wordsworth no doubt  sanctions it  but  girls 
2380,are girls necessary 
2381,you have a husband at the cape  you say 
2382,ah  well  that will do 
2383,and so the spirit passed on 
2384,orlando now performed in spirit  for all this took place in spirit  a deep obeisance to the spirit of her age  such as  to compare great things with small  a traveller  conscious that he has a bundle of cigars in the corner of his suit case  makes to the customs officer who has obligingly made a scribble of white chalk on the lid 
2385,for she was extremely doubtful whether  if the spirit had examined the contents of her mind carefully  it would not have found something highly contraband for which she would have had to pay the full fine 
2386,she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth 
2387,she had just managed  by some dexterous deference to the spirit of the age  by putting on a ring and finding a man on a moor  by loving nature and being no satirist  cynic  or psychologist  any one of which goods would have been discovered at once  to pass its examination successfully 
2388,and she heaved a deep sigh of relief  as  indeed  well she might  for the transaction between a writer and the spirit of the age is one of infinite delicacy  and upon a nice arrangement between the two the whole fortune of his works depends 
2389,orlando had so ordered it that she was in an extremely happy position  she need neither fight her age  nor submit to it  she was of it  yet remained herself 
2390,now  therefore  she could write  and write she did 
2391,she wrote 
2392,she wrote 
2393,she wrote 
2394,it was now november 
2395,after november  comes december 
2396,then january  february  march  and april 
2397,after april comes may 
2398,june  july  august follow 
2399,next is september 
2400,then october  and so  behold  here we are back at november again  with a whole year accomplished 
2401,this method of writing biography  though it has its merits  is a little bare  perhaps  and the reader  if we go on with it  may complain that he could recite the calendar for himself and so save his pocket whatever sum the hogarth press may think proper to charge for this book 
2402,but what can the biographer do when his subject has put him in the predicament into which orlando has now put us 
2403,life  it has been agreed by everyone whose opinion is worth consulting  is the only fit subject for novelist or biographer  life  the same authorities have decided  has nothing whatever to do with sitting still in a chair and thinking 
2404,thought and life are as the poles asunder 
2405,therefore  since sitting in a chair and thinking is precisely what orlando is doing now  there is nothing for it but to recite the calendar  tell one own beads  blow one own nose  stir the fire  look out of the window  until she has done 
2406,orlando sat so still that you could have heard a pin drop 
2407,would  indeed  that a pin had dropped 
2408,that would have been life of a kind 
2409,or if a butterfly had fluttered through the window and settled on her chair  one could write about that 
2410,or suppose she had got up and killed a wasp 
2411,then  at once  we could out with our pens and write 
2412,for there would be blood she would  if only the blood of a wasp 
2413,where there is blood there is life 
2414,and if killing a wasp is the merest trifle compared with killing a man  still it is a fitter subject for novelist or biographer than this mere wool gathering  this thinking  this sitting in a chair day in  day out  with a cigarette and a sheet of paper and a pen and an ink pot 
2415,if only subjects  we might complain  for our patience is wearing thin   had more consideration for their biographers 
2416,what is more irritating than to see one own subject  on whom one has lavished so much time and trouble  slipping out of one own grasp altogether and indulging  witness her sighs and gasps  her flushing  her palings  her eyes now bright as lamps  now haggard as dawns  what is more humiliating than to see all this dumb show of emotion and excitement gone through before our eyes when we know that what causes it  thought and imagination  are of no importance whatsoever 
2417,but orlando was a woman  lord palmerston had just proved it  and when we are writing the life of a woman  we may  it is agreed  waive our demand for action  and substitute love instead  love  the poet has said  is woman own whole existence  and if we look for a moment at orlando writing at her table  we must admit that never was there a woman more fitted for that calling  surely  since she is a woman  and a beautiful woman  and a woman in the prime of life  she will soon give over this pretence of writing and thinking and begin at least to think of a gamekeeper  and as long as she thinks of a man  nobody objects to a woman thinking   and then she will write him a little note  and as long as she writes little notes nobody objects to a woman writing either  and make an assignation for sunday dusk and sunday dusk will come  and the gamekeeper will whistle under the window  all of which is  of course  the very stuff of life and the only possible subject for fiction 
2418,surely orlando must have done one of these things 
2419,alas   a thousand times  alas  orlando did none of them  must it then be admitted that orlando was one of those monsters of iniquity who do not love  she was kind to dogs  faithful to friends  generosity itself to a dozen starving poets  had a passion for poetry  but love  as the male novelists define it  and who  after all  speak with greater authority   has nothing whatever to do with kindness  fidelity  generosity  or poetry 
2420,love is slipping off one own petticoat and  but we all know what love is 
2421,did orlando do that 
2422,truth compels us to say no  she did not 
2423,if then  the subject of one own biography will neither love nor kill  but will only think and imagine  we may conclude that he or she is no better than a corpse and so leave her 
2424,the only resource now left us is to look out of the window 
2425,there were sparrows  there were starlings  there were a number of doves  and one or two rooks  all occupied after their fashion 
2426,one finds a worm  another a snail 
2427,one flutters to a branch  another takes a little run on the turf 
2428,then a servant crosses the courtyard  wearing a green baize apron 
2429,presumably he is engaged on some intrigue with one of the maids in the pantry  but as no visible proof is offered us  in the courtyard  we can but hope for the best and leave it 
2430,clouds pass  thin or thick  with some disturbance of the colour of the grass beneath 
2431,the sun dial registers the hour in its usual cryptic way 
2432,one own mind begins tossing up a question or two  idly  vainly  about this same life 
2433,life  it sings  or croons rather  like a kettle on a hob 
2434,life  life  what art thou 
2435,light or darkness  the baize apron of the under footman or the shadow of the starling on the grass 
2436,let us go  then  exploring  this summer morning  when all are adoring the plum blossom and the bee 
2437,and humming and hawing  let us ask of the starling  who is a more sociable bird than the lark  what he may think on the brink of the dustbin  whence he picks among the sticks combings of scullion own hair 
2438,what is life  we ask  leaning on the farmyard gate  life  life  life  cries the bird  as if he had heard  and knew precisely  what we meant by this bothering prying habit of ours of asking questions indoors and out and peeping and picking at daisies as the way is of writers when they do not know what to say next 
2439,then they come here  says the bird  and ask me what life is  life  life  life 
2440,we trudge on then by the moor path  to the high brow of the wine blue purple dark hill  and fling ourselves down there  and dream there and see there a grasshopper  carting back to his home in the hollow  a straw 
2441,and he says  if sawings like his can be given a name so sacred and tender  life own labour  or so we interpret the whirr of his dust choked gullet 
2442,and the ant agrees and the bees  but if we lie here long enough to ask the moths  when they come at evening  stealing among the paler heather bells  they will breathe in our ears such wild nonsense as one hears from telegraph wires in snow storms  tee hee  haw haw 
2443,laughter  laughter  the moths say 
2444,having asked then of man and of bird and the insects  for fish  men tell us  who have lived in green caves  solitary for years to hear them speak  never  never say  and so perhaps know what life is  having asked them all and grown no wiser  but only older and colder  for did we not pray once in a way to wrap up in a book something so hard  so rare  one could swear it was life own meaning   back we must go and say straight out to the reader who waits a tiptoe to hear what life is  alas  we do not know 
2445,at this moment  but only just in time to save the book from extinction  orlando pushed away her chair  stretched her arms  dropped her pen  came to the window  and exclaimed   done  
2446,she was almost felled to the ground by the extraordinary sight which now met her eyes 
2447,there was the garden and some birds 
2448,the world was going on as usual 
2449,all the time she was writing the world had continued 
2450, and if i were dead  it would be just the same   she exclaimed 
2451,such was the intensity of her feelings that she could even imagine that she had suffered dissolution  and perhaps some faintness actually attacked her 
2452,for a moment she stood looking at the fair  indifferent spectacle with staring eyes 
2453,at length she was revived in a singular way 
2454,the manuscript which reposed above her heart began shuffling and beating as if it were a living thing  and  what was still odder  and showed how fine a sympathy was between them  orlando  by inclining her head  could make out what it was that it was saying 
2455,it wanted to be read 
2456,it must be read 
2457,it would die in her bosom if it were not read 
2458,for the first time in her life she turned with violence against nature 
2459,elk hounds and rose bushes were about her in profusion 
2460,but elk hounds and rose bushes can none of them read 
2461,it is a lamentable oversight on the part of providence which had never struck her before 
2462,human beings alone are thus gifted 
2463,human beings had become necessary 
2464,she rang the bell 
2465,she ordered the carriage to take her to london at once 
2466, there is just time to catch the eleven forty five  m lady   said basket 
2467,orlando had not yet realized the invention of the steam engine  but such was her absorption in the sufferings of a being  who  though not herself  yet entirely depended on her  that she saw a railway train for the first time  took her seat in a railway carriage  and had the rug arranged about her knees without giving a thought to  that stupendous invention  which had  the historians say  completely changed the face of europe in the past twenty years   as  indeed  happens much more frequently than historians suppose  
2468,she noticed only that it was extremely smutty  rattled horribly  and the windows stuck 
2469,lost in thought  she was whirled up to london in something less than an hour and stood on the platform at charing cross  not knowing where to go 
2470,the old house at blackfriars  where she had spent so many pleasant days in the eighteenth century  was now sold  part to the salvation army  part to an umbrella factory 
2471,she had bought another in mayfair which was sanitary  convenient  and in the heart of the fashionable world  but was it in mayfair that her poem would be relieved of its desire 
2472,pray god  she thought  remembering the brightness of their ladyships  eyes and the symmetry of their lordship own legs  they have not taken to reading there 
2473,for that would be a thousand pities 
2474,then there was lady r 
2475,the same sort of talk would be going on there still  she had no doubt 
2476,the gout might have shifted from the general own left leg to his right  perhaps 
2477,mr l  might have stayed ten days with r  instead of t  then mr pope would come in 
2478,oh  but mr pope was dead 
2479,who were the wits now  she wondered  but that was not a question one could put to a porter  and so she moved on 
2480,her ears were now distracted by the jingling of innumerable bells on the heads of innumerable horses 
2481,fleets of the strangest little boxes on wheels were drawn up by the pavement 
2482,she walked out into the strand 
2483,there the uproar was even worse 
2484,vehicles of all sizes  drawn by blood horses and by dray horses  conveying one solitary dowager or crowded to the top by whiskered men in silk hats  were inextricably mixed 
2485,carriages  carts  and omnibuses seemed to her eyes  so long used to the look of a plain sheet of foolscap  alarmingly at loggerheads  and to her ears  attuned to a pen scratching  the uproar of the street sounded violently and hideously cacophonous 
2486,every inch of the pavement was crowded 
2487,streams of people  threading in and out between their own bodies and the lurching and lumbering traffic with incredible agility  poured incessantly east and west 
2488,along the edge of the pavement stood men  holding out trays of toys  and bawled 
2489,at corners  women sat beside great baskets of spring flowers and bawled 
2490,boys running in and out of the horses  noses  holding printed sheets to their bodies  bawled too  disaster 
2491,disaster 
2492,at first orlando supposed that she had arrived at some moment of national crisis  but whether it was happy or tragic  she could not tell 
2493,she looked anxiously at people own faces 
2494,but that confused her still more 
2495,here would come by a man sunk in despair  muttering to himself as if he knew some terrible sorrow 
2496,past him would nudge a fat  jolly faced fellow  shouldering his way along as if it were a festival for all the world 
2497,indeed  she came to the conclusion that there was neither rhyme nor reason in any of it 
2498,each man and each woman was bent on his own affairs 
2499,and where was she to go 
2500,she walked on without thinking  up one street and down another  by vast windows piled with handbags  and mirrors  and dressing gowns  and flowers  and fishing rods  and luncheon baskets  while stuff of every hue and pattern  thickness or thinness  was looped and festooned and ballooned across and across 
2501,sometimes she passed down avenues of sedate mansions  soberly numbered  one    two    three   and so on right up to two or three hundred  each the copy of the other  with two pillars and six steps and a pair of curtains neatly drawn and family luncheons laid on tables  and a parrot looking out of one window and a man servant out of another  until her mind was dizzied with the monotony 
2502,then she came to great open squares with black shiny  tightly buttoned statues of fat men in the middle  and war horses prancing  and columns rising and fountains falling and pigeons fluttering 
2503,so she walked and walked along pavements between houses until she felt very hungry  and something fluttering above her heart rebuked her with having forgotten all about it 
2504,it was her manuscript 
2505, the oak tree  
2506,she was confounded at her own neglect 
2507,she stopped dead where she stood 
2508,no coach was in sight 
2509,the street  which was wide and handsome  was singularly empty 
2510,only one elderly gentleman was approaching 
2511,there was something vaguely familiar to her in his walk 
2512,as he came nearer  she felt certain that she had met him at some time or other 
2513,but where 
2514,could it be that this gentleman  so neat  so portly  so prosperous  with a cane in his hand and a flower in his button hole  with a pink  plump face  and combed white moustaches  could it be  yes  by jove  it was   her old  her very old friend  nick greene 
2515,at the same time he looked at her  remembered her  recognized her 
2516, the lady orlando   he cried  sweeping his silk hat almost in the dust 
2517, ownir nicholas   she exclaimed 
2518,for she was made aware intuitively by something in his bearing that the scurrilous penny a liner  who had lampooned her and many another in the time of queen elizabeth  was now risen in the world and become certainly a knight and doubtless a dozen other fine things into the bargain 
2519,with another bow  he acknowledged that her conclusion was correct  he was a knight  he was a litt d 
2520,  he was a professor 
2521,he was the author of a score of volumes 
2522,he was  in short  the most influential critic of the victorian age 
2523,a violent tumult of emotion besieged her at meeting the man who had caused her  years ago  so much pain 
2524,could this be the plaguy  restless fellow who had burnt holes in her carpets  and toasted cheese in the italian fireplace and told such merry stories of marlowe and the rest that they had seen the sun rise nine nights out of ten 
2525,he was now sprucely dressed in a grey morning suit  had a pink flower in his button hole  and grey suede gloves to match 
2526,but even as she marvelled  he made another bow  and asked her whether she would honour him by lunching with him 
2527,the bow was a thought overdone perhaps  but the imitation of fine breeding was creditable 
2528,she followed him  wondering  into a superb restaurant  all red plush  white table cloths  and silver cruets  as unlike as could be the old tavern or coffee house with its sanded floor  its wooden benches  its bowls of punch and chocolate  and its broadsheets and spittoons 
2529,he laid his gloves neatly on the table beside him 
2530,still she could hardly believe that he was the same man 
2531,his nails were clean  where they used to be an inch long 
2532,his chin was shaved  where a black beard used to sprout 
2533,he wore gold sleeve links  where his ragged linen used to dip in the broth 
2534,it was not  indeed  until he had ordered the wine  which he did with a care that reminded her of his taste in malmsey long ago  that she was convinced he was the same man 
2535, ah   he said  heaving a little sigh  which was yet comfortable enough   ah  my dear lady  the great days of literature are over  marlowe  shakespeare  ben jonson  those were the giants  dryden  pope  addison  those were the heroes  all  all are dead now  and whom have they left us  tennyson  browning  carlyle    he threw an immense amount of scorn into his voice 
2536, the truth of it is   he said  pouring himself a glass of wine   that all our young writers are in the pay of the booksellers  they turn out any trash that serves to pay their tailor own bills  it is an age   he said  helping himself to hors d oeuvres   marked by precious conceits and wild experiments  none of which the elizabethans would have tolerated for an instant  
2537, no  my dear lady   he continued  passing with approval the turbot au gratin  which the waiter exhibited for his sanction   the great days are over  we live in degenerate times  we must cherish the past  honour those writers  there are still a few left of  them  who take antiquity for their model and write  not for pay but    here orlando almost shouted  glawr   indeed she could have sworn that she had heard him say the very same things three hundred years ago  the names were different  of course  but the spirit was the same  nick greene had not changed  for all his knighthood  and yet  some change there was  for while he ran on about taking addison as one own model  it had been cicero once  she thought  and lying in bed of a morning  which she was proud to think her pension paid quarterly enabled him to do  rolling the best works of the best authors round and round on one own tongue for an hour  at least  before setting pen to paper  so that the vulgarity of the present time and the deplorable condition of our native tongue  he had lived long in america  she believed  might be purified  while he ran on in much the same way that greene had run on three hundred years ago  she had time to ask herself  how was it then that he had changed 
2538,he had grown plump  but he was a man verging on seventy 
2539,he had grown sleek  literature had been a prosperous pursuit evidently  but somehow the old restless  uneasy vivacity had gone 
2540,his stories  brilliant as they were  were no longer quite so free and easy 
2541,he mentioned  it is true   my dear friend pope  or  my illustrious friend addison  every other second  but he had an air of respectability about him which was depressing  and he preferred  it seemed  to enlighten her about the doings and sayings of her own blood relations rather than tell her  as he used to do  scandal about the poets 
2542,orlando was unaccountably disappointed 
2543,she had thought of literature all these years  her seclusion  her rank  her sex must be her excuse  as something wild as the wind  hot as fire  swift as lightning  something errant  incalculable  abrupt  and behold  literature was an elderly gentleman in a grey suit talking about duchesses 
2544,the violence of her disillusionment was such that some hook or button fastening the upper part of her dress burst open  and out upon the table fell  the oak tree   a poem 
2545, a manuscript   said sir nicholas  putting on his gold pince nez 
2546, how interesting  how excessively interesting  permit me to look at it  
2547,and once more  after an interval of some three hundred years  nicholas greene took orlando own poem and  laying it down among the coffee cups and the liqueur glasses  began to read it 
2548,but now his verdict was very different from what it had been then 
2549,it reminded him  he said as he turned over the pages  of addison own  cato  
2550,it compared favourably with thomson own  seasons  
2551,there was no trace in it  he was thankful to say  of the modern spirit 
2552,it was composed with a regard to truth  to nature  to the dictates of the human heart  which was rare indeed  in these days of unscrupulous eccentricity 
2553,it must  of course  be published instantly 
2554,really orlando did not know what he meant 
2555,she had always carried her manuscripts about with her in the bosom of her dress 
2556,the idea tickled sir nicholas considerably 
2557, but what about royalties   he asked 
2558,orlando own mind flew to buckingham palace and some dusky potentates who happened to be staying there 
2559,sir nicholas was highly diverted 
2560,he explained that he was alluding to the fact that messrs     here he mentioned a well known firm of publishers  would be delighted  if he wrote them a line  to put the book on their list 
2561,he could probably arrange for a royalty of ten per cent on all copies up to two thousand  after that it would be fifteen 
2562,as for the reviewers  he would himself write a line to mr     who was the most influential  then a compliment  say a little puff of her own poems  addressed to the wife of the editor of the    never did any harm 
2563,he would call    
2564,so he ran on 
2565,orlando understood nothing of all this  and from old experience did not altogether trust his good nature  but there was nothing for it but to submit to what was evidently his wish and the fervent desire of the poem itself 
2566,so sir nicholas made the blood stained packet into a neat parcel  flattened it into his breast pocket  lest it should disturb the set of his coat  and with many compliments on both sides  they parted 
2567,orlando walked up the street 
2568,now that the poem was gone   and she felt a bare place in her breast where she had been used to carry it  she had nothing to do but reflect upon whatever she liked  the extraordinary chances it might be of the human lot  here she was in st james own street  a married woman  with a ring on her finger  where there had been a coffee house once there was now a restaurant  it was about half past three in the afternoon  the sun was shining  there were three pigeons  a mongrel terrier dog  two hansom cabs and a barouche landau  what then  was life  the thought popped into her head violently  irrelevantly  unless old greene were somehow the because of it   and it may be taken as a comment  adverse or favourable  as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband  who was at the horn   that whenever anything popped violently into her head  she went straight to the nearest telegraph office and wired to him  there was one  as it happened  close at hand   my god shel   she wired   life literature greene toady    here she dropped into a cypher language which they had invented between them so that a whole spiritual state of the utmost complexity might be conveyed in a word or two without the telegraph clerk being any wiser  and added the words  rattigan glumphoboo   which summed it up precisely 
2569,for not only had the events of the morning made a deep impression on her  but it cannot have escaped the reader own attention that orlando was growing up  which is not necessarily growing better  and  rattigan glumphoboo  described a very complicated spiritual state  which if the reader puts all his intelligence at our service he may discover for himself 
2570,there could be no answer to her telegram for some hours  indeed  it was probable  she thought  glancing at the sky  where the upper clouds raced swiftly past  that there was a gale at cape horn  so that her husband would be at the mast head  as likely as not  or cutting away some tattered spar  or even alone in a boat with a biscuit 
2571,and so  leaving the post office  she turned to beguile herself into the next shop  which was a shop so common in our day that it needs no description  yet  to her eyes  strange in the extreme  a shop where they sold books 
2572,all her life long orlando had known manuscripts  she had held in her hands the rough brown sheets on which spenser had written in his little crabbed hand  she had seen shakespeare own script and milton own 
2573,she owned  indeed  a fair number of quartos and folios  often with a sonnet in her praise in them and sometimes a lock of hair 
2574,but these innumerable little volumes  bright  identical  ephemeral  for they seemed bound in cardboard and printed on tissue paper  surprised her infinitely 
2575,the whole works of shakespeare cost half a crown  and could be put in your pocket 
2576,one could hardly read them  indeed  the print was so small  but it was a marvel  none the less 
2577, works   the works of every writer she had known or heard of and many more stretched from end to end of the long shelves 
2578,on tables and chairs  more  works  were piled and tumbled  and these she saw  turning a page or two  were often works about other works by sir nicholas and a score of others whom  in her ignorance  she supposed  since they were bound and printed  to be very great writers too 
2579,so she gave an astounding order to the bookseller to send her everything of any importance in the shop and left 
2580,she turned into hyde park  which she had known of old  beneath that cleft tree  she remembered  the duke of hamilton fell run through the body by lord mohun   and her lips  which are often to blame in the matter  began framing the words of her telegram into a senseless singsong  life literature greene toady rattigan glumphoboo  so that several park keepers looked at her with suspicion and were only brought to a favourable opinion of her sanity by noticing the pearl necklace which she wore 
2581,she had carried off a sheaf of papers and critical journals from the book shop  and at length  flinging herself on her elbow beneath a tree  she spread these pages round her and did her best to fathom the noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it 
2582,for still the old credulity was alive in her  even the blurred type of a weekly newspaper had some sanctity in her eyes 
2583,so she read  lying on her elbow  an article by sir nicholas on the collected works of a man she had once known  john donne  but she had pitched herself  without knowing it  not far from the serpentine  the barking of a thousand dogs sounded in her ears  carriage wheels rushed ceaselessly in a circle  leaves sighed overhead  now and again a braided skirt and a pair of tight scarlet trousers crossed the grass within a few steps of her  once a gigantic rubber ball bounced on the newspaper  violets  oranges  reds  and blues broke through the interstices of the leaves and sparkled in the emerald on her finger  she read a sentence and looked up at the sky  she looked up at the sky and looked down at the newspaper  life  literature  one to be made into the other  but how monstrously difficult  for  here came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers  how would addison have put that  here came two dogs dancing on their hind legs  how would lamb have described that  for reading sir nicholas and his friends  as she did in the intervals of looking about her   she somehow got the impression  here she rose and walked  they made one feel  it was an extremely uncomfortable feeling  one must never  never say what one thought 
2584, she stood on the banks of the serpentine  it was a bronze colour  spider thin boats were skimming from side to side  
2585,they made one feel  she continued  that one must always  always write like somebody else 
2586, the tears formed themselves in her eyes  
2587,for really  she thought  pushing a little boat off with her toe  i do not think i could  here the whole of sir nicholas  article came before her as articles do  ten minutes after they are read  with the look of his room  his head  his cat  his writing table  and the time of the day thrown in   i do not think i could  she continued  considering the article from this point of view  sit in a study  no  it is not a study  it is a mouldy kind of drawing room  all day long  and talk to pretty young men  and tell them little anecdotes  which they must not repeat  about what tupper said about smiles  and then  she continued  weeping bitterly  they are all so manly  and then  i do detest duchesses  and i do not like cake  and though I am spiteful enough  i could never learn to be as spiteful as all that  so how can i be a critic and write the best english prose of my time 
2588,damn it all  she exclaimed  launching a penny steamer so vigorously that the poor little boat almost sank in the bronze coloured waves 
2589,now  the truth is that when one has been in a state of mind  as nurses call it   and the tears still stood in orlando own eyes  the thing one is looking at becomes  not itself  but another thing  which is bigger and much more important and yet remains the same thing 
2590,if one looks at the serpentine in this state of mind  the waves soon become just as big as the waves on the atlantic  the toy boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners 
2591,so orlando mistook the toy boat for her husband own brig  and the wave she had made with her toe for a mountain of water off cape horn  and as she watched the toy boat climb the ripple  she thought she saw bonthrop own ship climb up and up a glassy wall  up and up it went  and a white crest with a thousand deaths in it arched over it  and through the thousand deaths it went and disappeared   it is sunk   she cried out in an agony  and then  behold  there it was again sailing along safe and sound among the ducks on the other side of the atlantic 
2592, ecstasy   she cried 
2593, ecstasy  where is the post office   she wondered 
2594, for i must wire at once to shel and tell him    
2595,and repeating  a toy boat on the serpentine   and  ecstasy   alternately  for the thoughts were interchangeable and meant exactly the same thing  she hurried towards park lane 
2596, a toy boat  a toy boat  a toy boat   she repeated  thus enforcing upon herself the fact that it is not articles by nick greene on john donne nor eight hour bills nor covenants nor factory acts that matter  it is something useless  sudden  violent  something that costs a life  red  blue  purple  a spirit  a splash  like those hyacinths  she was passing a fine bed of them   free from taint  dependence  soilure of humanity or care for one own kind  something rash  ridiculous  like my hyacinth  husband i mean  bonthrop  that is what it is  a toy boat on the serpentine  ecstasy  it is ecstasy that matters 
2597,thus she spoke aloud  waiting for the carriages to pass at stanhope gate  for the consequence of not living with one own husband  except when the wind is sunk  is that one talks nonsense aloud in park lane 
2598,it would no doubt have been different had she lived all the year round with him as queen victoria recommended 
2599,as it was the thought of him would come upon her in a flash 
2600,she found it absolutely necessary to speak to him instantly 
2601,she did not care in the least what nonsense it might make  or what dislocation it might inflict on the narrative 
2602,nick greene own article had plunged her in the depths of despair  the toy boat had raised her to the heights of joy 
2603,so she repeated   ecstasy  ecstasy   as she stood waiting to cross 
2604,but the traffic was heavy that spring afternoon  and kept her standing there  repeating  ecstasy  ecstasy  or a toy boat on the serpentine  while the wealth and power of england sat  as if sculptured  in hat and cloak  in four in hand  victoria and barouche landau 
2605,it was as if a golden river had coagulated and massed itself in golden blocks across park lane 
2606,the ladies held card cases between their fingers  the gentlemen balanced gold mounted canes between their knees 
2607,she stood there gazing  admiring  awe struck 
2608,one thought only disturbed her  a thought familiar to all who behold great elephants  or whales of an incredible magnitude  and that is  how do these leviathans to whom obviously stress  change  and activity are repugnant  propagate their kind 
2609,perhaps  orlando thought  looking at the stately  still faces  their time of propagation is over  this is the fruit  this is the consummation 
2610,what she now beheld was the triumph of an age 
2611,portly and splendid there they sat 
2612,but now  the policeman let fall his hand  the stream became liquid  the massive conglomeration of splendid objects moved  dispersed  and disappeared into piccadilly 
2613,so she crossed park lane and went to her house in curzon street  where  when the meadow sweet blew there  she could remember curlew calling and one very old man with a gun 
2614,she could remember  she thought  stepping across the threshold of her house  how lord chesterfield had said  but her memory was checked 
2615,her discreet eighteenth century hall  where she could see lord chesterfield putting his hat down here and his coat down there with an elegance of deportment which it was a pleasure to watch  was now completely littered with parcels 
2616,while she had been sitting in hyde park the bookseller had delivered her order  and the house was crammed  there were parcels slipping down the staircase  with the whole of victorian literature done up in grey paper and neatly tied with string 
2617,she carried as many of these packets as she could to her room  ordered footmen to bring the others  and  rapidly cutting innumerable strings  was soon surrounded by innumerable volumes 
2618,accustomed to the little literatures of the sixteenth  seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries  orlando was appalled by the consequences of her order 
2619,for  of course  to the victorians themselves victorian literature meant not merely four great names separate and distinct but four great names sunk and embedded in a mass of alexander smiths  dixons  blacks  milmans  buckles  taines  paynes  tuppers  jamesons  all vocal  clamorous  prominent  and requiring as much attention as anybody else 
2620,orlando own reverence for print had a tough job set before it but drawing her chair to the window to get the benefit of what light might filter between the high houses of mayfair  she tried to come to a conclusion 
2621,and now it was clear that there are only two ways of coming to a conclusion upon victorian literature  one is to write it out in sixty volumes octavo  the other is to squeeze it into six lines of the length of this one 
2622,of the two courses  economy  since time runs short  leads us to choose the second  and so we proceed 
2623,orlando then came to the conclusion  opening half a dozen books  that it was very odd that there was not a single dedication to a nobleman among them  next  turning over a vast pile of memoirs  that several of these writers had family trees half as high as her own  next  that it would be impolitic in the extreme to wrap a ten pound note round the sugar tongs when miss christina rossetti came to tea  next  here were half a dozen invitations to celebrate centenaries by dining  that literature since it ate all these dinners must be growing very corpulent  next  she was invited to a score of lectures on the influence of this upon that  the classical revival  the romantic survival  and other titles of the same engaging kind  that literature since it listened to all these lectures must be growing very dry  next  here she attended a reception given by a peeress  that literature since it wore all those fur tippets must be growing very respectable  next  here she visited carlyle own sound proof room at chelsea  that genius since it needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate  and so at last she reached her final conclusion  which was of the highest importance but which  as we have already much overpassed our limit of six lines  we must omit 
2624,orlando  having come to this conclusion  stood looking out of the window for a considerable space of time 
2625,for  when anybody comes to a conclusion it is as if they had tossed the ball over the net and must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them 
2626,what would be sent her next from the colourless sky above chesterfield house  she wondered 
2627,and with her hands clasped  she stood for a considerable space of time wondering 
2628,suddenly she started  and here we could only wish that  as on a former occasion  purity  chastity  and modesty would push the door ajar and provide  at least  a breathing space in which we could think how to wrap up what now has to be told delicately  as a biographer should  but no  having thrown their white garment at the naked orlando and seen it fall short by several inches  these ladies had given up all intercourse with her these many years  and were now otherwise engaged  is nothing then  going to happen this pale march morning to mitigate  to veil  to cover  to conceal  to shroud this undeniable event whatever it may be  for after giving that sudden  violent start  orlando  but heaven be praised  at this very moment there struck up outside one of these frail  reedy  fluty  jerky  old fashioned barrel organs which are still sometimes played by italian organ grinders in back streets 
2629,let us accept the intervention  humble though it is  as if it were the music of the spheres  and allow it  with all its gasps and groans  to fill this page with sound until the moment comes when it is impossible to deny its coming  which the footman has seen coming and the maid servant  and the reader will have to see too  for orlando herself is clearly unable to ignore it any longer  let the barrel organ sound and transport us on thought  which is no more than a little boat  when music sounds  tossing on the waves  on thought  which is  of all carriers  the most clumsy  the most erratic  over the roof tops and the back gardens where washing is hanging to  what is this place 
2630,do you recognize the green and in the middle the steeple  and the gate with a lion couchant on either side 
2631,oh yes  it is kew 
2632,well  kew will do 
2633,so here we are at kew  and i will show you to day  the second of march  under the plum tree  a grape hyacinth  and a crocus  and a bud  too  on the almond tree  so that to walk there is to be thinking of bulbs  hairy and red  thrust into the earth in october  flowering now  and to be dreaming of more than can rightly be said  and to be taking from its case a cigarette or cigar even  and to be flinging a cloak under  as the rhyme requires  an oak  and there to sit  waiting the kingfisher  which  it is said  was seen once to cross in the evening from bank to bank 
2634,wait 
2635,wait 
2636,the kingfisher comes  the kingfisher comes not 
2637,behold  meanwhile  the factory chimneys and their smoke  behold the city clerks flashing by in their outrigger 
2638,behold the old lady taking her dog for a walk and the servant girl wearing her new hat for the first time not at the right angle 
2639,behold them all 
2640,though heaven has mercifully decreed that the secrets of all hearts are hidden so that we are lured on for ever to suspect something  perhaps  that does not exist  still through our cigarette smoke  we see blaze up and salute the splendid fulfilment of natural desires for a hat  for a boat  for a rat in a ditch  as once one saw blazing  such silly hops and skips the mind takes when it slops like this all over the saucer and the barrel organ plays  saw blazing a fire in a field against minarets near constantinople 
2641,hail  natural desire 
2642,hail  happiness  divine happiness  and pleasure of all sorts  flowers and wine  though one fades and the other intoxicates  and half crown tickets out of london on sundays  and singing in a dark chapel hymns about death  and anything  anything that interrupts and confounds the tapping of typewriters and filing of letters and forging of links and chains  binding the empire together 
2643,hail even the crude  red bows on shop girls  lips  as if cupid  very clumsily  dipped his thumb in red ink and scrawled a token in passing  
2644,hail  happiness  kingfisher flashing from bank to bank  and all fulfilment of natural desire  whether it is what the male novelist says it is  or prayer  or denial  hail  in whatever form it comes  and may there be more forms  and stranger 
2645,for dark flows the stream  would it were true  as the rhyme hints  like a dream   but duller and worser than that is our usual lot  without dreams  but alive  smug  fluent  habitual  under trees whose shade of an olive green drowns the blue of the wing of the vanishing bird when he darts of a sudden from bank to bank 
2646,hail  happiness  then  and after happiness  hail not those dreams which bloat the sharp image as spotted mirrors do the face in a country inn parlour  dreams which splinter the whole and tear us asunder and wound us and split us apart in the night when we would sleep  but sleep  sleep  so deep that all shapes are ground to dust of infinite softness  water of dimness inscrutable  and there  folded  shrouded  like a mummy  like a moth  prone let us lie on the sand at the bottom of sleep 
2647,but wait  but wait  we are not going  this time  visiting the blind land 
2648,blue  like a match struck right in the ball of the innermost eye  he flies  burns  bursts the seal of sleep  the kingfisher  so that now floods back refluent like a tide  the red  thick stream of life again  bubbling  dripping  and we rise  and our eyes  for how handy a rhyme is to pass us safe over the awkward transition from death to life  fall on   here the barrel organ stops playing abruptly  
2649, it is a very fine boy  m lady   said mrs banting  the midwife  putting her first born child into orlando own arms 
2650,in other words orlando was safely delivered of a son on thursday  march the th  at three of the clock in the morning 
2651,once more orlando stood at the window  but let the reader take courage  nothing of the same sort is going to happen to day  which is not  by any means  the same day 
2652,no  for if we look out of the window  as orlando was doing at the moment  we shall see that park lane itself has considerably changed  indeed one might stand there ten minutes or more  as orlando stood now  without seeing a single barouche landau   look at that   she exclaimed  some days later when an absurd truncated carriage without any horses began to glide about of its own accord  a carriage without any horses indeed  she was called away just as she said that  but came back again after a time and had another look out of the window  it was odd sort of weather nowadays  the sky itself  she could not help thinking  had changed  it was no longer so thick  so watery  so prismatic now that king edward  see  there he was  stepping out of his neat brougham to go and visit a certain lady opposite  had succeeded queen victoria  the clouds had shrunk to a thin gauze  the sky seemed made of metal  which in hot weather tarnished verdigris  copper colour or orange as metal does in a fog  it was a little alarming  this shrinkage 
2653,everything seemed to have shrunk 
2654,driving past buckingham palace last night  there was not a trace of that vast erection which she had thought everlasting  top hats  widows  weeds  trumpets  telescopes  wreaths  all had vanished and left not a stain  not a puddle even  on the pavement 
2655,but it was now  after another interval she had come back again to her favourite station in the window  now  in the evening  that the change was most remarkable 
2656,look at the lights in the houses 
2657,at a touch  a whole room was lit  hundreds of rooms were lit  and one was precisely the same as the other 
2658,one could see everything in the little square shaped boxes  there was no privacy  none of those lingering shadows and odd corners that there used to be  none of those women in aprons carrying wobbly lamps which they put down carefully on this table and on that 
2659,at a touch  the whole room was bright 
2660,and the sky was bright all night long  and the pavements were bright  everything was bright 
2661,she came back again at mid day 
2662,how narrow women have grown lately 
2663,they looked like stalks of corn  straight  shining  identical 
2664,and men own faces were as bare as the palm of one own hand 
2665,the dryness of the atmosphere brought out the colour in everything and seemed to stiffen the muscles of the cheeks 
2666,it was harder to cry now 
2667,water was hot in two seconds 
2668,ivy had perished or been scraped off houses 
2669,vegetables were less fertile  families were much smaller 
2670,curtains and covers had been frizzled up and the walls were bare so that new brilliantly coloured pictures of real things like streets  umbrellas  apples  were hung in frames  or painted upon the wood 
2671,there was something definite and distinct about the age  which reminded her of the eighteenth century  except that there was a distraction  a desperation  as she was thinking this  the immensely long tunnel in which she seemed to have been travelling for hundreds of years widened  the light poured in  her thoughts became mysteriously tightened and strung up as if a piano tuner had put his key in her back and stretched the nerves very taut  at the same time her hearing quickened  she could hear every whisper and crackle in the room so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a hammer 
2672,and so for some seconds the light went on becoming brighter and brighter  and she saw everything more and more clearly and the clock ticked louder and louder until there was a terrific explosion right in her ear 
2673,orlando leapt as if she had been violently struck on the head 
2674,ten times she was struck 
2675,in fact it was ten of the clock in the morning 
2676,it was the eleventh of october 
2677,it was  
2678,it was the present moment 
2679,no one need wonder that orlando started  pressed her hand to her heart  and turned pale 
2680,for what more terrifying revelation can there be than that it is the present moment 
2681,that we survive the shock at all is only possible because the past shelters us on one side and the future on another 
2682,but we have no time now for reflections  orlando was terribly late already 
2683,she ran downstairs  she jumped into her motorcar  she pressed the self starter and was off 
2684,vast blue blocks of building rose into the air  the red cowls of chimneys were spotted irregularly across the sky  the road shone like silver headed nails  omnibuses bore down upon her with sculptured white faced drivers  she noticed sponges  bird cages  boxes of green american cloth 
2685,but she did not allow these sights to sink into her mind even the fraction of an inch as she crossed the narrow plank of the present  lest she should fall into the raging torrent beneath 
2686, why do not you look where you are going to    put your hand out  cannot you    that was all she said sharply  as if the words were jerked out of her 
2687,for the streets were immensely crowded  people crossed without looking where they were going 
2688,people buzzed and hummed round the plate glass windows within which one could see a glow of red  a blaze of yellow  as if they were bees  orlando thought  but her thought that they were bees was violently snipped off and she saw  regaining perspective with one flick of her eye  that they were bodies 
2689, why do not you look where you are going   she snapped out 
2690,at last  however  she drew up at marshall   snelgrove own and went into the shop 
2691,shade and scent enveloped her 
2692,the present fell from her like drops of scalding water 
2693,light swayed up and down like thin stuffs puffed out by a summer breeze 
2694,she took a list from her bag and began reading in a curious stiff voice at first  as if she were holding the words  boy own boots  bath salts  sardines  under a tap of many coloured water 
2695,she watched them change as the light fell on them 
2696,bath and boots became blunt  obtuse  sardines serrated itself like a saw 
2697,so she stood in the ground floor department of messrs marshall   snelgrove  looked this way and that  snuffed this smell and that and thus wasted some seconds 
2698,then she got into the lift  for the good reason that the door stood open  and was shot smoothly upwards 
2699,the very fabric of life now  she thought as she rose  is magic 
2700,in the eighteenth century we knew how everything was done  but here i rise through the air  i listen to voices in america  i see men flying  but how its done i cannot even begin to wonder  so my belief in magic returns  now the lift gave a little jerk as it stopped at the first floor  and she had a vision of innumerable coloured stuffs flaunting in a breeze from which came distinct  strange smells  and each time the lift stopped and flung its doors open  there was another slice of the world displayed with all the smells of that world clinging to it  she was reminded of the river off wapping in the time of elizabeth  where the treasure ships and the merchant ships used to anchor  how richly and curiously they had smelt  how well she remembered the feel of rough rubies running through her fingers when she dabbled them in a treasure sack  and then lying with sukey  or whatever her name was  and having cumberland own lantern flashed on them  the cumberlands had a house in portland place now and she had lunched with them the other day and ventured a little joke with the old man about almshouses in the sheen road  he had winked  but here as the lift could go no higher  she must get out  heaven knows into what  department  as they called it 
2701,she stood still to consult her shopping list  but was blessed if she could see  as the list bade her  bath salts  or boy own boots anywhere about 
2702,and indeed  she was about to descend again  without buying anything  but was saved from that outrage by saying aloud automatically the last item on her list  which happened to be  ownheets for a double bed  
2703, ownheets for a double bed   she said to a man at a counter and  by a dispensation of providence  it was sheets that the man at that particular counter happened to sell 
2704,for grimsditch  no  grimsditch was dead  bartholomew  no  bartholomew was dead  louise then  louise had come to her in a great taking the other day  for she had found a hole in the bottom of the sheet in the royal bed  many kings and queens had slept there  elizabeth  james  charles  george  victoria  edward  no wonder the sheet had a hole in it 
2705,but louise was positive she knew who had done it 
2706,it was the prince consort 
2707, ownale bosch   she said  for there had been another war  this time against the germans  
2708, ownheets for a double bed   orlando repeated dreamily  for a double bed with a silver counterpane in a room fitted in a taste which she now thought perhaps a little vulgar  all in silver  but she had furnished it when she had a passion for that metal 
2709,while the man went to get sheets for a double bed  she took out a little looking glass and a powder puff 
2710,women were not nearly as roundabout in their ways  she thought  powdering herself with the greatest unconcern  as they had been when she herself first turned woman and lay on the deck of the  enamoured lady  
2711,she gave her nose the right tint deliberately 
2712,she never touched her cheeks 
2713,honestly  though she was now thirty six  she scarcely looked a day older 
2714,she looked just as pouting  as sulky  as handsome  as rosy  like a million candled christmas tree  sasha had said  as she had done that day on the ice  when the thames was frozen and they had gone skating  
2715, the best irish linen  madam   said the shopman  spreading the sheets on the counter   and they had met an old woman picking up sticks 
2716,here  as she was fingering the linen abstractedly  one of the swing doors between the departments opened and let through  perhaps from the fancy goods department  a whiff of scent  waxen  tinted as if from pink candles  and the scent curved like a she will round a figure  was it a boy own or was it a girl own  young  slender  seductive  a girl  by god  furred  pearled  in russian trousers  but faithless  faithless 
2717, faithless   cried orlando  the man had gone  and all the shop seemed to pitch and toss with yellow water and far off she saw the masts of the russian ship standing out to sea  and then  miraculously  perhaps the door opened again  the conch which the scent had made became a platform  a dais  off which stepped a fat  furred woman  marvellously well preserved  seductive  diademed  a grand duke own mistress  she who  leaning over the banks of the volga  eating sandwiches  had watched men drown  and began walking down the shop towards her 
2718, oh sasha  
2719,orlando cried 
2720,really  she was shocked that she should have come to this  she had grown so fat  so lethargic  and she bowed her head over the linen so that this apparition of a grey woman in fur  and a girl in russian trousers  with all these smells of wax candles  white flowers  and old ships that it brought with it might pass behind her back unseen 
2721, any napkins  towels  dusters today  madam   the shopman persisted 
2722,and it is enormously to the credit of the shopping list  which orlando now consulted  that she was able to reply with every appearance of composure  that there was only one thing in the world she wanted and that was bath salts  which was in another department 
2723,but descending in the lift again  so insidious is the repetition of any scene  she was again sunk far beneath the present moment  and thought when the lift bumped on the ground  that she heard a pot broken against a river bank 
2724,as for finding the right department  whatever it might be  she stood engrossed among the handbags  deaf to the suggestions of all the polite  black  combed  sprightly shop assistants  who descending as they did equally and some of them  perhaps  as proudly  even from such depths of the past as she did  chose to let down the impervious screen of the present so that today they appeared shop assistants in marshall   snelgrove own merely 
2725,orlando stood there hesitating 
2726,through the great glass doors she could see the traffic in oxford street 
2727,omnibus seemed to pile itself upon omnibus and then to jerk itself apart 
2728,so the ice blocks had pitched and tossed that day on the thames 
2729,an old nobleman  in furred slippers had sat astride one of them  there he went  she could see him now  calling down maledictions upon the irish rebels 
2730,he had sunk there  where her car stood 
2731, time has passed over me   she thought  trying to collect herself   this is the oncome of middle age  how strange it is  nothing is any longer one thing  i take up a handbag and i think of an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice  someone lights a pink candle and i see a girl in russian trousers  when i step out of doors  as i do now   here she stepped on to the pavement of oxford street   what is it that i taste  little herbs  i hear goat bells  i see mountains  turkey  india  persia  
2732,her eyes filled with tears 
2733,that orlando had gone a little too far from the present moment will  perhaps  strike the reader who sees her now preparing to get into her motor car with her eyes full of tears and visions of persian mountains 
2734,and indeed  it cannot be denied that the most successful practitioners of the art of life  often unknown people by the way  somehow contrive to synchronize the sixty or seventy different times which beat simultaneously in every normal human system so that when eleven strikes  all the rest chime in unison  and the present is neither a violent disruption nor completely forgotten in the past 
2735,of them we can justly say that they live precisely the sixty eight or seventy two years allotted them on the tombstone 
2736,of the rest some we know to be dead though they walk among us  some are not yet born though they go through the forms of life  others are hundreds of years old though they call themselves thirty six 
2737,the true length of a person own life  whatever the  dictionary of national biography  may say  is always a matter of dispute 
2738,for it is a difficult business  this time keeping  nothing more quickly disorders it than contact with any of the arts  and it may have been her love of poetry that was to blame for making orlando lose her shopping list and start home without the sardines  the bath salts  or the boots 
2739,now as she stood with her hand on the door of her motor car  the present again struck her on the head 
2740,eleven times she was violently assaulted 
2741, confound it all   she cried  for it is a great shock to the nervous system  hearing a clock strike  so much so that for some time now there is nothing to be said of her save that she frowned slightly  changed her gears admirably  and cried out  as before   look where you are going    do not you know your own mind    why did not you say so then   while the motor car shot  swung  squeezed  and slid  for she was an expert driver  down regent street  down haymarket  down northumberland avenue  over westminster bridge  to the left  straight on  to the right  straight on again   
2742,the old kent road was very crowded on thursday  the eleventh of october  
2743,people spilt off the pavement 
2744,there were women with shopping bags 
2745,children ran out 
2746,there were sales at drapers  shops 
2747,streets widened and narrowed 
2748,long vistas steadily shrunk together 
2749,here was a market 
2750,here a funeral 
2751,here a procession with banners upon which was written  ra  un   but what else  meat was very red  butchers stood at the door  women almost had their heels sliced off  amor vin   that was over a porch 
2752,a woman looked out of a bedroom window  profoundly contemplative  and very still 
2753,applejohn and applebed  undert    nothing could be seen whole or read from start to finish  what was seen begun  like two friends starting to meet each other across the street  was never seen ended 
2754,after twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of torn paper tumbling from a sack and  indeed  the process of motoring fast out of london so much resembles the chopping up small of identity which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself that it is an open question in what sense orlando can be said to have existed at the present moment 
2755,indeed we should have given her over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here  at last  one green screen was held out on the right  against which the little bits of paper fell more slowly  and then another was held out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now turning over by themselves in the air  and then green screens were held continuously on either side  so that her mind regained the illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage  a farmyard and four cows  all precisely life size 
2756,when this happened  orlando heaved a sigh of relief  lit a cigarette  and puffed for a minute or two in silence 
2757,then she called hesitatingly  as if the person she wanted might not be there   orlando 
2758,for if there are  at a venture  seventy six different times all ticking in the mind at once  how many different people are there not  heaven help us  all having lodgment at one time or another in the human spirit 
2759,some say two thousand and fifty two 
2760,so that it is the most usual thing in the world for a person to call  directly they are alone  orlando 
2761, if that is one own name  meaning by that  come  come 
2762,I am sick to death of this particular self 
2763,i want another 
2764,hence  the astonishing changes we see in our friends 
2765,but it is not altogether plain sailing  either  for though one may say  as orlando said  being out in the country and needing another self presumably  orlando 
2766,still the orlando she needs may not come  these selves of which we are built up  one on top of another  as plates are piled on a waiter own hand  have attachments elsewhere  sympathies  little constitutions and rights of their own  call them what you will  and for many of these things there is no name  so that one will only come if it is raining  another in a room with green curtains  another when mrs jones is not there  another if you can promise it a glass of wine  and so on  for everybody can multiply from his own experience the different terms which his different selves have made with him  and some are too wildly ridiculous to be mentioned in print at all 
2767,so orlando  at the turn by the barn  called  orlando   with a note of interrogation in her voice and waited 
2768,orlando did not come 
2769, right then   orlando said  with the good humour people practise on these occasions  and tried another 
2770,for she had a great variety of selves to call upon  far more than we have been able to find room for  since a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves  whereas a person may well have as many thousand 
2771,choosing then  only those selves we have found room for  orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the nigger own head down  the boy who strung it up again  the boy who sat on the hill  the boy who saw the poet  the boy who handed the queen the bowl of rose water  or she may have called upon the young man who fell in love with sasha  or upon the courtier  or upon the ambassador  or upon the soldier  or upon the traveller  or she may have wanted the woman to come to her  the gipsy  the fine lady  the hermit  the girl in love with life  the patroness of letters  the woman who called mar  meaning hot baths and evening fires  or shelmerdine  meaning crocuses in autumn woods  or bonthrop  meaning the death we die daily  or all three together  which meant more things than we have space to write out  all were different and she may have called upon any one of them 
2772,perhaps  but what appeared certain  for we are now in the region of  perhaps  and  appears   was that the one she needed most kept aloof  for she was  to hear her talk  changing her selves as quickly as she drove  there was a new one at every corner  as happens when  for some unaccountable reason  the conscious self  which is the uppermost  and has the power to desire  wishes to be nothing but one self 
2773,this is what some people call the true self  and it is  they say  compact of all the selves we have it in us to be  commanded and locked up by the captain self  the key self  which amalgamates and controls them all 
2774,orlando was certainly seeking this self as the reader can judge from overhearing her talk as she drove  and if it is rambling talk  disconnected  trivial  dull  and sometimes unintelligible  it is the reader own fault for listening to a lady talking to herself  we only copy her words as she spoke them  adding in brackets which self in our opinion is speaking  but in this we may well be wrong  
2775, what then 
2776,who then   she said 
2777, thirty six  in a motor car  a woman  yes  but a million other things as well  a snob am i  the garter in the hall  the leopards  my ancestors  proud of them  yes  greedy  luxurious  vicious  am i   here a new self came in   do not care a damn if i am  truthful  i think so  generous  oh  but that do not count  here a new self came in   lying in bed of a morning listening to the pigeons on fine linen  silver dishes  wine  maids  footmen  spoilt  perhaps  too many things for nothing  hence my books  here she mentioned fifty classical titles  which represented  so we think  the early romantic works that she tore up   facile  glib  romantic  but  here another self came in  a duffer  a fumbler  more clumsy i could not be  and  and   here she hesitated for a word and if we suggest  love  we may be wrong  but certainly she laughed and blushed and then cried out    a toad set in emeralds 
2778,harry the archduke 
2779,blue bottles on the ceiling 
2780, here another self came in  
2781,but nell  kit  sasha 
2782, she was sunk in gloom  tears actually shaped themselves and she had long given over crying  
2783,trees  she said 
2784, here another self came in  
2785,i love trees  she was passing a clump  growing there a thousand years 
2786,and barns  she passed a tumbledown barn at the edge of the road  
2787,and sheep dogs  here one came trotting across the road  she carefully avoided it  
2788,and the night 
2789,but people  here another self came in  
2790,people 
2791, she repeated it as a question  
2792,i do not know 
2793,chattering  spiteful  always telling lies 
2794, here she turned into the high street of her native town  which was crowded  for it was market day  with farmers  and shepherds  and old women with hens in baskets  
2795,i like peasants 
2796,i understand crops 
2797,but  here another self came skipping over the top of her mind like the beam from a lighthouse  
2798,fame 
2799, she laughed  
2800,fame 
2801,seven editions 
2802,a prize 
2803,photographs in the evening papers  here she alluded to the  oak tree  and  the burdett coutts  memorial prize which she had won  and we must snatch space to remark how discomposing it is for her biographer that this culmination to which the whole book moved  this peroration with which the book was to end  should be dashed from us on a laugh casually like this  but the truth is that when we write of a woman  everything is out of place  culminations and perorations  the accent never falls where it does with a man   fame  she repeated  a poet  a charlatan  both every morning as regularly as the post comes in 
2804,to dine  to meet  to meet  to dine  fame  fame 
2805, she had here to slow down to pass through the crowd of market people  but no one noticed her  a porpoise in a fishmonger own shop attracted far more attention than a lady who had won a prize and might  had she chosen  have worn three coronets one on top of another on her brow  
2806,driving very slowly she now hummed as if it were part of an old song   with my guineas I will buy flowering trees  flowering trees  flowering trees and walk among my flowering trees and tell my sons what fame is  
2807,so she hummed  and now all her words began to sag here and there like a barbaric necklace of heavy beads 
2808, and walk among my flowering trees   she sang  accenting the words strongly   and see the moon rise slow  the waggons go    
2809,here she stopped short and looked ahead of her intently at the bonnet of the car in profound meditation 
2810, he sat at twitchett own table   she mused   with a dirty ruff on   was it old mr baker come to measure the timber 
2811,or was it sh p  re 
2812, for when we speak names we deeply reverence to ourselves we never speak them whole  
2813,she gazed for ten minutes ahead of her  letting the car come almost to a standstill 
2814, haunted   she cried  suddenly pressing the accelerator 
2815, haunted  ever since i was a child  there flies the wild goose  it flies past the window out to sea  up i jumped  she gripped the steering wheel tighter  and stretched after it  but the goose flies too fast  I have seen it  here  there  there  england  persia  italy  always it flies fast out to sea and always i fling after it words like nets  here she flung her hand out  which shrivel as I have seen nets shrivel drawn on deck with only sea weed in them  and sometimes there is an inch of silver  six words  in the bottom of the net  but never the great fish who lives in the coral groves  
2816,here she bent her head  pondering deeply 
2817,and it was at this moment  when she had ceased to call  orlando  and was deep in thoughts of something else  that the orlando whom she had called came of its own accord  as was proved by the change that now came over her  she had passed through the lodge gates and was entering the park  
2818,the whole of her darkened and settled  as when some foil whose addition makes the round and solidity of a surface is added to it  and the shallow becomes deep and the near distant  and all is contained as water is contained by the sides of a well 
2819,so she was now darkened  stilled  and become  with the addition of this orlando  what is called  rightly or wrongly  a single self  a real self 
2820,and she fell silent 
2821,for it is probable that when people talk aloud  the selves  of which there may be more than two thousand  are conscious of disseverment  and are trying to communicate  but when communication is established they fall silent 
2822,masterfully  swiftly  she drove up the curving drive between the elms and oaks through the falling turf of the park whose fall was so gentle that had it been water it would have spread the beach with a smooth green tide 
2823,planted here and in solemn groups were beech trees and oak trees 
2824,the deer stepped among them  one white as snow  another with its head on one side  for some wire netting had caught in its horns 
2825,all this  the trees  deer  and turf  she observed with the greatest satisfaction as if her mind had become a fluid that flowed round things and enclosed them completely 
2826,next minute she drew up in the courtyard where  for so many hundred years she had come  on horseback or in coach and six  with men riding before or coming after  where plumes had tossed  torches flashed  and the same flowering trees that let their leaves drop now had shaken their blossoms 
2827,now she was alone 
2828,the autumn leaves were falling 
2829,the porter opened the great gates 
2830, morning  james   she said   there are some things in the car  will you bring  them in   words of no beauty  interest  or significance themselves  it will be conceded  but now so plumped out with meaning that they fell like ripe nuts from a tree  and proved that when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly 
2831,this was true indeed of every movement and action now  usual though they were  so that to see orlando change her skirt for a pair of whipcord breeches and leather jacket  which she did in less than three minutes  was to be ravished with the beauty of movement as if madame lopokova were using her highest art 
2832,then she strode into the dining room where her old friends dryden  pope  swift  addison regarded her demurely at first as who should say here is the prize winner  but when they reflected that two hundred guineas was in question  they nodded their heads approvingly 
2833,two hundred guineas  they seemed to say  two hundred guineas are not to be sniffed at 
2834,she cut herself a slice of bread and ham  clapped the two together and began to eat  striding up and down the room  thus shedding her company habits in a second  without thinking 
2835,after five or six such turns  she tossed off a glass of red spanish wine  and  filling another which she carried in her hand  strode down the long corridor and through a dozen drawing rooms and so began a perambulation of the house  attended by such elk hounds and spaniels as chose to follow her 
2836,this  too  was all in the day own routine 
2837,as soon would she come home and leave her own grandmother without a kiss as come back and leave the house unvisited 
2838,she fancied that the rooms brightened as she came in  stirred  opened their eyes as if they had been dozing in her absence 
2839,she fancied  too  that  hundreds and thousands of times as she had seen them  they never looked the same twice  as if so long a life as theirs had stored in them a myriad moods which changed with winter and summer  bright weather and dark  and her own fortunes and the people own characters who visited them 
2840,polite  they always were to strangers  but a little weary  with her  they were entirely open and at their ease 
2841,why not indeed 
2842,they had known each other for close on four centuries now 
2843,they had nothing to conceal 
2844,she knew their sorrows and joys 
2845,she knew what age each part of them was and its little secrets  a hidden drawer  a concealed cupboard  or some deficiency perhaps  such as a part made up  or added later 
2846,they  too  knew her in all her moods and changes 
2847,she had hidden nothing from them  had come to them as boy and woman  crying and dancing  brooding and gay 
2848,in this window seat  she had written her first verses  in that chapel  she had been married 
2849,and she would be buried here  she reflected  kneeling on the window sill in the long gallery and sipping her spanish wine 
2850,though she could hardly fancy it  the body of the heraldic leopard would be making yellow pools on the floor the day they lowered her to lie among her ancestors 
2851,she  who believed in no immortality  could not help feeling that her soul would come and go forever with the reds on the panels and the greens on the sofa 
2852,for the room  she had strolled into the ambassador own bedroom  shone like a she will that has lain at the bottom of the sea for centuries and has been crusted over and painted a million tints by the water  it was rose and yellow  green and sand coloured 
2853,it was frail as a she will  as iridescent and as empty 
2854,no ambassador would ever sleep there again 
2855,ah  but she knew where the heart of the house still beat 
2856,gently opening a door  she stood on the threshold so that  as she fancied  the room could not see her and watched the tapestry rising and falling on the eternal faint breeze which never failed to move it 
2857,still the hunter rode  still daphne flew 
2858,the heart still beat  she thought  however faintly  however far withdrawn  the frail indomitable heart of the immense building 
2859,now  calling her troop of dogs to her she passed down the gallery whose floor was laid with whole oak trees sawn across 
2860,rows of chairs with all their velvets faded stood ranged against the wall holding their arms out for elizabeth  for james  for shakespeare it might be  for cecil  who never came 
2861,the sight made her gloomy 
2862,she unhooked the rope that fenced them off 
2863,she sat on the queen own chair  she opened a manuscript book lying on lady betty own table  she stirred her fingers in the aged rose leaves  she brushed her short hair with king james  silver brushes  she bounced up and down upon his bed  but no king would ever sleep there again  for all louise own new sheets  and pressed her cheek against the worn silver counterpane that lay upon it 
2864,but everywhere were little lavender bags to keep the moth out and printed notices   please do not touch   which  though she had put them there herself  seemed to rebuke her 
2865,the house was no longer hers entirely  she sighed 
2866,it belonged to time now  to history  was past the touch and control of the living 
2867,never would beer be spilt here any more  she thought  she was in the bedroom that had been old nick greene own   or holes burnt in the carpet 
2868,never two hundred servants come running and brawling down the corridors with warming pans and great branches for the great fireplaces 
2869,never would ale be brewed and candles made and saddles fashioned and stone shaped in the workshops outside the house 
2870,hammers and mallets were silent now 
2871,chairs and beds were empty  tankards of silver and gold were locked in glass cases 
2872,the great wings of silence beat up and down the empty house 
2873,so she sat at the end of the gallery with her dogs couched round her  in queen elizabeth own hard armchair 
2874,the gallery stretched far away to a point where the light almost failed 
2875,it was as a tunnel bored deep into the past 
2876,as her eyes peered down it  she could see people laughing and talking  the great men she had known  dryden  swift  and pope  and statesmen in colloquy  and lovers dallying in the window seats  and people eating and drinking at the long tables  and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making them sneeze and cough 
2877,still further down  she saw sets of splendid dancers formed for the quadrille 
2878,a fluty  frail  but nevertheless stately music began to play 
2879,an organ boomed 
2880,a coffin was borne into the chapel 
2881,a marriage procession came out of it 
2882,armed men with helmets left for the wars 
2883,they brought banners back from flodden and poitiers and stuck them on the wall 
2884,the long gallery filled itself thus  and still peering further  she thought she could make out at the very end  beyond the elizabethans and the tudors  some one older  further  darker  a cowled figure  monastic  severe  a monk  who went with his hands clasped  and a book in them  murmuring  
2885,like thunder  the stable clock struck four 
2886,never did any earthquake so demolish a whole town 
2887,the gallery and all its occupants fell to powder 
2888,her own face  that had been dark and sombre as she gazed  was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder 
2889,in this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness 
2890,she saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue sheen on their bodies  she saw a knot in the wood where her foot was  and her dog own ear twitching 
2891,at the same time  she heard a bough creaking in the garden  a sheep coughing in the park  a swift screaming past the window 
2892,her own body quivered and tingled as if suddenly stood naked in a hard frost 
2893,yet  she kept  as she had not done when the clock struck ten in london  complete composure  for she was now one and entire  and presented  it may be  a larger surface to the shock of time  
2894,she rose  but without precipitation  called her dogs  and went firmly but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden 
2895,here the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct 
2896,she noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye 
2897,she saw the intricacy of the twigs of every tree 
2898,each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of veins and petals 
2899,she saw stubbs  the gardener  coming along the path  and every button on his gaiters was visible  she saw betty and prince  the cart horses  and never had she marked so clearly the white star on betty own forehead  and the three long hairs that fell down below the rest on prince own tail 
2900,out in the quadrangle the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new photograph  she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a dance tune that people were listening to in the red velvet opera house at vienna 
2901,braced and strung up by the present moment she was also strangely afraid  as if whenever the gulf of time gaped and let a second through some unknown danger might come with it 
2902,the tension was too relentless and too rigorous to be endured long without discomfort 
2903,she walked more briskly than she liked  as if her legs were moved for her  through the garden and out into the park 
2904,here she forced herself  by a great effort  to stop by the carpenter own shop  and to stand stock still watching joe stubbs fashion a cart wheel 
2905,she was standing with her eye fixed on his hand when the quarter struck 
2906,it hurtled through her like a meteor  so hot that no fingers can hold it 
2907,she saw with disgusting vividness that the thumb on joe own right hand was without a finger nail and there was a raised saucer of pink flesh where the nail should have been 
2908,the sight was so repulsive that she felt faint for a moment  but in that moment own darkness  when her eyelids flickered  she was relieved of the pressure of the present 
2909,there was something strange in the shadow that the flicker of her eyes cast  something which  as anyone can test for himself by looking now at the sky  is always absent from the present  whence its terror  its nondescript character  something one trembles to pin through the body with a name and call beauty  for it has no body  is as a shadow without substance or quality of its own  yet has the power to change whatever it adds itself to 
2910,this shadow now  while she flickered her eye in her faintness in the carpenter own shop  stole out  and attaching itself to the innumerable sights she had been receiving  composed them into something tolerable  comprehensible 
2911,her mind began to toss like the sea 
2912,yes  she thought  heaving a deep sigh of relief  as she turned from the carpenter own shop to climb the hill  i can begin to live again 
2913,i am by the serpentine  she thought  the little boat is climbing through the white arch of a thousand deaths 
2914,i am about to understand   
2915,those were her words  spoken quite distinctly  but we cannot conceal the fact that she was now a very indifferent witness to the truth of what was before her and might easily have mistaken a sheep for a cow  or an old man called smith for one who was called jones and was no relation of his whatever 
2916,for the shadow of faintness which the thumb without a nail had cast had deepened now  at the back of her brain  which is the part furthest from sight   into a pool where things dwell in darkness so deep that what they are we scarcely know 
2917,she now looked down into this pool or sea in which everything is reflected  and  indeed  some say that all our most violent passions  and art and religion  are the reflections which we see in the dark hollow at the back of the head when the visible world is obscured for the time 
2918,she looked there now  long  deeply  profoundly  and immediately the ferny path up the hill along which she was walking became not entirely a path  but partly the serpentine  the hawthorn bushes were partly ladies and gentlemen sitting with card cases and gold mounted canes  the sheep were partly tall mayfair houses  everything was partly something else  as if her mind had become a forest with glades branching here and there  things came nearer  and further  and mingled and separated and made the strangest alliances and combinations in an incessant chequer of light and shade 
2919,except when canute  the elk hound  chased a rabbit and so reminded her that it must be about half past four  it was indeed twenty three minutes to six  she forgot the time 
2920,the ferny path led  with many turns and windings  higher and higher to the oak tree  which stood on the top 
2921,the tree had grown bigger  sturdier  and more knotted since she had known it  somewhere about the year   but it was still in the prime of life 
2922,the little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering thickly on its branches 
2923,flinging herself on the ground  she felt the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way and that beneath her 
2924,she liked to think that she was riding the back of the world 
2925,she liked to attach herself to something hard 
2926,as she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her leather jacket  her poem  the oak tree    i should have brought a trowel   she reflected  the earth was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could do as she meant and bury the book here  besides  the dogs would dig it up  no luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations  she thought  perhaps it would be as well then to do without them  she had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to speak over the book as she buried it   it was a copy of the first edition  signed by author and artist    i bury this as a tribute   she was going to have said   a return to the land of what the land has given me   but lord  once one began mouthing words aloud  how silly they sounded  she was reminded of old greene getting upon a platform the other day comparing her with milton  save for his blindness  and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas  she had thought then  of the oak tree here on its hill  and what has that got to do with this  she had wondered  what has praise and fame to do with poetry  what has seven editions  the book had already gone into no less  got to do with the value of it  was not writing poetry a secret transaction  a voice answering a voice  so that all this chatter and praise and blame and meeting people who admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill suited as could be to the thing itself  a voice answering a voice 
2927,what could have been more secret  she thought  more slow  and like the intercourse of lovers  than the stammering answer she had made all these years to the old crooning song of the woods  and the farms and the brown horses standing at the gate  neck to neck  and the smithy and the kitchen and the fields  so laboriously bearing wheat  turnips  grass  and the garden blowing irises and fritillaries 
2928,so she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground  and watched the vast view  varied like an ocean floor this evening with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it 
2929,there was a village with a church tower among elm trees  a grey domed manor house in a park  a spark of light burning on some glass house  a farmyard with yellow corn stacks 
2930,the fields were marked with black tree clumps  and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands  and there was the gleam of a river  and then hills again 
2931,in the far distance snowdon own crags broke white among the clouds  she saw the far scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the hebrides 
2932,she listened for the sound of gun firing out at sea 
2933,no  only the wind blew 
2934,there was no war to day 
2935,drake had gone  nelson had gone 
2936, and there   she thought  letting her eyes  which had been looking at these far distances  drop once more to the land beneath her   was my land once  that castle between the downs was mine  and all that moor running almost to the sea was mine  
2937,here the landscape  it must have been some trick of the fading light  shook itself  heaped itself  let all this encumbrance of houses  castles  and woods slide off its tent shaped sides 
2938,the bare mountains of turkey were before her 
2939,it was blazing noon 
2940,she looked straight at the baked hill side 
2941,goats cropped the sandy tufts at her feet 
2942,an eagle soared above 
2943,the raucous voice of old rustum  the gipsy  croaked in her ears   what is your antiquity and your race  and your possessions compared with this  what do you need with four hundred bedrooms and silver lids on all your dishes  and housemaids dusting  
2944,at this moment some church clock chimed in the valley 
2945,the tent like landscape collapsed and fell 
2946,the present showered down upon her head once more  but now that the light was fading  gentlier than before  calling into view nothing detailed  nothing small  but only misty fields  cottages with lamps in them  the slumbering bulk of a wood  and a fan shaped light pushing the darkness before it along some lane 
2947,whether it had struck nine  ten  or eleven  she could not say 
2948,night had come  night that she loved of all times  night in which the reflections in the dark pool of the mind shine more clearly than by day 
2949,it was not necessary to faint now in order to look deep into the darkness where things shape themselves and to see in the pool of the mind now shakespeare  now a girl in russian trousers  now a toy boat on the serpentine  and then the atlantic itself  where it storms in great waves past cape horn 
2950,she looked into the darkness 
2951,there was her husband own brig  rising to the top of the wave 
2952,up  it went  and up and up 
2953,the white arch of a thousand deaths rose before it 
2954,oh rash  oh ridiculous man  always sailing  so uselessly  round cape horn in the teeth of a gale 
2955,but the brig was through the arch and out on the other side  it was safe at last 
2956, ecstasy   she cried   ecstasy  
2957,and then the wind sank  the waters grew calm  and she saw the waves rippling peacefully in the moonlight 
2958, marmaduke bonthrop shelmerdine   she cried  standing by the oak tree 
2959,the beautiful  glittering name fell out of the sky like a steel blue feather 
2960,she watched it fall  turning and twisting like a slow falling arrow that cleaves the deep air beautifully 
2961,he was coming  as he always came  in moments of dead calm  when the wave rippled and the spotted leaves fell slowly over her foot in the autumn woods  when the leopard was still  the moon was on the waters  and nothing moved in between sky and sea 
2962,then he came 
2963,all was still now 
2964,it was near midnight 
2965,the moon rose slowly over the weald 
2966,its light raised a phantom castle upon earth 
2967,there stood the great house with all its windows robed in silver 
2968,of wall or substance there was none 
2969,all was phantom 
2970,all was still 
2971,all was lit as for the coming of a dead queen 
2972,gazing below her  orlando saw dark plumes tossing in the courtyard  and torches flickering and shadows kneeling 
2973,a queen once more stepped from her chariot 
2974, the house is at your service  madam   she cried  curtseying deeply 
2975, nothing has been changed  the dead lord  my father  shall lead you in  
2976,as she spoke  the first stroke of midnight sounded 
2977,the cold breeze of the present brushed her face with its little breath of fear 
2978,she looked anxiously into the sky 
2979,it was dark with clouds now 
2980,the wind roared in her ears 
2981,but in the roar of the wind she heard the roar of an aeroplane coming nearer and nearer 
2982, here 
2983,shel  here   she cried  baring her breast to the moon  which now showed bright  so that her pearls glowed  like the eggs of some vast moon spider 
2984,the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds and stood over her head 
2985,it hovered above her 
2986,her pearls burnt like a phosphorescent flare in the darkness 
2987,and as shelmerdine  now grown a fine sea captain  hale  fresh coloured  and alert  leapt to the ground  there sprang up over his head a single wild bird 
2988, it is the goose  
2989,orlando cried 
2990, the wild goose    
2991,and the twelfth stroke of midnight sounded  the twelfth stroke of midnight  thursday  the eleventh of october  nineteen hundred and twenty eight
