1,1,0,"Orlando's fathers had ridden in fields of asphodel, and stony fields, and fields watered by strange rivers, and they had struck many heads of many colours off many shoulders, and brought them back to hang from the rafters. So too would Orlando, he vowed. But since he was sixteen only, and too young to ride with them in Africa or France, he would steal away from his mother and the peacocks in the garden and go to his attic room and there lunge and plunge and slice the air with his blade. Sometimes he cut the cord so that the skull bumped on the floor and he had to string it up again, fastening it with some chivalry almost out of reach so that his enemy grinned at him through shrunk, black lips triumphantly. The skull swung to and fro, for the house, at the top of which he lived, was so vast that there seemed trapped in it the wind itself, blowing this way, blowing that way, winter and summer. The green arras with the hunters on it moved perpetually. His fathers had been noble since they had been at all. They came out of the northern mists wearing coronets on their heads. Were not the bars of darkness in the room, and the yellow pools which chequered the floor, made by the sun falling through the stained glass of a vast coat of arms in the window? Orlando stood now in the midst of the yellow body of an heraldic leopard. When he put his hand on the window-sill to push the window open, it was instantly coloured red, blue, and yellow like a butterfly's wing. Thus, those who like symbols, and have a turn for the deciphering of them, might observe that though the shapely legs, the handsome body, and the well-set shoulders were all of them decorated with various tints of heraldic light, Orlando's face, as he threw the window open, was lit solely by the sun itself. A more candid, sullen face it would be impossible to find. Happy the mother who bears, happier still the biographer who records the life of such a one! Never need she vex herself, nor he invoke the help of novelist or poet. From deed to deed, from glory to glory, from office to office he must go, his scribe following after, till they reach whatever seat it may be that is the height of their desire. Orlando, to look at, was cut out precisely for some such career. The red of the cheeks was covered with peach down; the down on the lips was only a little thicker than the down on the cheeks. The lips themselves were short and slightly drawn back over teeth of an exquisite and almond whiteness. Nothing disturbed the arrowy nose in its short, tense flight; the hair was dark, the ears small, and fitted closely to the head. But, alas, that these catalogues of youthful beauty cannot end without mentioning forehead and eyes. Alas, that people are seldom born devoid of all three; for directly we glance at Orlando standing by the window, we must admit that he had eyes like drenched violets, so large that the water seemed to have brimmed in them and widened them; and a brow like the swelling of a marble dome pressed between the two blank medallions which were his temples. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, thus do we rhapsodize. Directly we glance at eyes and forehead, we have to admit a thousand disagreeables which it is the aim of every good biographer to ignore. Sights disturbed him, like that of his mother, a very beautiful lady in green walking out to feed the peacocks with Twitchett, her maid, behind her; sights exalted him--the birds and the trees; and made him in love with death--the evening sky, the homing rooks; and so, mounting up the spiral stairway into his brain--which was a roomy one--all these sights, and the garden sounds too, the hammer beating, the wood chopping, began that riot and confusion of the passions and emotions which every good biographer detests, But to continue--Orlando slowly drew in his head, sat down at the table, and, with the half-conscious air of one doing what they do every day of their lives at this hour, took out a writing book labelled 'Aethelbert: A Tragedy in Five Acts,' and dipped an old stained goose

2,2,0,"Soon he had covered ten pages and more with poetry. He was fluent, evidently, but he was abstract. Vice, Crime, Misery were the personages of his drama; there were Kings and Queens of impossible territories; horrid plots confounded them; noble sentiments suffused them; there was never a word said as he himself would have said it, but all was turned with a fluency and sweetness which, considering his age--he was not yet seventeen--and that the sixteenth century had still some years of its course to run, were remarkable enough. At last, however, he came to a halt. He was describing, as all young poets are for ever describing, nature, and in order to match the shade of green precisely he looked (and here he showed more audacity than most) at the thing itself, which happened to be a laurel bush growing beneath the window. After that, of course, he could write no more. Green in nature is one thing, green in literature another. Nature and letters seem to have a natural antipathy; bring them together and they tear each other to pieces. The shade of green Orlando now saw spoilt his rhyme and split his metre. Moreover, nature has tricks of her own. Once look out of a window at bees among flowers, at a yawning dog, at the sun setting, once think 'how many more suns shall I see set', etc. etc. (the thought is too well known to be worth writing out) and one drops the pen, takes one's cloak, strides out of the room, and catches one's foot on a painted chest as one does so.

3,3,0,"He was careful to avoid meeting anyone. There was Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the path. He hid behind a tree till he had passed. He let himself out at a little gate in the garden wall. He skirted all stables, kennels, breweries, carpenters' shops, washhouses, places where they make tallow candles, kill oxen, forge horse-shoes, stitch jerkins--for the house was a town ringing with men at work at their various crafts--and gained the ferny path leading uphill through the park unseen. There is perhaps a kinship among qualities; one draws another along with it; and the biographer should here call attention to the fact that this clumsiness is often mated with a love of solitude.

4,4,0,"So, after a long silence, 'I am alone', he breathed at last, opening his lips for the first time in this record. He had walked very quickly uphill through ferns and hawthorn bushes, startling deer and wild birds, to a place crowned by a single oak tree. It was very high, so high indeed that nineteen English counties could be seen beneath; and on clear days thirty or perhaps forty, if the weather was very fine. Sometimes one could see the English Channel, wave reiterating upon wave. Rivers could be seen and pleasure boats gliding on them; and galleons setting out to sea; and armadas with puffs of smoke from which came the dull thud of cannon firing; and forts on the coast; and castles among the meadows; and here a watch tower; and there a fortress; and again some vast mansion like that of Orlando's father, massed like a town in the valley circled by walls. To the east there were the spires of London and the smoke of the city; and perhaps on the very sky line, when the wind was in the right quarter, the craggy top and serrated edges of Snowdon herself showed mountainous among the clouds. For a moment Orlando stood counting, gazing, recognizing. That was his father's house; that his uncle's. His aunt owned those three great turrets among the trees there.

To the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there, gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself; the little leaves hung, the deer stopped; the pale summer clouds stayed; his limbs grew heavy on the ground; and he lay so still that by degrees the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past, as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer's evening were woven web-like about his body.",he sighed profoundly  and flung himself  there was a passion in his movements which deserves the word  on the earth at the foot of the oak tree  he loved  beneath all this summer transiency  to feel the earth own spine beneath him  for such he took the hard root of the oak tree to be  or  for image followed image  it was the back of a great horse that he was riding  or the deck of a tumbling ship  it was anything indeed  so long as it was hard  for he felt the need of something which he could attach his floating heart to  the heart that tugged at his side  the heart that seemed filled with spiced and amorous gales every evening about this time when he walked out  to the oak tree he tied it and as he lay there  gradually the flutter in and about him stilled itself  the little leaves hung  the deer stopped  the pale summer clouds stayed  his limbs grew heavy on the ground  and he lay so still that by degrees the deer stepped nearer and the rooks wheeled round him and the swallows dipped and circled and the dragonflies shot past  as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer own evening were woven web like about his body ,1143,213,0.09999999999999998,-0.19433603186373027,-0.12631578947368424,-0.19433603186373027,-0.16375029480425324,1.1,0.05897580604788959,0.16551724137931037,0.05897580604788959,0.022521685741882933,31.30345196574341,0.4795278657979152,0.4517803990187966,0.4795278657979152,0.30584730730368187,3.451190476190476,1.3309979575065165,1.549206758896992,1.3309979575065165,0.8167924746536909,9.134999999999998,0.6978744858318775,0.8123854145447137,0.6978744858318775,0.39188596652779123,45.486824175609115,0.9455229516418643,1.3563806621450583,0.9455229516418643,0.5775931884216491,1.0930809971762894,0.4634217100252423,0.609855977239384,0.4634217100252423,0.4502414175566808,"{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9468}",0.9468,1.0977685259189887,0.4951750758202372,1.0977685259189887,0.3629818291771006,0.09390625,-0.1348355907863752,-0.08553657761400033,-0.1348355907863752,-0.0036490284302389225,0.2782885790722891,-0.19613458727252475,-0.0023657464614592074,-0.19613458727252475,-0.12521984295240504,40.26181672932666,0.31159182183508427,0.3802971218308086,0.31159182183508427,-0.17507753349676328,-0.5096,-0.24182740184371623,0.2114321346913323,-0.24182740184371623,0.07226904620480276

Some were small hurrying lights, as if servants dashed along corridors to answer summonses; others were high and lustrous lights, as if they burnt in empty banqueting-halls made ready to receive guests who had not come; and others dipped and waved and sank and rose, as if held in the hands of troops of serving men, bending, kneeling, rising, receiving, guarding, and escorting with all dignity indoors a great Princess alighting from her chariot.

8,8,0,"By short cuts known to him, he made his way now through the vast congeries of rooms and staircases to the banqueting-hall, five acres distant on the other side of the house. But half-way there, in the back quarters where the servants lived, he stopped. The door of Mrs Stewkley's sitting-room stood open--she was gone, doubtless, with all her keys to wait upon her mistress. But there, sitting at the servant's dinner table with a tankard beside him and paper in front of him, sat a rather fat, shabby man, whose ruff was a thought dirty, and whose clothes were of hodden brown. He held a pen in his hand, but he was not writing. He seemed in the act of rolling some thought up and down, to and fro in his mind till it gathered shape or momentum to his liking. His eyes, globed and clouded like some green stone of curious texture, were fixed. He did not see Orlando. For all his hurry, Orlando stopped dead. Was this a poet? Was he writing poetry? 'Tell me', he wanted to say, 'everything in the whole world'--for he had the wildest, most absurd, extravagant ideas about poets and poetry--but how speak to a man who does not see you? who sees ogres, satyrs, perhaps the depths of the sea instead? So Orlando stood gazing while the man turned his pen in his fingers, this way and that way; and gazed and mused; and then, very quickly, wrote half-a-dozen lines and looked up. Whereupon Orlando, overcome with shyness, darted off and reached the banqueting-hall only just in time to sink upon his knees and, hanging his head in confusion, to offer a bowl of rose water to the great Queen herself.",by short cuts known to him  he made his way now through the vast congeries of rooms and staircases to the banqueting hall  five acres distant on the other side of the house  but half way there  in the back quarters where the servants lived  he stopped  the door of mrs stewkley own sitting room stood open  she was gone  doubtless  with all her keys to wait upon her mistress  but there  sitting at the servant own dinner table with a tankard beside him and paper in front of him  sat a rather fat  shabby man  whose ruff was a thought dirty  and whose clothes were of hodden brown  he held a pen in his hand  but he was not writing  he seemed in the act of rolling some thought up and down  to and fro in his mind till it gathered shape or momentum to his liking  his eyes  globed and clouded like some green stone of curious texture  were fixed  he did not see orlando  for all his hurry  orlando stopped dead  was this a poet  was he writing poetry   tell me   he wanted to say   everything in the whole world   for he had the wildest  most absurd  extravagant ideas about poets and poetry  but how speak to a man who does not see you  who sees ogres  satyrs  perhaps the depths of the sea instead  so orlando stood gazing while the man turned his pen in his fingers  this way and that way  and gazed and mused  and then  very quickly  wrote half a dozen lines and looked up  whereupon orlando  overcome with shyness  darted off and reached the banqueting hall only just in time to sink upon his knees and  hanging his head in confusion  to offer a bowl of rose water to the great queen herself ,1594,290,-2.0999999999999996,-0.7592986387818604,-0.7438596491228069,-0.7592986387818604,-0.420006956858796,-3.0999999999999996,-1.038609853813432,-0.9931034482758619,-1.038609853813432,-0.47347876808928446,-59.63820247630544,-0.8302519942678431,-0.8607156469834137,-0.8302519942678431,-0.4279751770563974,1.9124999999999996,0.6597882642565822,0.804562007735087,0.6597882642565822,0.23132099268420594,5.333000000000002,0.07788015645810543,0.2960548652135537,0.07788015645810543,-0.20716816628094198,-19.099630354877146,-1.0051461479499202,-1.0108853840031855,-1.0051461479499202,-0.6085987478862286,0.17220268849901793,-0.1409340238089824,0.0960759899303973,-0.1409340238089824,0.052097229919561915,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.3612}",0.3612,0.2084794557695812,0.03387293709874358,0.2084794557695812,-0.087395193162595,0.06606280193236715,-0.32109106622086736,-0.2365483733403931,-0.32109106622086736,-0.1653922210614334,0.2832627620337805,-0.18371020443111188,0.006312359652059273,-0.18371020443111188,-0.22987459069497307,51.83300923820439,0.7687573693096281,0.7145612819187644,0.7687573693096281,-0.29542116098276205,-0.9989,-0.8054926024551149,-0.05977967158594893,-0.8054926024551149,-0.013521166374452557

It was a memorable hand; a thin hand with long fingers always curling as if round orb or sceptre; a nervous, crabbed, sickly hand; a commanding hand too; a hand that had only to raise itself for a head to fall; a hand, he guessed, attached to an old body that smelt like a cupboard in which furs are kept in camphor; which body was yet caparisoned in all sorts of brocades and gems; and held itself very upright though perhaps in pain from sciatica; and never flinched though strung together by a thousand fears; and the Queen's eyes were light yellow. All this he felt as the great rings flashed in the water and then something pressed his hair--which, perhaps, accounts for his seeing nothing more likely to be of use to a historian.

But if it is possible from a hand to deduce a body, informed with all the attributes of a great Queen, her crabbedness, courage, frailty, and terror, surely a head can be as fertile, looked down upon from a chair of state by a lady whose eyes were always, if the waxworks at the Abbey are to be trusted, wide open. The long, curled hair, the dark head bent so reverently, so innocently before her, implied a pair of the finest legs that a young nobleman has ever stood upright upon; and violet eyes; and a heart of gold; and loyalty and manly charm--all qualities which the old woman loved the more the more they failed her. For she was growing old and worn and bent before her time. The sound of cannon was always in her ears. She saw always the glistening poison drop and the long stiletto. As she sat at table she listened; she heard the guns in the Channel; she dreaded--was that a curse, was that a whisper? Innocence, simplicity, were all the more dear to her for the dark background she set them against.

But inwardly? She flashed her yellow hawk's eyes upon him as if she would pierce his soul. The young man withstood her gaze blushing only a damask rose as became him. Strength, grace, romance, folly, poetry, youth--she read him like a page. Instantly she plucked a ring from her finger (the joint was swollen rather) and as she fitted it to his, named him her Treasurer and Steward; next hung about him chains of office; and bidding him bend his knee, tied round it at the slenderest part the jewelled order of the Garter. Nothing after that was denied him. When she drove in state he rode at her carriage door. She sent him to Scotland on a sad embassy to the unhappy Queen. He was about to sail for the Polish wars when she recalled him. For how could she bear to think of that tender flesh torn and that curly head rolled in the dust? She kept him with her. At the height of her triumph when the guns were booming at the Tower and the air was thick enough with gunpowder to make one sneeze and the huzzas of the people rang beneath the windows, she pulled him down among the cushions where her women had laid her (she was so worn and old) and made him bury his face in that astonishing composition--she had not changed her dress for a month--which smelt for all the world, he thought, recalling his boyish memory, like some old cabinet at home where his mother's furs were stored. He rose, half suffocated from the embrace.

16,16,0,"It was Orlando's fault perhaps; yet, after all, are we to blame Orlando? The age was the Elizabethan; their morals were not ours; nor their poets; nor their climate; nor their vegetables even. Everything was different. The weather itself, the heat and cold of summer and winter, was, we may believe, of another temper altogether. The brilliant amorous day was divided as sheerly from the night as land from water. Sunsets were redder and more intense; dawns were whiter and more auroral. Of our crepuscular half-lights and lingering twilights they knew nothing. The rain fell vehemently, or not at all. The sun blazed or there was darkness. Translating this to the spiritual regions as their wont is, the poets sang beautifully how roses fade and petals fall. The moment is brief they sang; the moment is over; one long night is then to be slept by all. As for using the artifices of the greenhouse or conservatory to prolong or preserve these fresh pinks and roses, that was not their way. The withered intricacies and ambiguities of our more gradual and doubtful age were unknown to them. Violence was all. The flower bloomed and faded. The sun rose and sank. The lover loved and went. And what the poets said in rhyme, the young translated into practice. Girls were roses, and their seasons were short as the flowers'. Plucked they must be before nightfall; for the day was brief and the day was all. Thus, if Orlando followed the leading of the climate, of the poets, of the age itself, and plucked his flower in the window-seat even with the snow on the ground and the Queen vigilant in the corridor we can scarcely bring ourselves to blame him. He was young; he was boyish; he did but as nature bade him do. As for the girl, we know no more than Queen Elizabeth herself did what her name was. It may have been Doris, Chloris, Delia, or Diana, for he made rhymes to them all in turn; equally, she may have been a court lady, or some serving maid. For Orlando's taste was broad; he was no lover of garden flowers only; the wild and the weeds even had always a fascination for him.",it was orlando own fault perhaps  yet  after all  are we to blame orlando  the age was the elizabethan  their morals were not ours  nor their poets  nor their climate  nor their vegetables even  everything was different  the weather itself  the heat and cold of summer and winter  was  we may believe  of another temper altogether  the brilliant amorous day was divided as sheerly from the night as land from water  sunsets were redder and more intense  dawns were whiter and more auroral  of our crepuscular half lights and lingering twilights they knew nothing  the rain fell vehemently  or not at all  the sun blazed or there was darkness  translating this to the spiritual regions as their will not is  the poets sang beautifully how roses fade and petals fall  the moment is brief they sang  the moment is over  one long night is then to be slept by all  as for using the artifices of the greenhouse or conservatory to prolong or preserve these fresh pinks and roses  that was not their way  the withered intricacies and ambiguities of our more gradual and doubtful age were unknown to them  violence was all  the flower bloomed and faded  the sun rose and sank  the lover loved and went  and what the poets said in rhyme  the young translated into practice  girls were roses  and their seasons were short as the flowers   plucked they must be before nightfall  for the day was brief and the day was all  thus  if orlando followed the leading of the climate  of the poets  of the age itself  and plucked his flower in the window seat even with the snow on the ground and the queen vigilant in the corridor we can scarcely bring ourselves to blame him  he was young  he was boyish  he did but as nature bade him do  as for the girl  we know no more than queen elizabeth herself did what her name was  it may have been doris  chloris  delia  or diana  for he made rhymes to them all in turn  equally  she may have been a court lady  or some serving maid  for orlando own taste was broad  he was no lover of garden flowers only  the wild and the weeds even had always a fascination for him ,2084,375,2.6,0.4476669305432359,0.575438596491228,0.4476669305432359,0.051064128819180404,2.6,0.45097068456979017,0.5793103448275863,0.45097068456979017,0.07786628044324034,-57.63546538469158,-0.8014077344652676,-0.831811570737471,-0.8014077344652676,-0.3198531039400795,2.8340277777777807,1.061778389375774,1.250532677853911,1.061778389375774,0.28997693396499535,5.122999999999998,0.043635335530042715,0.2675358185645412,0.043635335530042715,-0.32279225955284346,-6.2734583220323605,-0.6177643411546758,-0.5407719248245639,-0.6177643411546758,-0.4000212136960203,1.6555821981862024,0.8325810472749994,0.9236888226793842,0.8325810472749994,0.3873398521647872,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': 0.8255}",0.8255,0.9135629859443931,0.3996218834928513,0.9135629859443931,0.04714784488845532,0.1602011494252873,0.3086363521046582,0.2740206074514183,0.3086363521046582,-0.014026981091400534,0.9068366445531033,1.3738361717889132,1.0942177230082375,1.3738361717889132,0.22760979709267315,63.077681750894314,1.2130224579331021,1.0393930579033617,1.2130224579331021,-0.41856354791078576,-0.9256,-0.7210522607326226,-0.019150557749601654,-0.7210522607326226,0.06608931295178262
17,17,0,"Here, indeed, we lay bare rudely, as a biographer may, a curious trait in him, to be accounted for, perhaps, by the fact that a certain grandmother of his had worn a smock and carried milkpails. Some grains of the Kentish or Sussex earth were mixed with the thin, fine fluid which came to him from Normandy. He held that the mixture of brown earth and blue blood was a good one. Certain it is that he had always a liking for low company, especially for that of lettered people whose wits so often keep them under, as if there were the sympathy of blood between them. At this season of his life, when his head brimmed with rhymes and he never went to bed without striking off some conceit, the cheek of an innkeeper's daughter seemed fresher and the wit of a gamekeeper's niece seemed quicker than those of the ladies at Court. Hence, he began going frequently to Wapping Old Stairs and the beer gardens at night, wrapped in a grey cloak to hide the star at his neck and the garter at his knee. There, with a mug before him, among the sanded alleys and bowling greens and all the simple architecture of such places, he listened to sailors' stories of hardship and horror and cruelty on the Spanish main; how some had lost their toes, others their noses--for the spoken story was never so rounded or so finely coloured as the written.

Every day sailed to sea some fine ship bound for the Indies; now and again another blackened and ragged with hairy men on board crept painfully to anchor. No one missed a boy or girl if they dallied a little on the water after sunset; or raised an eyebrow if gossip had seen them sleeping soundly among the treasure sacks safe in each other's arms. Such indeed was the adventure that befel Orlando, Sukey, and the Earl of Cumberland. The day was hot; their loves had been active; they had fallen asleep among the rubies. Late that night the Earl, whose fortunes were much bound up in the Spanish ventures, came to check the booty alone with a lantern. He flashed the light on a barrel. He started back with an oath. Twined about the cask two spirits lay sleeping. Superstitious by nature, and his conscience laden with many a crime, the Earl took the couple--they were wrapped in a red cloak, and Sukey's bosom was almost as white as the eternal snows of Orlando's poetry--for a phantom sprung from the graves of drowned sailors to upbraid him. He crossed himself. He vowed repentance. The row of alms houses still standing in the Sheen Road is the visible fruit of that moment's panic.

19,19,0,"Soon, however, Orlando grew tired, not only of the discomfort of this way of life, and of the crabbed streets of the neighbourhood, but of the primitive manner of the people. For it has to be remembered that crime and poverty had none of the attraction for the Elizabethans that they have for us. They had none of our modern shame of book learning; none of our belief that to be born the son of a butcher is a blessing and to be unable to read a virtue; no fancy that what we call 'life' and 'reality' are somehow connected with ignorance and brutality; nor, indeed, any equivalent for these two words at all. It was not to seek 'life' that Orlando went among them; not in quest of 'reality' that he left them. But when he had heard a score of times how Jakes had lost his nose and Sukey her honour--and they told the stories admirably, it must be admitted--he began to be a little weary of the repetition, for a nose can only be cut off in one way and maidenhood lost in another--or so it seemed to him--whereas the arts and the sciences had a diversity about them which stirred his curiosity profoundly. So, always keeping them in happy memory, he left off frequenting the beer gardens and the skittle alleys, hung his grey cloak in his wardrobe, let his star shine at his neck and his garter twinkle at his knee, and appeared once more at the Court of King James. He was young, he was rich, he was handsome.

She spoke Italian well, had a perfect set of teeth in the upper jaw, though those on the lower were slightly discoloured. She was never without a whippet or spaniel at her knee; fed them with white bread from her own plate; sang sweetly to the virginals; and was never dressed before mid-day owing to the extreme care she took of her person.

24,24,0,"The Great Frost was, historians tell us, the most severe that has ever visited these islands. Birds froze in mid-air and fell like stones to the ground. At Norwich a young countrywoman started to cross the road in her usual robust health and was seen by the onlookers to turn visibly to powder and be blown in a puff of dust over the roofs as the icy blast struck her at the street corner. The mortality among sheep and cattle was enormous. Corpses froze and could not be drawn from the sheets. It was no uncommon sight to come upon a whole herd of swine frozen immovable upon the road. The fields were full of shepherds, ploughmen, teams of horses, and little bird-scaring boys all struck stark in the act of the moment, one with his hand to his nose, another with the bottle to his lips, a third with a stone raised to throw at the ravens who sat, as if stuffed, upon the hedge within a yard of him. The severity of the frost was so extraordinary that a kind of petrifaction sometimes ensued; and it was commonly supposed that the great increase of rocks in some parts of Derbyshire was due to no eruption, for there was none, but to the solidification of unfortunate wayfarers who had been turned literally to stone where they stood. The Church could give little help in the matter, and though some landowners had these relics blessed, the most part preferred to use them either as landmarks, scratching-posts for sheep, or, when the form of the stone allowed, drinking troughs for cattle, which purposes they serve, admirably for the most part, to this day.",the great frost was  historians tell us  the most severe that has ever visited these islands  birds froze in mid air and fell like stones to the ground  at norwich a young countrywoman started to cross the road in her usual robust health and was seen by the onlookers to turn visibly to powder and be blown in a puff of dust over the roofs as the icy blast struck her at the street corner  the mortality among sheep and cattle was enormous  corpses froze and could not be drawn from the sheets  it was no uncommon sight to come upon a whole herd of swine frozen immovable upon the road  the fields were full of shepherds  ploughmen  teams of horses  and little bird scaring boys all struck stark in the act of the moment  one with his hand to his nose  another with the bottle to his lips  a third with a stone raised to throw at the ravens who sat  as if stuffed  upon the hedge within a yard of him  the severity of the frost was so extraordinary that a kind of petrifaction sometimes ensued  and it was commonly supposed that the great increase of rocks in some parts of derbyshire was due to no eruption  for there was none  but to the solidification of unfortunate wayfarers who had been turned literally to stone where they stood  the church could give little help in the matter  and though some landowners had these relics blessed  the most part preferred to use them either as landmarks  scratching posts for sheep  or  when the form of the stone allowed  drinking troughs for cattle  which purposes they serve  admirably for the most part  to this day ,1561,282,-0.8999999999999997,-0.45113721682651664,-0.40701754385964906,-0.45113721682651664,-0.2854161469467304,-0.6499999999999997,-0.398351552227661,-0.31724137931034474,-0.398351552227661,-0.21115903368678857,-120.25573861477415,-1.7032911806350564,-1.735565318327746,-1.7032911806350564,-0.887459892473444,-2.222333333333335,-1.1439144662480736,-1.1964784784704052,-1.1439144662480736,-0.6507572220703803,17.384999999999994,2.0432067365771753,1.932776532898757,2.0432067365771753,0.8506733494179171,-31.943801030081165,-1.39307155782324,-1.4816585414922891,-1.39307155782324,-0.8098893507736249,1.7383778894014337,0.8869183579176688,0.9698825149196781,0.8869183579176688,0.5408387289012875,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.9119}",0.9119,1.0447695700647976,0.46768285477962906,1.0447695700647976,0.19246463410667494,0.10579710144927537,-0.05529313668277342,-0.021045325463435963,-0.05529313668277342,-0.053527661349137626,0.641649496831525,0.7114587173562062,0.6315644137742792,0.7114587173562062,0.1822638102821915,50.76063437052186,0.7263889752909574,0.6835829290678966,0.7263889752909574,-0.2805920056957357,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,-0.021779082047733336
25,25,0,"But while the country people suffered the extremity of want, and the trade of the country was at a standstill, London enjoyed a carnival of the utmost brilliancy. The Court was at Greenwich, and the new King seized the opportunity that his coronation gave him to curry favour with the citizens. He directed that the river, which was frozen to a depth of twenty feet and more for six or seven miles on either side, should be swept, decorated and given all the semblance of a park or pleasure ground, with arbours, mazes, alleys, drinking booths, etc. at his expense. For himself and the courtiers, he reserved a certain space immediately opposite the Palace gates; which, railed off from the public only by a silken rope, became at once the centre of the most brilliant society in England. Great statesmen, in their beards and ruffs, despatched affairs of state under the crimson awning of the Royal Pagoda. Soldiers planned the conquest of the Moor and the downfall of the Turk in striped arbours surmounted by plumes of ostrich feathers. Admirals strode up and down the narrow pathways, glass in hand, sweeping the horizon and telling stories of the north-west passage and the Spanish Armada. Lovers dallied upon divans spread with sables. Frozen roses fell in showers when the Queen and her ladies walked abroad. Coloured balloons hovered motionless in the air. Here and there burnt vast bonfires of cedar and oak wood, lavishly salted, so that the flames were of green, orange, and purple fire. But however fiercely they burnt, the heat was not enough to melt the ice which, though of singular transparency, was yet of the hardness of steel. So clear indeed was it that there could be seen, congealed at a depth of several feet, here a porpoise, there a flounder. Shoals of eels lay motionless in a trance, but whether their state was one of death or merely of suspended animation which the warmth would revive puzzled the philosophers. Near London Bridge, where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty fathoms, a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible, lying on the bed of the river where it had sunk last autumn, overladen with apples. The old bumboat woman, who was carrying her fruit to market on the Surrey side, sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap full of apples, for all the world as if she were about to serve a customer, though a certain blueness about the lips hinted the truth. 'Twas a sight King James specially liked to look upon, and he would bring a troupe of courtiers to gaze with him. In short, nothing could exceed the brilliancy and gaiety of the scene by day. But it was at night that the carnival was at its merriest. For the frost continued unbroken; the nights were of perfect stillness; the moon and stars blazed with the hard fixity of diamonds, and to the fine music of flute and trumpet the courtiers danced.",but while the country people suffered the extremity of want  and the trade of the country was at a standstill  london enjoyed a carnival of the utmost brilliancy  the court was at greenwich  and the new king seized the opportunity that his coronation gave him to curry favour with the citizens  he directed that the river  which was frozen to a depth of twenty feet and more for six or seven miles on either side  should be swept  decorated and given all the semblance of a park or pleasure ground  with arbours  mazes  alleys  drinking booths  etc  at his expense  for himself and the courtiers  he reserved a certain space immediately opposite the palace gates  which  railed off from the public only by a silken rope  became at once the centre of the most brilliant society in england  great statesmen  in their beards and ruffs  despatched affairs of state under the crimson awning of the royal pagoda  soldiers planned the conquest of the moor and the downfall of the turk in striped arbours surmounted by plumes of ostrich feathers  admirals strode up and down the narrow pathways  glass in hand  sweeping the horizon and telling stories of the north west passage and the spanish armada  lovers dallied upon divans spread with sables  frozen roses fell in showers when the queen and her ladies walked abroad  coloured balloons hovered motionless in the air  here and there burnt vast bonfires of cedar and oak wood  lavishly salted  so that the flames were of green  orange  and purple fire  but however fiercely they burnt  the heat was not enough to melt the ice which  though of singular transparency  was yet of the hardness of steel  so clear indeed was it that there could be seen  congealed at a depth of several feet  here a porpoise  there a flounder  shoals of eels lay motionless in a trance  but whether their state was one of death or merely of suspended animation which the warmth would revive puzzled the philosophers  near london bridge  where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty fathoms  a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible  lying on the bed of the river where it had sunk last autumn  overladen with apples  the old bumboat woman  who was carrying her fruit to market on the surrey side  sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap full of apples  for all the world as if she were about to serve a customer  though a certain blueness about the lips hinted the truth  it was a sight king james specially liked to look upon  and he would bring a troupe of courtiers to gaze with him  in short  nothing could exceed the brilliancy and gaiety of the scene by day  but it was at night that the carnival was at its merriest  for the frost continued unbroken  the nights were of perfect stillness  the moon and stars blazed with the hard fixity of diamonds  and to the fine music of flute and trumpet the courtiers danced ,2865,504,2.9000000000000004,0.524707286032072,0.6596491228070177,0.524707286032072,0.011870051146291602,1.5000000000000004,0.16350777365372984,0.27586206896551735,0.16350777365372984,-0.045935146307396174,13.83788730014982,0.22798147614818623,0.19971235929124648,0.22798147614818623,0.0571388224373989,-2.0089285714285707,-1.0508227450782595,-1.0932018687270515,-1.0508227450782595,-0.413432400582058,16.903000000000002,1.9646067190184815,1.8673185305900732,1.9646067190184815,0.16325474994805994,18.488233571604994,0.13009939562516554,0.36681021280962284,0.13009939562516554,-0.17327108609546013,3.319351660750771,1.9244827730561975,1.8519455155635236,1.9244827730561975,0.5778238064863275,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.9967}",0.9967,1.1735464026274167,0.5344834377092442,1.1735464026274167,0.015651682689173965,0.16233645983645983,0.3229202602925773,0.28560168242608264,0.3229202602925773,-0.09381388899840688,0.83816337968135,1.2023059043375934,0.9744083222820213,1.2023059043375934,-0.012074543298132304,82.35153405957865,1.9745119272235734,1.5961686926254335,1.9745119272235734,-0.4748424893334989,-0.5045,-0.23595228939099153,0.21425898981500724,-0.23595228939099153,0.18574564255410506
26,26,0,"Orlando, it is true, was none of those who tread lightly the corantoe and lavolta; he was clumsy and a little absentminded. He much preferred the plain dances of his own country, which he danced as a child to these fantastic foreign measures. He had indeed just brought his feet together about six in the evening of the seventh of January at the finish of some such quadrille or minuet when he beheld, coming from the pavilion of the Muscovite Embassy, a figure, which, whether boy's or woman's, for the loose tunic and trousers of the Russian fashion served to disguise the sex, filled him with the highest curiosity. The person, whatever the name or sex, was about middle height, very slenderly fashioned, and dressed entirely in oyster-coloured velvet, trimmed with some unfamiliar greenish-coloured fur. But these details were obscured by the extraordinary seductiveness which issued from the whole person. Images, metaphors of the most extreme and extravagant twined and twisted in his mind. He called her a melon, a pineapple, an olive tree, an emerald, and a fox in the snow all in the space of three seconds; he did not know whether he had heard her, tasted her, seen her, or all three together. (For though we must pause not a moment in the narrative we may here hastily note that all his images at this time were simple in the extreme to match his senses and were mostly taken from things he had liked the taste of as a boy. But if his senses were simple they were at the same time extremely strong. To pause therefore and seek the reasons of things is out of the question.)...A melon, an emerald, a fox in the snow--so he raved, so he stared. When the boy, for alas, a boy it must be--no woman could skate with such speed and vigour--swept almost on tiptoe past him, Orlando was ready to tear his hair with vexation that the person was of his own sex, and thus all embraces were out of the question. But the skater came closer. Legs, hands, carriage, were a boy's, but no boy ever had a mouth like that; no boy had those breasts; no boy had eyes which looked as if they had been fished from the bottom of the sea. Finally, coming to a stop and sweeping a curtsey with the utmost grace to the King, who was shuffling past on the arm of some Lord-in-waiting, the unknown skater came to a standstill. She was not a handsbreadth off. She was a woman. Orlando stared; trembled; turned hot; turned cold; longed to hurl himself through the summer air; to crush acorns beneath his feet; to toss his arm with the beech trees and the oaks.

28,28,0,"It was through this accident that Orlando and the Princess became acquainted. They were seated opposite each other at the great table spread under a huge awning for the entertainment of the notables. The Princess was placed between two young Lords, one Lord Francis Vere and the other the young Earl of Moray. It was laughable to see the predicament she soon had them in, for though both were fine lads in their way, the babe unborn had as much knowledge of the French tongue as they had. When at the beginning of dinner the Princess turned to the Earl and said, with a grace which ravished his heart, 'Je crois avoir fait la connaissance d'un gentilhomme qui vous etait apparente en Pologne l'ete dernier,' or 'La beaute des dames de la cour d'Angleterre me met dans le ravissement. On ne peut voir une dame plus gracieuse que votre reine, ni une coiffure plus belle que la sienne,' both Lord Francis and the Earl showed the highest embarrassment. The one helped her largely to horse-radish sauce, the other whistled to his dog and made him beg for a marrow bone. At this the Princess could no longer contain her laughter, and Orlando, catching her eyes across the boars' heads and stuffed peacocks, laughed too. He laughed, but the laugh on his lips froze in wonder. Whom had he loved, what had he loved, he asked himself in a tumult of emotion, until now? An old woman, he answered, all skin and bone. Red-cheeked trulls too many to mention. A puling nun. A hard-bitten cruel-mouthed adventuress. A nodding mass of lace and ceremony. Love had meant to him nothing but sawdust and cinders. The joys he had had of it tasted insipid in the extreme. He marvelled how he could have gone through with it without yawning. For as he looked the thickness of his blood melted; the ice turned to wine in his veins; he heard the waters flowing and the birds singing; spring broke over the hard wintry landscape; his manhood woke; he grasped a sword in his hand; he charged a more daring foe than Pole or Moor; he dived in deep water; he saw the flower of danger growing in a crevice; he stretched his hand--in fact he was rattling off one of his most impassioned sonnets when the Princess addressed him, 'Would you have the goodness to pass the salt?'",it was through this accident that orlando and the princess became acquainted  they were seated opposite each other at the great table spread under a huge awning for the entertainment of the notables  the princess was placed between two young lords  one lord francis vere and the other the young earl of moray  it was laughable to see the predicament she soon had them in  for though both were fine lads in their way  the babe unborn had as much knowledge of the french tongue as they had  when at the beginning of dinner the princess turned to the earl and said  with a grace which ravished his heart   je crois avoir fait la connaissance d un gentilhomme qui vous etait apparente en pologne l ete dernier   or  la beaute des dames de la cour d angleterre me met dans le ravissement  on ne peut voir une dame plus gracieuse que votre reine  ni une coiffure plus belle que la sienne   both lord francis and the earl showed the highest embarrassment  the one helped her largely to horse radish sauce  the other whistled to his dog and made him beg for a marrow bone  at this the princess could no longer contain her laughter  and orlando  catching her eyes across the boars  heads and stuffed peacocks  laughed too  he laughed  but the laugh on his lips froze in wonder  whom had he loved  what had he loved  he asked himself in a tumult of emotion  until now  an old woman  he answered  all skin and bone  red cheeked trulls too many to mention  a puling nun  a hard bitten cruel mouthed adventuress  a nodding mass of lace and ceremony  love had meant to him nothing but sawdust and cinders  the joys he had had of it tasted insipid in the extreme  he marvelled how he could have gone through with it without yawning  for as he looked the thickness of his blood melted  the ice turned to wine in his veins  he heard the waters flowing and the birds singing  spring broke over the hard wintry landscape  his manhood woke  he grasped a sword in his hand  he charged a more daring foe than pole or moor  he dived in deep water  he saw the flower of danger growing in a crevice  he stretched his hand  in fact he was rattling off one of his most impassioned sonnets when the princess addressed him   would you have the goodness to pass the salt  ,2242,404,10.499999999999998,2.476396291749248,2.7929824561403502,2.476396291749248,0.6843814681146088,7.499999999999999,1.7314872877413319,1.9310344827586206,1.7314872877413319,0.44174934118148396,14.242937962777841,0.23381518572243357,0.20555816665412685,0.23381518572243357,0.0733686031291272,-0.3354166666666659,-0.32080106129791514,-0.2833106819217534,-0.32080106129791514,-0.22113424911671853,11.478000000000002,1.0799488450435428,1.1305764921572627,1.0799488450435428,0.03788628554482887,62.4179853055767,1.4568854823230888,1.9769529347090875,1.4568854823230888,0.3268955082336489,1.1435996238674504,0.4965761685661197,0.6380415248146483,0.4965761685661197,0.24835067285594212,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9831}",0.9831,1.1528935143862418,0.5237701366733626,1.1528935143862418,0.07981635298475544,0.18430059523809522,0.46984676421558647,0.40472642303011447,0.46984676421558647,0.007976760249590821,0.9778803208008028,1.5512871901764962,1.2181626132434649,1.5512871901764962,0.22832858542446985,68.45260605720883,1.425380018421812,1.1946618046127544,1.425380018421812,-0.40417588099323515,0.9009,1.3830443853264822,0.9932515762488741,1.3830443853264822,0.4492291969443773

33,33,0,"Soon it was observed Orlando paid the Muscovite far more attention than mere civility demanded. He was seldom far from her side, and their conversation, though unintelligible to the rest, was carried on with such animation, provoked such blushes and laughter, that the dullest could guess the subject. Moreover, the change in Orlando himself was extraordinary. Nobody had ever seen him so animated. In one night he had thrown off his boyish clumsiness; he was changed from a sulky stripling, who could not enter a ladies' room without sweeping half the ornaments from the table, to a nobleman, full of grace and manly courtesy. To see him hand the Muscovite (as she was called) to her sledge, or offer her his hand for the dance, or catch the spotted kerchief which she had let drop, or discharge any other of those manifold duties which the supreme lady exacts and the lover hastens to anticipate was a sight to kindle the dull eyes of age, and to make the quick pulse of youth beat faster. Yet over it all hung a cloud. The old men shrugged their shoulders. The young tittered between their fingers. All knew that a Orlando was betrothed to another. The Lady Margaret O'Brien O'Dare O'Reilly Tyrconnel (for that was the proper name of Euphrosyne of the Sonnets) wore Orlando's splendid sapphire on the second finger of her left hand. It was she who had the supreme right to his attentions. Yet she might drop all the handkerchiefs in her wardrobe (of which she had many scores) upon the ice and Orlando never stooped to pick them up. She might wait twenty minutes for him to hand her to her sledge, and in the end have to be content with the services of her Blackamoor. When she skated, which she did rather clumsily, no one was at her elbow to encourage her, and, if she fell, which she did rather heavily, no one raised her to her feet and dusted the snow from her petticoats. Although she was naturally phlegmatic, slow to take offence, and more reluctant than most people to believe that a mere foreigner could oust her from Orlando's affections, still even the Lady Margaret herself was brought at last to suspect that something was brewing against her peace of mind.",soon it was observed orlando paid the muscovite far more attention than mere civility demanded  he was seldom far from her side  and their conversation  though unintelligible to the rest  was carried on with such animation  provoked such blushes and laughter  that the dullest could guess the subject  moreover  the change in orlando himself was extraordinary  nobody had ever seen him so animated  in one night he had thrown off his boyish clumsiness  he was changed from a sulky stripling  who could not enter a ladies  room without sweeping half the ornaments from the table  to a nobleman  full of grace and manly courtesy  to see him hand the muscovite  as she was called  to her sledge  or offer her his hand for the dance  or catch the spotted kerchief which she had let drop  or discharge any other of those manifold duties which the supreme lady exacts and the lover hastens to anticipate was a sight to kindle the dull eyes of age  and to make the quick pulse of youth beat faster  yet over it all hung a cloud  the old men shrugged their shoulders  the young tittered between their fingers  all knew that a orlando was betrothed to another  the lady margaret o brien o dare o reilly tyrconnel  for that was the proper name of euphrosyne of the sonnets  wore orlando own splendid sapphire on the second finger of her left hand  it was she who had the supreme right to his attentions  yet she might drop all the handkerchiefs in her wardrobe  of which she had many scores  upon the ice and orlando never stooped to pick them up  she might wait twenty minutes for him to hand her to her sledge  and in the end have to be content with the services of her blackamoor  when she skated  which she did rather clumsily  no one was at her elbow to encourage her  and  if she fell  which she did rather heavily  no one raised her to her feet and dusted the snow from her petticoats  although she was naturally phlegmatic  slow to take offence  and more reluctant than most people to believe that a mere foreigner could oust her from orlando own affections  still even the lady margaret herself was brought at last to suspect that something was brewing against her peace of mind ,2174,385,7.3999999999999995,1.6803126183646109,1.9228070175438596,1.6803126183646109,0.45941529754569777,5.4,1.1826944578106713,1.3517241379310345,1.1826944578106713,0.29976351005514595,71.77569160176743,1.062426040372021,1.0358873720119604,1.062426040372021,0.3879794199445398,3.370833333333335,1.295944453216869,1.5103181548711293,1.295944453216869,0.3629787171054658,16.339,1.8726349142402567,1.7907245195898691,1.8726349142402567,0.380921917108752,93.94877953391077,2.4091926871993983,3.132640750791168,2.4091926871993983,0.7069454940946873,0.8242464640283815,0.28699048124110943,0.4598667748361431,0.28699048124110943,0.18783177623659952,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9748}",0.9748,1.140289178180231,0.5172318720705819,1.140289178180231,0.09368599071092285,0.13018433179723501,0.10784237627368154,0.11122131905174758,0.10784237627368154,-0.08163411344150268,0.5498048205884725,0.4820515104996314,0.47132948623554866,0.4820515104996314,-0.08664438926659856,64.12637490140808,1.2544552124153738,1.0696873024142481,1.2544552124153738,-0.4378073309223784,-0.8846,-0.6738209645440526,0.003575140303471126,-0.6738209645440526,0.08000210594823837
34,34,0,"Indeed, as the days passed, Orlando took less and less care to hide his feelings. Making some excuse or other, he would leave the company as soon as they had dined, or steal away from the skaters, who were forming sets for a quadrille. Next moment it would be seen that the Muscovite was missing too. But what most outraged the Court, and stung it in its tenderest part, which is its vanity, was that the couple was often seen to slip under the silken rope, which railed off the Royal enclosure from the public part of the river and to disappear among the crowd of common people. For suddenly the Princess would stamp her foot and cry, 'Take me away. I detest your English mob,' by which she meant the English Court itself. She could stand it no longer. It was full of prying old women, she said, who stared in one's face, and of bumptious young men who trod on one's toes. They smelt bad. Their dogs ran between her legs. It was like being in a cage. In Russia they had rivers ten miles broad on which one could gallop six horses abreast all day long without meeting a soul. Besides, she wanted to see the Tower, the Beefeaters, the Heads on Temple Bar, and the jewellers' shops in the city. Thus, it came about that Orlando took her into the city, showed her the Beefeaters and the rebels' heads, and bought her whatever took her fancy in the Royal Exchange. But this was not enough. Each increasingly desired the other's company in privacy all day long where there were none to marvel or to stare. Instead of taking the road to London, therefore, they turned the other way about and were soon beyond the crowd among the frozen reaches of the Thames where, save for sea birds and some old country woman hacking at the ice in a vain attempt to draw a pailful of water or gathering what sticks or dead leaves she could find for firing, not a living soul ever came their way. The poor kept closely to their cottages, and the better sort, who could afford it, crowded for warmth and merriment to the city.",indeed  as the days passed  orlando took less and less care to hide his feelings  making some excuse or other  he would leave the company as soon as they had dined  or steal away from the skaters  who were forming sets for a quadrille  next moment it would be seen that the muscovite was missing too  but what most outraged the court  and stung it in its tenderest part  which is its vanity  was that the couple was often seen to slip under the silken rope  which railed off the royal enclosure from the public part of the river and to disappear among the crowd of common people  for suddenly the princess would stamp her foot and cry   take me away  i detest your english mob   by which she meant the english court itself  she could stand it no longer  it was full of prying old women  she said  who stared in one own face  and of bumptious young men who trod on one own toes  they smelt bad  their dogs ran between her legs  it was like being in a cage  in russia they had rivers ten miles broad on which one could gallop six horses abreast all day long without meeting a soul  besides  she wanted to see the tower  the beefeaters  the heads on temple bar  and the jewellers  shops in the city  thus  it came about that orlando took her into the city  showed her the beefeaters and the rebels  heads  and bought her whatever took her fancy in the royal exchange  but this was not enough  each increasingly desired the other own company in privacy all day long where there were none to marvel or to stare  instead of taking the road to london  therefore  they turned the other way about and were soon beyond the crowd among the frozen reaches of the thames where  save for sea birds and some old country woman hacking at the ice in a vain attempt to draw a pailful of water or gathering what sticks or dead leaves she could find for firing  not a living soul ever came their way  the poor kept closely to their cottages  and the better sort  who could afford it  crowded for warmth and merriment to the city ,2003,373,-7.799999999999997,-2.2230653930697426,-2.3438596491228063,-2.2230653930697426,-0.8743097718235187,-6.8,-2.0055305541674535,-2.013793103448276,-2.0055305541674535,-0.7094002857309761,-72.15434994107088,-1.0105148009601197,-1.0413522777932624,-1.0105148009601197,-0.40257399701384583,-1.8926071428571425,-1.0000808502020886,-1.036908453921613,-1.0000808502020886,-0.4797336745497034,7.425000000000001,0.4190238011319433,0.5801588918313304,0.4190238011319433,-0.17008413927031937,0.0,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3108329231308982,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3290008949455372,-1.6584877944731573,-1.3423829881669018,-0.9253099241966748,-1.3423829881669018,-0.3901001794837488,"{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9622}",-0.9622,-1.8012288014635573,-1.0086257828193312,-1.8012288014635573,-0.6258316323235114,-0.001478494623655923,-0.7729006363196187,-0.6028655210528029,-0.7729006363196187,-0.3413267641437135,-0.007716583121635786,-0.910510728485534,-0.5013387769566595,-0.910510728485534,-0.5464422674620647,61.69574595440145,1.1584236398343095,0.9994722279667965,1.1584236398343095,-0.45135133386724996,-1.0,-0.8067597835723693,-0.06038938543615332,-0.8067597835723693,0.0487437394184935
35,35,0,"Hence, Orlando and Sasha, as he called her for short, and because it was the name of a white Russian fox he had had as a boy--a creature soft as snow, but with teeth of steel, which bit him so savagely that his father had it killed--hence, they had the river to themselves. Hot with skating and with love they would throw themselves down in some solitary reach, where the yellow osiers fringed the bank, and wrapped in a great fur cloak Orlando would take her in his arms, and know, for the first time, he murmured, the delights of love. Then, when the ecstasy was over and they lay lulled in a swoon on the ice, he would tell her of his other loves, and how, compared with her, they had been of wood, of sackcloth, and of cinders. And laughing at his vehemence, she would turn once more in his arms and give him for love's sake, one more embrace.

But Sasha who after all had no English blood in her but was from Russia where the sunsets are longer, the dawns less sudden, and sentences often left unfinished from doubt as to how best to end them--Sasha stared at him, perhaps sneered at him, for he must have seemed a child to her, and said nothing. But at length the ice grew cold beneath them, which she disliked, so pulling him to his feet again, she talked so enchantingly, so wittily, so wisely (but unfortunately always in French, which notoriously loses its flavour in translation) that he forgot the frozen waters or night coming or the old woman or whatever it was, and would try to tell her--plunging and splashing among a thousand images which had gone as stale as the women who inspired them--what she was like. Snow, cream, marble, cherries, alabaster, golden wire? None of these. She was like a fox, or an olive tree; like the waves of the sea when you look down upon them from a height; like an emerald; like the sun on a green hill which is yet clouded--like nothing he had seen or known in England. Ransack the language as he might, words failed him. He wanted another landscape, and another tongue. English was too frank, too candid, too honeyed a speech for Sasha. For in all she said, however open she seemed and voluptuous, there was something hidden; in all she did, however daring, there was something concealed. So the green flame seems hidden in the emerald, or the sun prisoned in a hill. The clearness was only outward; within was a wandering flame.

When Orlando had done telling her that she was a fox, an olive tree, or a green hill-top, and had given her the whole history of his family; how their house was one of the most ancient in Britain; how they had come from Rome with the Caesars and had the right to walk down the Corso (which is the chief street in Rome) under a tasselled palanquin, which he said is a privilege reserved only for those of imperial blood (for there was an orgulous credulity about him which was pleasant enough), he would pause and ask her, Where was her own house?

He suspected at first that her rank was not as high as she would like; or that she was ashamed of the savage ways of her people, for he had heard that the women in Muscovy wear beards and the men are covered with fur from the waist down; that both sexes are smeared with tallow to keep the cold out, tear meat with their fingers and live in huts where an English noble would scruple to keep his cattle; so that he forebore to press her.

Among them was the ship of the Muscovite Embassy flying its double-headed black eagle from the main mast, which was hung with many-coloured icicles several yards in length. Sasha had left some of her clothing on board, and supposing the ship to be empty they climbed on deck and went in search of it. Remembering certain passages in his own past, Orlando would not have marvelled had some good citizens sought this refuge before them; and so it turned out.

Obstacles there were and hardships to overcome. She was determined to live in Russia, where there were frozen rivers and wild horses and men, she said, who gashed each other's throats open. It is true that a landscape of pine and snow, habits of lust and slaughter, did not entice him. Nor was he anxious to cease his pleasant country ways of sport and tree-planting; relinquish his office; ruin his career; shoot the reindeer instead of the rabbit; drink vodka instead of canary, and slip a knife up his sleeve--for what purpose, he knew not. Still, all this and more than all this he would do for her sake. As for his marriage to the Lady Margaret, fixed though it was for this day sennight, the thing was so palpably absurd that he scarcely gave it a thought. Her kinsmen would abuse him for deserting a great lady; his friends would deride him for ruining the finest career in the world for a Cossack woman and a waste of snow--it weighed not a straw in the balance compared with Sasha herself.

43,43,0,"He was recalled, turning westward, by the sight of the sun, slung like an orange on the cross of St Paul's. It was blood-red and sinking rapidly. It must be almost evening. Sasha had been gone this hour and more. Seized instantly with those dark forebodings which shadowed even his most confident thoughts of her, he plunged the way he had seen them go into the hold of the ship; and, after stumbling among chests and barrels in the darkness, was made aware by a faint glimmer in a corner that they were seated there. For one second, he had a vision of them; saw Sasha seated on the sailor's knee; saw her bend towards him; saw them embrace before the light was blotted out in a red cloud by his rage. He blazed into such a howl of anguish that the whole ship echoed. Sasha threw herself between them, or the sailor would have been stifled before he could draw his cutlass. Then a deadly sickness came over Orlando, and they had to lay him on the floor and give him brandy to drink before he revived. And then, when he had recovered and was sat upon a heap of sacking on deck, Sasha hung over him, passing before his dizzied eyes softly, sinuously, like the fox that had bit him, now cajoling, now denouncing, so that he came to doubt what he had seen. Had not the candle guttered; had not the shadows moved? The box was heavy, she said; the man was helping her to move it. Orlando believed her one moment--for who can be sure that his rage has not painted what he most dreads to find?--the next was the more violent with anger at her deceit. Then Sasha herself turned white; stamped her foot on deck; said she would go that night, and called upon her Gods to destroy her, if she, a Romanovitch, had lain in the arms of a common seaman. Indeed, looking at them together (which he could hardly bring himself to do) Orlando was outraged by the foulness of his imagination that could have painted so frail a creature in the paw of that hairy sea brute. The man was huge; stood six feet four in his stockings, wore common wire rings in his ears; and looked like a dray horse upon which some wren or robin has perched in its flight. So he yielded; believed her; and asked her pardon. Yet when they were going down the ship's side, lovingly again, Sasha paused with her hand on the ladder, and called back to this tawny wide-cheeked monster a volley of Russian greetings, jests, or endearments, not a word of which Orlando could understand. But there was something in her tone (it might be the fault of the Russian consonants) that reminded Orlando of a scene some nights since, when he had come upon her in secret gnawing a candle-end in a corner, which she had picked from the floor. True, it was pink; it was gilt; and it was from the King's table; but it was tallow, and she gnawed it. Was there not, he thought, handing her on to the ice, something rank in her, something coarse flavoured, something peasant born? And he fancied her at forty grown unwieldy though she was now slim as a reed, and lethargic though she was now blithe as a lark.

Seldom would she talk about her past life, but now she told him how, in winter in Russia, she would listen to the wolves howling across the steppes, and thrice, to show him, she barked like a wolf. Upon which he told her of the stags in the snow at home, and how they would stray into the great hall for warmth and be fed by an old man with porridge from a bucket. And then she praised him; for his love of beasts; for his gallantry; for his legs. Ravished with her praises and shamed to think how he had maligned her by fancying her on the knees of a common sailor and grown fat and lethargic at forty, he told her that he could find no words to praise her; yet instantly bethought him how she was like the spring and green grass and rushing waters, and seizing her more tightly than ever, he swung her with him half across the river so that the gulls and the cormorants swung too. And halting at length, out of breath, she said, panting slightly, that he was like a million-candled Christmas tree (such as they have in Russia) hung with yellow globes; incandescent; enough to light a whole street by; (so one might translate it) for what with his glowing cheeks, his dark curls, his black and crimson cloak, he looked as if he were burning with his own radiance, from a lamp lit within.",sasha  as if to reassure him  was tenderer than usual and even more delightful  seldom would she talk about her past life  but now she told him how  in winter in russia  she would listen to the wolves howling across the steppes  and thrice  to show him  she barked like a wolf  upon which he told her of the stags in the snow at home  and how they would stray into the great hall for warmth and be fed by an old man with porridge from a bucket  and then she praised him  for his love of beasts  for his gallantry  for his legs  ravished with her praises and shamed to think how he had maligned her by fancying her on the knees of a common sailor and grown fat and lethargic at forty  he told her that he could find no words to praise her  yet instantly bethought him how she was like the spring and green grass and rushing waters  and seizing her more tightly than ever  he swung her with him half across the river so that the gulls and the cormorants swung too  and halting at length  out of breath  she said  panting slightly  that he was like a million candled christmas tree  such as they have in russia  hung with yellow globes  incandescent  enough to light a whole street by   so one might translate it  for what with his glowing cheeks  his dark curls  his black and crimson cloak  he looked as if he were burning with his own radiance  from a lamp lit within ,1368,259,1.85,0.25506604182114606,0.3649122807017544,0.25506604182114606,0.058027275862008565,2.85,0.5163031643234403,0.6482758620689656,0.5163031643234403,0.20521501447482493,121.93854922299712,1.7848925606781867,1.7598521237857518,1.7848925606781867,0.9797906542328636,-1.8789166666666661,-0.9941087716934818,-1.0302829880505397,-0.9941087716934818,-0.6126044584828156,7.3560000000000025,0.4077719313984375,0.5707883479323695,0.4077719313984375,0.03765772617185863,44.985175881033456,0.930371944604781,1.3379939124234648,0.930371944604781,0.4083539301336428,4.416429262338676,2.6444749074491813,2.464031293792387,2.6444749074491813,1.4960434839879118,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9923}",0.9923,1.1668645858435072,0.531017369727047,1.1668645858435072,0.2765823445211073,0.12597402597402604,0.07967803000013227,0.08838629368507325,0.07967803000013227,0.03089907729264407,0.49750259573231886,0.3514123944676628,0.3800814841438203,0.3514123944676628,0.06975644895362743,46.10752149881578,0.542549419270929,0.5491655935459122,0.542549419270929,-0.30376367430571216,0.8381,1.3106998633595992,0.9584424582553869,1.3106998633595992,0.5312650360810763
46,46,0,"All the colour, save the red of Orlando's cheeks, soon faded. Night came on. As the orange light of sunset vanished it was succeeded by an astonishing white glare from the torches, bonfires, flaming cressets, and other devices by which the river was lit up and the strangest transformation took place. Various churches and noblemen's palaces, whose fronts were of white stone showed in streaks and patches as if floating on the air. Of St Paul's, in particular, nothing was left but a gilt cross. The Abbey appeared like the grey skeleton of a leaf. Everything suffered emaciation and transformation. As they approached the carnival, they heard a deep note like that struck on a tuning-fork which boomed louder and louder until it became an uproar. Every now and then a great shout followed a rocket into the air. Gradually they could discern little figures breaking off from the vast crowd and spinning hither and thither like gnats on the surface of a river. Above and around this brilliant circle like a bowl of darkness pressed the deep black of a winter's night. And then into this darkness there began to rise with pauses, which kept the expectation alert and the mouth open, flowering rockets; crescents; serpents; a crown.

47,47,0,"By this time Orlando and the Princess were close to the Royal enclosure and found their way barred by a great crowd of the common people, who were pressing as near to the silken rope as they dared. Loth to end their privacy and encounter the sharp eyes that were on the watch for them, the couple lingered there, shouldered by apprentices; tailors; fishwives; horse dealers, cony catchers; starving scholars; maid-servants in their whimples; orange girls; ostlers; sober citizens; bawdy tapsters; and a crowd of little ragamuffins such as always haunt the outskirts of a crowd, screaming and scrambling among people's feet--all the riff-raff of the London streets indeed was there, jesting and jostling, here casting dice, telling fortunes, shoving, tickling, pinching; here uproarious, there glum; some of them with mouths gaping a yard wide; others as little reverent as daws on a house-top; all as variously rigged out as their purse or stations allowed; here in fur and broadcloth; there in tatters with their feet kept from the ice only by a dishclout bound about them. The main press of people, it appeared, stood opposite a booth or stage something like our Punch and Judy show upon which some kind of theatrical performance was going forward. A black man was waving his arms and vociferating. There was a woman in white laid upon a bed. Rough though the staging was, the actors running up and down a pair of steps and sometimes tripping, and the crowd stamping their feet and whistling, or when they were bored, tossing a piece of orange peel on to the ice which a dog would scramble for, still the astonishing, sinuous melody of the words stirred Orlando like music.

51,51,0,"Long before midnight Orlando was in waiting. The night was of so inky a blackness that a man was on you before he could be seen, which was all to the good, but it was also of the most solemn stillness so that a horse's hoof, or a child's cry, could be heard at a distance of half a mile. Many a time did Orlando, pacing the little courtyard, hold his heart at the sound of some nag's steady footfall on the cobbles, or at the rustle of a woman's dress. But the traveller was only some merchant, making home belated; or some woman of the quarter whose errand was nothing so innocent. They passed, and the street was quieter than before. Then those lights which burnt downstairs in the small, huddled quarters where the poor of the city lived moved up to the sleeping-rooms, and then, one by one, were extinguished. The street lanterns in these purlieus were few at most; and the negligence of the night watchman often suffered them to expire long before dawn. The darkness then became even deeper than before. Orlando looked to the wicks of his lantern, saw to the saddle girths; primed his pistols; examined his holsters; and did all these things a dozen times at least till he could find nothing more needing his attention. Though it still lacked some twenty minutes to midnight, he could not bring himself to go indoors to the inn parlour, where the hostess was still serving sack and the cheaper sort of canary wine to a few seafaring men, who would sit there trolling their ditties, and telling their stories of Drake, Hawkins, and Grenville, till they toppled off the benches and rolled asleep on the sanded floor. The darkness was more compassionate to his swollen and violent heart. He listened to every footfall; speculated on every sound. Each drunken shout and each wail from some poor wretch laid in the straw or in other distress cut his heart to the quick, as if it boded ill omen to his venture. Yet, he had no fear for Sasha. Her courage made nothing of the adventure. She would come alone, in her cloak and trousers, booted like a man. Light as her footfall was, it would hardly be heard, even in this silence.",long before midnight orlando was in waiting  the night was of so inky a blackness that a man was on you before he could be seen  which was all to the good  but it was also of the most solemn stillness so that a horse own hoof  or a child own cry  could be heard at a distance of half a mile  many a time did orlando  pacing the little courtyard  hold his heart at the sound of some nag own steady footfall on the cobbles  or at the rustle of a woman own dress  but the traveller was only some merchant  making home belated  or some woman of the quarter whose errand was nothing so innocent  they passed  and the street was quieter than before  then those lights which burnt downstairs in the small  huddled quarters where the poor of the city lived moved up to the sleeping rooms  and then  one by one  were extinguished  the street lanterns in these purlieus were few at most  and the negligence of the night watchman often suffered them to expire long before dawn  the darkness then became even deeper than before  orlando looked to the wicks of his lantern  saw to the saddle girths  primed his pistols  examined his holsters  and did all these things a dozen times at least till he could find nothing more needing his attention  though it still lacked some twenty minutes to midnight  he could not bring himself to go indoors to the inn parlour  where the hostess was still serving sack and the cheaper sort of canary wine to a few seafaring men  who would sit there trolling their ditties  and telling their stories of drake  hawkins  and grenville  till they toppled off the benches and rolled asleep on the sanded floor  the darkness was more compassionate to his swollen and violent heart  he listened to every footfall  speculated on every sound  each drunken shout and each wail from some poor wretch laid in the straw or in other distress cut his heart to the quick  as if it boded ill omen to his venture  yet  he had no fear for sasha  her courage made nothing of the adventure  she would come alone  in her cloak and trousers  booted like a man  light as her footfall was  it would hardly be heard  even in this silence ,2126,386,-7.199999999999999,-2.068984682092071,-2.1754385964912277,-2.068984682092071,-0.7992466564598049,-9.200000000000001,-2.6327223598024947,-2.6758620689655177,-2.6327223598024947,-0.8847131049620569,-157.84849493703103,-2.2447178284934157,-2.2781147620782787,-2.2447178284934157,-0.8510305953830781,0.4815476190476199,0.03557623231351038,0.11205679234119229,0.03557623231351038,-0.0945227539094695,-9.192,-2.29071995773286,-1.676512528009778,-2.29071995773286,-1.2391829954545752,-43.83573294022059,-1.7522370249508536,-1.9175296051483972,-1.7522370249508536,-0.8111127774166625,-1.9773567734789543,-1.551650916391667,-1.1032145381321985,-1.551650916391667,-0.4494386666895598,"{'neg': 0.136, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.9925}",-0.9925,-1.8472422215891158,-1.032494387333097,-1.8472422215891158,-0.6246518820998502,0.12513440860215055,0.07406150821009151,0.08383254277239861,0.07406150821009151,-0.09223020770677293,0.6488303078460259,0.7293947574750934,0.6440922681872334,0.7293947574750934,-0.00639830463760242,63.440196482449785,1.2273450306145257,1.0498652440820924,1.2273450306145257,-0.46364881835585975,-0.9958,-0.8019214556701256,-0.058061387099009286,-0.8019214556701256,0.05699435465786082
52,52,0,"So he waited in the darkness. Suddenly he was struck in the face by a blow, soft, yet heavy, on the side of his cheek. So strung with expectation was he, that he started and put his hand to his sword. The blow was repeated a dozen times on forehead and cheek. The dry frost had lasted so long that it took him a minute to realize that these were raindrops falling; the blows were the blows of the rain. At first, they fell slowly, deliberately, one by one.

53,53,0,"Hastily putting the horses under cover, he sought shelter beneath the lintel of the door whence he could still observe the courtyard. The air was thicker now than ever, and such a steaming and droning rose from the downpour that no footfall of man or beast could be heard above it. The roads, pitted as they were with great holes, would be under water and perhaps impassable. But of what effect this would have upon their flight he scarcely thought. All his senses were bent upon gazing along the cobbled pathway--gleaming in the light of the lantern--for Sasha's coming. Sometimes, in the darkness, he seemed to see her wrapped about with rain strokes. But the phantom vanished. Suddenly, with an awful and ominous voice, a voice full of horror and alarm which raised every hair of anguish in Orlando's soul, St Paul's struck the first stroke of midnight. Four times more it struck remorselessly. With the superstition of a lover, Orlando had made out that it was on the sixth stroke that she would come. But the sixth stroke echoed away, and the seventh came and the eighth, and to his apprehensive mind they seemed notes first heralding and then proclaiming death and disaster. When the twelfth struck he knew that his doom was sealed. It was useless for the rational part of him to reason; she might be late; she might be prevented; she might have missed her way. The passionate and feeling heart of Orlando knew the truth. Other clocks struck, jangling one after another. The whole world seemed to ring with the news of her deceit and his derision. The old suspicions subterraneously at work in him rushed forth from concealment openly. He was bitten by a swarm of snakes, each more poisonous than the last. He stood in the doorway in the tremendous rain without moving. As the minutes passed, he sagged a little at the knees. The downpour rushed on. In the thick of it, great guns seemed to boom. Huge noises as of the tearing and rending of oak trees could be heard. There were also wild cries and terrible inhuman groanings. But Orlando stood there immovable till Paul's clock struck two, and then, crying aloud with an awful irony, and all his teeth showing, 'Jour de ma vie!' he dashed the lantern to the ground, mounted his horse and galloped he knew not where.",hastily putting the horses under cover  he sought shelter beneath the lintel of the door whence he could still observe the courtyard  the air was thicker now than ever  and such a steaming and droning rose from the downpour that no footfall of man or beast could be heard above it  the roads  pitted as they were with great holes  would be under water and perhaps impassable  but of what effect this would have upon their flight he scarcely thought  all his senses were bent upon gazing along the cobbled pathway  gleaming in the light of the lantern  for sasha own coming  sometimes  in the darkness  he seemed to see her wrapped about with rain strokes  but the phantom vanished  suddenly  with an awful and ominous voice  a voice full of horror and alarm which raised every hair of anguish in orlando own soul  st paul own struck the first stroke of midnight  four times more it struck remorselessly  with the superstition of a lover  orlando had made out that it was on the sixth stroke that she would come  but the sixth stroke echoed away  and the seventh came and the eighth  and to his apprehensive mind they seemed notes first heralding and then proclaiming death and disaster  when the twelfth struck he knew that his doom was sealed  it was useless for the rational part of him to reason  she might be late  she might be prevented  she might have missed her way  the passionate and feeling heart of orlando knew the truth  other clocks struck  jangling one after another  the whole world seemed to ring with the news of her deceit and his derision  the old suspicions subterraneously at work in him rushed forth from concealment openly  he was bitten by a swarm of snakes  each more poisonous than the last  he stood in the doorway in the tremendous rain without moving  as the minutes passed  he sagged a little at the knees  the downpour rushed on  in the thick of it  great guns seemed to boom  huge noises as of the tearing and rending of oak trees could be heard  there were also wild cries and terrible inhuman groanings  but orlando stood there immovable till paul own clock struck two  and then  crying aloud with an awful irony  and all his teeth showing   jour de ma vie   he dashed the lantern to the ground  mounted his horse and galloped he knew not where ,2272,401,-22.65,-6.036562989767122,-6.512280701754386,-6.036562989767122,-2.0564899455998638,-20.650000000000002,-5.6249499325196695,-5.83448275862069,-5.6249499325196695,-1.7501361950799104,-370.9615210461362,-5.314061037916179,-5.353823092170373,-5.314061037916179,-1.9252029746443902,-5.8238095238095235,-2.7149554042809014,-2.939402336888231,-2.7149554042809014,-1.0555319869759376,-3.9210000000000003,-1.4311749524385,-0.9606844571195764,-1.4311749524385,-0.8959677114924768,-137.42430338312283,-4.578841051523729,-5.347800653893757,-4.578841051523729,-1.783877094708436,-5.238333376482448,-3.6917707230523447,-2.922591215722291,-3.6917707230523447,-1.1460972324716994,"{'neg': 0.195, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.997}",-0.997,-1.8540758978453868,-1.0360392295876166,-1.8540758978453868,-0.6126928101043546,0.10063131313131314,-0.08984907087665935,-0.04906250811779028,-0.08984907087665935,-0.14782041293963416,0.5517422174466668,0.48689068920863904,0.47470952586207,0.48689068920863904,-0.10319509116724064,65.15177137000045,1.294967539695629,1.0993085613353326,1.294967539695629,-0.48563512656896357,-0.9986,-0.8051470076049547,-0.05961338599043866,-0.8051470076049547,0.0642945880086442
54,54,0,"Some blind instinct, for he was past reasoning, must have driven him to take the river bank in the direction of the sea. For when the dawn broke, which it did with unusual suddenness, the sky turning a pale yellow and the rain almost ceasing, he found himself on the banks of the Thames off Wapping. Now a sight of the most extraordinary nature met his eyes. Where, for three months and more, there had been solid ice of such thickness that it seemed permanent as stone, and a whole gay city had been stood on its pavement, was now a race of turbulent yellow waters. The river had gained its freedom in the night. It was as if a sulphur spring (to which view many philosophers inclined) had risen from the volcanic regions beneath and burst the ice asunder with such vehemence that it swept the huge and massy fragments furiously apart. The mere look of the water was enough to turn one giddy. All was riot and confusion. The river was strewn with icebergs. Some of these were as broad as a bowling green and as high as a house; others no bigger than a man's hat, but most fantastically twisted. Now would come down a whole convoy of ice blocks sinking everything that stood in their way. Now, eddying and swirling like a tortured serpent, the river would seem to be hurtling itself between the fragments and tossing them from bank to bank, so that they could be heard smashing against the piers and pillars. But what was the most awful and inspiring of terror was the sight of the human creatures who had been trapped in the night and now paced their twisting and precarious islands in the utmost agony of spirit. Whether they jumped into the flood or stayed on the ice their doom was certain. Sometimes quite a cluster of these poor creatures would come down together, some on their knees, others suckling their babies. One old man seemed to be reading aloud from a holy book. At other times, and his fate perhaps was the most dreadful, a solitary wretch would stride his narrow tenement alone. As they swept out to sea, some could be heard crying vainly for help, making wild promises to amend their ways, confessing their sins and vowing altars and wealth if God would hear their prayers. Others were so dazed with terror that they sat immovable and silent looking steadfastly before them. One crew of young watermen or post-boys, to judge by their liveries, roared and shouted the lewdest tavern songs, as if in bravado, and were dashed against a tree and sunk with blasphemies on their lips. An old nobleman--for such his furred gown and golden chain proclaimed him--went down not far from where Orlando stood, calling vengeance upon the Irish rebels, who, he cried with his last breath, had plotted this devilry. Many perished clasping some silver pot or other treasure to their breasts; and at least a score of poor wretches were drowned by their own cupidity, hurling themselves from the bank into the flood rather than let a gold goblet escape them, or see before their eyes the disappearance of some furred gown. For furniture, valuables, possessions of all sorts were carried away on the icebergs. Among other strange sights was to be seen a cat suckling its young; a table laid sumptuously for a supper of twenty; a couple in bed; together with an extraordinary number of cooking utensils.",some blind instinct  for he was past reasoning  must have driven him to take the river bank in the direction of the sea  for when the dawn broke  which it did with unusual suddenness  the sky turning a pale yellow and the rain almost ceasing  he found himself on the banks of the thames off wapping  now a sight of the most extraordinary nature met his eyes  where  for three months and more  there had been solid ice of such thickness that it seemed permanent as stone  and a whole gay city had been stood on its pavement  was now a race of turbulent yellow waters  the river had gained its freedom in the night  it was as if a sulphur spring  to which view many philosophers inclined  had risen from the volcanic regions beneath and burst the ice asunder with such vehemence that it swept the huge and massy fragments furiously apart  the mere look of the water was enough to turn one giddy  all was riot and confusion  the river was strewn with icebergs  some of these were as broad as a bowling green and as high as a house  others no bigger than a man own hat  but most fantastically twisted  now would come down a whole convoy of ice blocks sinking everything that stood in their way  now  eddying and swirling like a tortured serpent  the river would seem to be hurtling itself between the fragments and tossing them from bank to bank  so that they could be heard smashing against the piers and pillars  but what was the most awful and inspiring of terror was the sight of the human creatures who had been trapped in the night and now paced their twisting and precarious islands in the utmost agony of spirit  whether they jumped into the flood or stayed on the ice their doom was certain  sometimes quite a cluster of these poor creatures would come down together  some on their knees  others suckling their babies  one old man seemed to be reading aloud from a holy book  at other times  and his fate perhaps was the most dreadful  a solitary wretch would stride his narrow tenement alone  as they swept out to sea  some could be heard crying vainly for help  making wild promises to amend their ways  confessing their sins and vowing altars and wealth if god would hear their prayers  others were so dazed with terror that they sat immovable and silent looking steadfastly before them  one crew of young watermen or post boys  to judge by their liveries  roared and shouted the lewdest tavern songs  as if in bravado  and were dashed against a tree and sunk with blasphemies on their lips  an old nobleman  for such his furred gown and golden chain proclaimed him  went down not far from where orlando stood  calling vengeance upon the irish rebels  who  he cried with his last breath  had plotted this devilry  many perished clasping some silver pot or other treasure to their breasts  and at least a score of poor wretches were drowned by their own cupidity  hurling themselves from the bank into the flood rather than let a gold goblet escape them  or see before their eyes the disappearance of some furred gown  for furniture  valuables  possessions of all sorts were carried away on the icebergs  among other strange sights was to be seen a cat suckling its young  a table laid sumptuously for a supper of twenty  a couple in bed  together with an extraordinary number of cooking utensils ,3302,586,-10.149999999999999,-2.826548177732291,-3.0035087719298246,-2.826548177732291,-0.7549790137918144,-9.35,-2.6719218476546844,-2.717241379310345,-2.6719218476546844,-0.6382277785903389,-189.6987472769132,-2.7034385248424506,-2.7377867409612504,-2.7034385248424506,-0.6736881060265836,-3.481,-1.6929717849941388,-1.8056065268328483,-1.6929717849941388,-0.5325202077457323,2.417,-0.397633642714415,-0.09995246825558496,-0.397633642714415,-0.555999570733793,-18.31488130349362,-0.9814448047411017,-0.9821222354824632,-0.9814448047411017,-0.46168330765672827,-3.24067945944227,-2.380746684801559,-1.8080524167588505,-2.380746684801559,-0.48518924184176565,"{'neg': 0.141, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.9951}",-0.9951,-1.8511905678705167,-1.0345425184134862,-1.8511905678705167,-0.5017492581651869,0.020600818452380945,-0.62520366487215,-0.4831161025210693,-0.62520366487215,-0.3116316110052314,0.22980034771990712,-0.31724721105192194,-0.08695974314200001,-0.31724721105192194,-0.4154175715537548,90.12175258639456,2.281505022713363,1.8206317777891512,2.281505022713363,-0.5871899763703369,-0.8956,-0.6864927757165957,-0.002521998198572745,-0.6864927757165957,0.14274139507271993

At last, seeming to recollect himself, he clapped spurs to his horse and galloped hard along the river bank in the direction of the sea. Rounding a bend of the river, he came opposite that reach where, not two days ago, the ships of the Ambassadors had seemed immovably frozen. Hastily, he made count of them all; the French; the Spanish; the Austrian; the Turk. All still floated, though the French had broken loose from her moorings, and the Turkish vessel had taken a great rent in her side and was fast filling with water. But the Russian ship was nowhere to be seen.

58,58,1,"In the summer of that disastrous winter which saw the frost, the flood, the deaths of many thousands, and the complete downfall of Orlando's hopes--for he was exiled from Court; in deep disgrace with the most powerful nobles of his time; the Irish house of Desmond was justly enraged; the King had already trouble enough with the Irish not to relish this further addition--in that summer Orlando retired to his great house in the country and there lived in complete solitude. One June morning--it was Saturday the   th--he failed to rise at his usual hour, and when his groom went to call him he was found fast asleep. Nor could he be awakened. He lay as if in a trance, without perceptible breathing; and though dogs were set to bark under his window; cymbals, drums, bones beaten perpetually in his room; a gorse bush put under his pillow; and mustard plasters applied to his feet, still he did not wake, take food, or show any sign of life for seven whole days. On the seventh day he woke at his usual time (a quarter before eight, precisely) and turned the whole posse of caterwauling wives and village soothsayers out of his room, which was natural enough; but what was strange was that he showed no consciousness of any such trance, but dressed himself and sent for his horse as if he had woken from a single night's slumber. Yet some change, it was suspected, must have taken place in the chambers of his brain, for though he was perfectly rational and seemed graver and more sedate in his ways than before, he appeared to have an imperfect recollection of his past life. He would listen when people spoke of the great frost or the skating or the carnival, but he never gave any sign, except by passing his hand across his brow as if to wipe away some cloud, of having witnessed them himself. When the events of the past six months were discussed, he seemed not so much distressed as puzzled, as if he were troubled by confused memories of some time long gone or were trying to recall stories told him by another. It was observed that if Russia was mentioned or Princesses or ships, he would fall into a gloom of an uneasy kind and get up and look out of the window or call one of the dogs to him, or take a knife and carve a piece of cedar wood. But the doctors were hardly wiser then than they are now, and after prescribing rest and exercise, starvation and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner, together with the usual sedatives and irritants, diversified, as the fancy took them, with possets of newt's slobber on rising, and draughts of peacock's gall on going to bed, they left him to himself, and gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a week.",in the summer of that disastrous winter which saw the frost  the flood  the deaths of many thousands  and the complete downfall of orlando own hopes  for he was exiled from court  in deep disgrace with the most powerful nobles of his time  the irish house of desmond was justly enraged  the king had already trouble enough with the irish not to relish this further addition  in that summer orlando retired to his great house in the country and there lived in complete solitude  one june morning  it was saturday the   th  he failed to rise at his usual hour  and when his groom went to call him he was found fast asleep  nor could he be awakened  he lay as if in a trance  without perceptible breathing  and though dogs were set to bark under his window  cymbals  drums  bones beaten perpetually in his room  a gorse bush put under his pillow  and mustard plasters applied to his feet  still he did not wake  take food  or show any sign of life for seven whole days  on the seventh day he woke at his usual time  a quarter before eight  precisely  and turned the whole posse of caterwauling wives and village soothsayers out of his room  which was natural enough  but what was strange was that he showed no consciousness of any such trance  but dressed himself and sent for his horse as if he had woken from a single night own slumber  yet some change  it was suspected  must have taken place in the chambers of his brain  for though he was perfectly rational and seemed graver and more sedate in his ways than before  he appeared to have an imperfect recollection of his past life  he would listen when people spoke of the great frost or the skating or the carnival  but he never gave any sign  except by passing his hand across his brow as if to wipe away some cloud  of having witnessed them himself  when the events of the past six months were discussed  he seemed not so much distressed as puzzled  as if he were troubled by confused memories of some time long gone or were trying to recall stories told him by another  it was observed that if russia was mentioned or princesses or ships  he would fall into a gloom of an uneasy kind and get up and look out of the window or call one of the dogs to him  or take a knife and carve a piece of cedar wood  but the doctors were hardly wiser then than they are now  and after prescribing rest and exercise  starvation and nourishment  society and solitude  that he should lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner  together with the usual sedatives and irritants  diversified  as the fancy took them  with possets of newt own slobber on rising  and draughts of peacock own gall on going to bed  they left him to himself  and gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a week ,2750,502,-1.8499999999999996,-0.6950983425411638,-0.6736842105263157,-0.6950983425411638,-0.3018256917850551,-3.85,-1.2346072930743823,-1.2,-1.2346072930743823,-0.3789859782885015,-110.58260725451977,-1.5639746846117162,-1.595959911534931,-1.5639746846117162,-0.45843222803033135,-5.058531746031745,-2.3811248708360275,-2.5690483968196984,-2.3811248708360275,-0.784581723846913,27.97400000000002,3.7699610642307513,3.370815508929181,3.7699610642307513,0.7058147176986527,30.79877726685242,0.5019079638468281,0.818024516354149,0.5019079638468281,-0.06854354006327547,-2.210150336977445,-1.7044291103987546,-1.233095623366648,-1.7044291103987546,-0.3862698411470701,"{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.6636}",-0.6636,-1.3477764169918818,-0.7734058056638702,-1.3477764169918818,-0.44879293504468015,0.10689935064935065,-0.047919770125993986,-0.015067163899644466,-0.047919770125993986,-0.17666933323289638,0.7532450434753103,0.9901991267124859,0.8262572915932546,0.9901991267124859,-0.0636589235709786,79.72328001240069,1.8706723964700716,1.520244700270827,1.8706723964700716,-0.5284700564802361,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,0.10494253326691452

60,60,1,"Now Orlando gave himself up to a life of extreme solitude. His disgrace at Court and the violence of his grief were partly the reason of it, but as he made no effort to defend himself and seldom invited anyone to visit him (though he had many friends who would willingly have done so) it appeared as if to be alone in the great house of his fathers suited his temper. Solitude was his choice. How he spent his time, nobody quite knew. The servants, of whom he kept a full retinue, though much of their business was to dust empty rooms and to smooth the coverlets of beds that were never slept in, watched, in the dark of the evening, as they sat over their cakes and ale, a light passing along the galleries, through the banqueting-halls, up the staircase, into the bedrooms, and knew that their master was perambulating the house alone. None dared follow him, for the house was haunted by a great variety of ghosts, and the extent of it made it easy to lose one's way and either fall down some hidden staircase or open a door which, should the wind blow it to, would shut upon one for ever--accidents of no uncommon occurrence, as the frequent discovery of the skeletons of men and animals in attitudes of great agony made evident. Then the light would be lost altogether, and Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper, would say to Mr Dupper, the chaplain, how she hoped his Lordship had not met with some bad accident. Mr Dupper would opine that his Lordship was on his knees, no doubt, among the tombs of his ancestors in the Chapel, which was in the Billiard Table Court, half a mile away on the south side. For he had sins on his conscience, Mr Dupper was afraid; upon which Mrs Grimsditch would retort, rather sharply, that so had most of us; and Mrs Stewkley and Mrs Field and old Nurse Carpenter would all raise their voices in his Lordship's praise; and the grooms and the stewards would swear that it was a thousand pities to see so fine a nobleman moping about the house when he might be hunting the fox or chasing the deer; and even the little laundry maids and scullery maids, the Judys and the Faiths, who were handing round the tankards and cakes, would pipe up their testimony to his Lordship's gallantry; for never was there a kinder gentleman, or one more free with those little pieces of silver which serve to buy a knot of ribbon or put a posy in one's hair; until even the Blackamoor whom they called Grace Robinson by way of making a Christian woman of her, understood what they were at, and agreed that his Lordship was a handsome, pleasant, darling gentleman in the only way she could, that is to say by showing all her teeth at once in a broad grin. In short, all his serving men and women held him in high respect, and cursed the foreign Princess (but they called her by a coarser name than that) who had brought him to this pass.",now orlando gave himself up to a life of extreme solitude  his disgrace at court and the violence of his grief were partly the reason of it  but as he made no effort to defend himself and seldom invited anyone to visit him  though he had many friends who would willingly have done so  it appeared as if to be alone in the great house of his fathers suited his temper  solitude was his choice  how he spent his time  nobody quite knew  the servants  of whom he kept a full retinue  though much of their business was to dust empty rooms and to smooth the coverlets of beds that were never slept in  watched  in the dark of the evening  as they sat over their cakes and ale  a light passing along the galleries  through the banqueting halls  up the staircase  into the bedrooms  and knew that their master was perambulating the house alone  none dared follow him  for the house was haunted by a great variety of ghosts  and the extent of it made it easy to lose one own way and either fall down some hidden staircase or open a door which  should the wind blow it to  would shut upon one for ever  accidents of no uncommon occurrence  as the frequent discovery of the skeletons of men and animals in attitudes of great agony made evident  then the light would be lost altogether  and mrs grimsditch  the housekeeper  would say to mr dupper  the chaplain  how she hoped his lordship had not met with some bad accident  mr dupper would opine that his lordship was on his knees  no doubt  among the tombs of his ancestors in the chapel  which was in the billiard table court  half a mile away on the south side  for he had sins on his conscience  mr dupper was afraid  upon which mrs grimsditch would retort  rather sharply  that so had most of us  and mrs stewkley and mrs field and old nurse carpenter would all raise their voices in his lordship own praise  and the grooms and the stewards would swear that it was a thousand pities to see so fine a nobleman moping about the house when he might be hunting the fox or chasing the deer  and even the little laundry maids and scullery maids  the judys and the faiths  who were handing round the tankards and cakes  would pipe up their testimony to his lordship own gallantry  for never was there a kinder gentleman  or one more free with those little pieces of silver which serve to buy a knot of ribbon or put a posy in one own hair  until even the blackamoor whom they called grace robinson by way of making a christian woman of her  understood what they were at  and agreed that his lordship was a handsome  pleasant  darling gentleman in the only way she could  that is to say by showing all her teeth at once in a broad grin  in short  all his serving men and women held him in high respect  and cursed the foreign princess  but they called her by a coarser name than that  who had brought him to this pass ,2847,527,5.55,1.2052304261834559,1.4035087719298245,1.2052304261834559,0.17063639010474438,3.550000000000001,0.6992341076336608,0.8413793103448279,0.6992341076336608,0.07170019554910063,13.739054152947075,0.2265580396986596,0.1982859709578319,0.2265580396986596,0.05425481077743531,3.807837301587302,1.4865749302488453,1.7218049459006703,1.4865749302488453,0.2697516244831137,19.174999999999997,2.3351030673449436,2.1758674543355743,2.3351030673449436,0.2328861567276481,67.57370472032088,1.6126008350486314,2.1659238203648434,1.6126008350486314,0.2153437844041393,-0.3135522901001389,-0.45972620708518214,-0.1749383062999377,-0.45972620708518214,-0.05220018763753124,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': 0.961}",0.961,1.119332570994333,0.5063610224900548,1.119332570994333,-0.006032769900659337,0.1558031400966184,0.27921638527846615,0.2501675528753303,0.27921638527846615,-0.11389557658874201,1.330510604971708,2.432077801606268,1.8333717940408236,2.432077801606268,0.2613965955761154,84.34556603693737,2.053294016443119,1.6537715216846645,2.053294016443119,-0.5139981069284233,-0.9962,-0.8023822488036726,-0.05828310122635631,-0.8023822488036726,0.11322068692845938
61,61,1,"But though it was probably cowardice, or love of hot ale, that led Mr Dupper to imagine his Lordship safe among the tombs so that he need not go in search of him, it may well have been that Mr Dupper was right. Orlando now took a strange delight in thoughts of death and decay, and, after pacing the long galleries and ballrooms with a taper in his hand, looking at picture after picture as if he sought the likeness of somebody whom he could not find, would mount into the family pew and sit for hours watching the banners stir and the moonlight waver with a bat or death's head moth to keep him company. Even this was not enough for him, but he must descend into the crypt where his ancestors lay, coffin piled upon coffin, for ten generations together. The place was so seldom visited that the rats made free with the lead work, and now a thigh bone would catch at his cloak as he passed, or he would crack the skull of some old Sir Malise as it rolled beneath his foot. It was a ghastly sepulchre; dug deep beneath the foundations of the house as if the first Lord of the family, who had come from France with the Conqueror, had wished to testify how all pomp is built upon corruption; how the skeleton lies beneath the flesh: how we that dance and sing above must lie below; how the crimson velvet turns to dust; how the ring (here Orlando, stooping his lantern, would pick up a gold circle lacking a stone, that had rolled into a corner) loses its ruby and the eye which was so lustrous shines no more. 'Nothing remains of all these Princes', Orlando would say, indulging in some pardonable exaggeration of their rank, 'except one digit,' and he would take a skeleton hand in his and bend the joints this way and that. 'Whose hand was it?' he went on to ask. 'The right or the left? The hand of man or woman, of age or youth? Had it urged the war horse, or plied the needle? Had it plucked the rose, or grasped cold steel? Had it--' but here either his invention failed him or, what is more likely, provided him with so many instances of what a hand can do that he shrank, as his wont was, from the cardinal labour of composition, which is excision, and he put it with the other bones, thinking how there was a writer called Thomas Browne, a Doctor of Norwich, whose writing upon such subjects took his fancy amazingly.",but though it was probably cowardice  or love of hot ale  that led mr dupper to imagine his lordship safe among the tombs so that he need not go in search of him  it may well have been that mr dupper was right  orlando now took a strange delight in thoughts of death and decay  and  after pacing the long galleries and ballrooms with a taper in his hand  looking at picture after picture as if he sought the likeness of somebody whom he could not find  would mount into the family pew and sit for hours watching the banners stir and the moonlight waver with a bat or death own head moth to keep him company  even this was not enough for him  but he must descend into the crypt where his ancestors lay  coffin piled upon coffin  for ten generations together  the place was so seldom visited that the rats made free with the lead work  and now a thigh bone would catch at his cloak as he passed  or he would crack the skull of some old sir malise as it rolled beneath his foot  it was a ghastly sepulchre  dug deep beneath the foundations of the house as if the first lord of the family  who had come from france with the conqueror  had wished to testify how all pomp is built upon corruption  how the skeleton lies beneath the flesh  how we that dance and sing above must lie below  how the crimson velvet turns to dust  how the ring  here orlando  stooping his lantern  would pick up a gold circle lacking a stone  that had rolled into a corner  loses its ruby and the eye which was so lustrous shines no more   nothing remains of all these princes   orlando would say  indulging in some pardonable exaggeration of their rank   except one digit   and he would take a skeleton hand in his and bend the joints this way and that   whose hand was it   he went on to ask   the right or the left  the hand of man or woman  of age or youth  had it urged the war horse  or plied the needle  had it plucked the rose  or grasped cold steel  had it    but here either his invention failed him or  what is more likely  provided him with so many instances of what a hand can do that he shrank  as his will not was  from the cardinal labour of composition  which is excision  and he put it with the other bones  thinking how there was a writer called thomas browne  a doctor of norwich  whose writing upon such subjects took his fancy amazingly ,2325,439,-2.599999999999999,-0.8876992312632536,-0.8842105263157893,-0.8876992312632536,-0.37617807789065844,-2.599999999999999,-0.9079448943061317,-0.8551724137931033,-0.9079448943061317,-0.32433725664610336,14.106272672409435,0.23184687487529979,0.2035857739773631,0.23184687487529979,0.06687130325370742,-1.7339833333333337,-0.9308857520454976,-0.9601429257020256,-0.9308857520454976,-0.4112313095581533,13.548,1.4175049370487267,1.411692809126095,1.4175049370487267,0.09780123251200777,0.0,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3108329231308982,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3290008949455372,-0.6463032795042065,-0.6781046469837341,-0.36058802516305094,-0.6781046469837341,-0.1291649087979308,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.8592}",0.8592,0.9647396281302453,0.4261688132655874,0.9647396281302453,0.012779569887286632,0.09630102040816327,-0.11881605542403587,-0.07254829474002841,-0.11881605542403587,-0.1717977197406969,0.5650767688729409,0.5201973796181257,0.4979733770611984,0.5201973796181257,-0.13135417397763113,70.60863328583457,1.5105623682607319,1.2569442902036234,1.5105623682607319,-0.5047431657763308,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,0.08163194911201668
62,62,1,"So, taking his lantern and seeing that the bones were in order, for though romantic, he was singularly methodical and detested nothing so much as a ball of string on the floor, let alone the skull of an ancestor, he returned to that curious, moody pacing down the galleries, looking for something among the pictures, which was interrupted at length by a veritable spasm of sobbing, at the sight of a Dutch snow scene by an unknown artist. Then it seemed to him that life was not worth living any more. Forgetting the bones of his ancestors and how life is founded on a grave, he stood there shaken with sobs, all for the desire of a woman in Russian trousers, with slanting eyes, a pouting mouth and pearls about her neck. She had gone. She had left him. He was never to see her again. And so he sobbed. And so he found his way back to his own rooms; and Mrs Grimsditch, seeing the light in the window, put the tankard from her lips and said Praise be to God, his Lordship was safe in his room again; for she had been thinking all this while that he was foully murdered.",so  taking his lantern and seeing that the bones were in order  for though romantic  he was singularly methodical and detested nothing so much as a ball of string on the floor  let alone the skull of an ancestor  he returned to that curious  moody pacing down the galleries  looking for something among the pictures  which was interrupted at length by a veritable spasm of sobbing  at the sight of a dutch snow scene by an unknown artist  then it seemed to him that life was not worth living any more  forgetting the bones of his ancestors and how life is founded on a grave  he stood there shaken with sobs  all for the desire of a woman in russian trousers  with slanting eyes  a pouting mouth and pearls about her neck  she had gone  she had left him  he was never to see her again  and so he sobbed  and so he found his way back to his own rooms  and mrs grimsditch  seeing the light in the window  put the tankard from her lips and said praise be to god  his lordship was safe in his room again  for she had been thinking all this while that he was foully murdered ,1070,203,-3.0500000000000007,-1.0032597644965078,-1.010526315789474,-1.0032597644965078,-0.6786693156597795,-3.0500000000000007,-1.0255433578627022,-0.9793103448275864,-1.0255433578627022,-0.609100896236378,15.839812661265,0.25681404506757416,0.22860472040976523,0.25681404506757416,0.16238504723397734,1.1791666666666667,0.33989258066512434,0.4496674880323921,0.33989258066512434,0.18341754739646388,11.081000000000003,1.015209826431921,1.0766619134922257,1.015209826431921,0.677964786827605,19.590933499529164,0.16340363396988603,0.4072271100900401,0.16340363396988603,0.08069910162111311,0.7389336403393347,0.23100122220413383,0.41226871431149936,0.23100122220413383,0.31936116421547817,"{'neg': 0.116, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.7932}",-0.7932,-1.5445862931724885,-0.8754972625940368,-1.5445862931724885,-0.8127310482658467,0.13034188034188035,0.10889627875787283,0.11207579973902383,0.10889627875787283,0.14908526426835847,0.40284829346965434,0.11498737793679548,0.21494480029128799,0.11498737793679548,0.08994623503258603,37.870349067390904,0.21710747010575981,0.31121332352902115,0.21710747010575981,-0.20396031147446042,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,-0.1343076494491732

64,64,1,"For though these are not matters on which a biographer can profitably enlarge it is plain enough to those who have done a reader's part in making up from bare hints dropped here and there the whole boundary and circumference of a living person; can hear in what we only whisper a living voice; can see, often when we say nothing about it, exactly what he looked like; know without a word to guide them precisely what he thought--and it is for readers such as these that we write--it is plain then to such a reader that Orlando was strangely compounded of many humours--of melancholy, of indolence, of passion, of love of solitude, to say nothing of all those contortions and subtleties of temper which were indicated on the first page, when he slashed at a dead nigger's head; cut it down; hung it chivalrously out of his reach again and then betook himself to the windowseat with a book. The taste for books was an early one. As a child he was sometimes found at midnight by a page still reading. They took his taper away, and he bred glow-worms to serve his purpose. They took the glow-worms away, and he almost burnt the house down with a tinder. To put it in a nutshell, leaving the novelist to smooth out the crumpled silk and all its implications, he was a nobleman afflicted with a love of literature. Many people of his time, still more of his rank, escaped the infection and were thus free to run or ride or make love at their own sweet will. But some were early infected by a germ said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel and to be blown out of Greece and Italy, which was of so deadly a nature that it would shake the hand as it was raised to strike, and cloud the eye as it sought its prey, and make the tongue stammer as it declared its love. It was the fatal nature of this disease to substitute a phantom for reality, so that Orlando, to whom fortune had given every gift--plate, linen, houses, men-servants, carpets, beds in profusion--had only to open a book for the whole vast accumulation to turn to mist. The nine acres of stone which were his house vanished; one hundred and fifty indoor servants disappeared; his eighty riding horses became invisible; it would take too long to count the carpets, sofas, trappings, china, plate, cruets, chafing dishes and other movables often of beaten gold, which evaporated like so much sea mist under the miasma. So it was, and Orlando would sit by himself, reading, a naked man.",for though these are not matters on which a biographer can profitably enlarge it is plain enough to those who have done a reader own part in making up from bare hints dropped here and there the whole boundary and circumference of a living person  can hear in what we only whisper a living voice  can see  often when we say nothing about it  exactly what he looked like  know without a word to guide them precisely what he thought  and it is for readers such as these that we write  it is plain then to such a reader that orlando was strangely compounded of many humours  of melancholy  of indolence  of passion  of love of solitude  to say nothing of all those contortions and subtleties of temper which were indicated on the first page  when he slashed at a dead nigger own head  cut it down  hung it chivalrously out of his reach again and then betook himself to the windowseat with a book  the taste for books was an early one  as a child he was sometimes found at midnight by a page still reading  they took his taper away  and he bred glow worms to serve his purpose  they took the glow worms away  and he almost burnt the house down with a tinder  to put it in a nutshell  leaving the novelist to smooth out the crumpled silk and all its implications  he was a nobleman afflicted with a love of literature  many people of his time  still more of his rank  escaped the infection and were thus free to run or ride or make love at their own sweet will  but some were early infected by a germ said to be bred of the pollen of the asphodel and to be blown out of greece and italy  which was of so deadly a nature that it would shake the hand as it was raised to strike  and cloud the eye as it sought its prey  and make the tongue stammer as it declared its love  it was the fatal nature of this disease to substitute a phantom for reality  so that orlando  to whom fortune had given every gift  plate  linen  houses  men servants  carpets  beds in profusion  had only to open a book for the whole vast accumulation to turn to mist  the nine acres of stone which were his house vanished  one hundred and fifty indoor servants disappeared  his eighty riding horses became invisible  it would take too long to count the carpets  sofas  trappings  china  plate  cruets  chafing dishes and other movables often of beaten gold  which evaporated like so much sea mist under the miasma  so it was  and orlando would sit by himself  reading  a naked man ,2443,447,-8.649999999999999,-2.4413464002881113,-2.582456140350877,-2.4413464002881113,-0.822456082665225,-4.65,-1.4436712282860629,-1.420689655172414,-1.4436712282860629,-0.4645007321503219,-14.035711415303915,-0.1734657863746264,-0.20256741367239464,-0.1734657863746264,-0.06534598972258919,2.308630952380951,0.8325890576251819,0.9962684223959173,0.8325890576251819,0.14417584504437808,11.730999999999998,1.1212057007330647,1.1649351531201195,1.1212057007330647,-0.015105540154039377,37.21003293241881,0.6955435861660545,1.0530141586963668,0.6955435861660545,0.024393290066205768,-0.48195222336746607,-0.5702440293516172,-0.268892648324996,-0.5702440293516172,-0.09459521469415545,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.4335}",0.4335,0.3182738542870029,0.09082673598802632,0.3182738542870029,-0.12620602320111413,0.1508829365079365,0.24630326128540203,0.22348232418305428,0.24630326128540203,-0.08208608473340963,0.9838025983990901,1.5660796987641143,1.2284947931872927,1.5660796987641143,0.15863455156831419,72.77478572848737,1.5961447545704326,1.3195192690841744,1.5961447545704326,-0.48172959241034513,-0.9986,-0.8051470076049547,-0.05961338599043866,-0.8051470076049547,0.08519340842633087
65,65,1,"The disease gained rapidly upon him now in his solitude. He would read often six hours into the night; and when they came to him for orders about the slaughtering of cattle or the harvesting of wheat, he would push away his folio and look as if he did not understand what was said to him. This was bad enough and wrung the hearts of Hall, the falconer, of Giles, the groom, of Mrs Grimsditch, the housekeeper, of Mr Dupper, the chaplain. A fine gentleman like that, they said, had no need of books. Let him leave books, they said, to the palsied or the dying. But worse was to come. For once the disease of reading has laid upon the system it weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which dwells in the inkpot and festers in the quill. The wretch takes to writing. And while this is bad enough in a poor man, whose only property is a chair and a table set beneath a leaky roof--for he has not much to lose, after all--the plight of a rich man, who has houses and cattle, maidservants, asses and linen, and yet writes books, is pitiable in the extreme. The flavour of it all goes out of him; he is riddled by hot irons; gnawed by vermin. He would give every penny he has (such is the malignity of the germ) to write one little book and become famous; yet all the gold in Peru will not buy him the treasure of a well-turned line. So he falls into consumption and sickness, blows his brains out, turns his face to the wall. It matters not in what attitude they find him.

66,66,1,"Happily, Orlando was of a strong constitution and the disease (for reasons presently to be given) never broke him down as it has broken many of his peers. But he was deeply smitten with it, as the sequel shows. For when he had read for an hour or so in Sir Thomas Browne, and the bark of the stag and the call of the night watchman showed that it was the dead of night and all safe asleep, he crossed the room, took a silver key from his pocket and unlocked the doors of a great inlaid cabinet which stood in the corner. Within were some fifty drawers of cedar wood and upon each was a paper neatly written in Orlando's hand. He paused, as if hesitating which to open. One was inscribed 'The Death of Ajax', another 'The Birth of Pyramus', another 'Iphigenia in Aulis', another 'The Death of Hippolytus', another 'Meleager', another 'The Return of Odysseus',--in fact there was scarcely a single drawer that lacked the name of some mythological personage at a crisis of his career. In each drawer lay a document of considerable size all written over in Orlando's hand. The truth was that Orlando had been afflicted thus for many years. Never had any boy begged apples as Orlando begged paper; nor sweetmeats as he begged ink. Stealing away from talk and games, he had hidden himself behind curtains, in priest's holes, or in the cupboard behind his mother's bedroom which had a great hole in the floor and smelt horribly of starling's dung, with an inkhorn in one hand, a pen in another, and on his knee a roll of paper. Thus had been written, before he was turned twenty-five, some forty-seven plays, histories, romances, poems; some in prose, some in verse; some in French, some in Italian; all romantic, and all long. One he had had printed by John Ball of the Feathers and Coronet opposite St Paul's Cross, Cheapside; but though the sight of it gave him extreme delight, he had never dared show it even to his mother, since to write, much more to publish, was, he knew, for a nobleman an inexpiable disgrace.",happily  orlando was of a strong constitution and the disease  for reasons presently to be given  never broke him down as it has broken many of his peers  but he was deeply smitten with it  as the sequel shows  for when he had read for an hour or so in sir thomas browne  and the bark of the stag and the call of the night watchman showed that it was the dead of night and all safe asleep  he crossed the room  took a silver key from his pocket and unlocked the doors of a great inlaid cabinet which stood in the corner  within were some fifty drawers of cedar wood and upon each was a paper neatly written in orlando own hand  he paused  as if hesitating which to open  one was inscribed  the death of ajax   another  the birth of pyramus   another  iphigenia in aulis   another  the death of hippolytus   another  meleager   another  the return of odysseus    in fact there was scarcely a single drawer that lacked the name of some mythological personage at a crisis of his career  in each drawer lay a document of considerable size all written over in orlando own hand  the truth was that orlando had been afflicted thus for many years  never had any boy begged apples as orlando begged paper  nor sweetmeats as he begged ink  stealing away from talk and games  he had hidden himself behind curtains  in priest own holes  or in the cupboard behind his mother own bedroom which had a great hole in the floor and smelt horribly of starling own dung  with an inkhorn in one hand  a pen in another  and on his knee a roll of paper  thus had been written  before he was turned twenty five  some forty seven plays  histories  romances  poems  some in prose  some in verse  some in french  some in italian  all romantic  and all long  one he had had printed by john ball of the feathers and coronet opposite st paul own cross  cheapside  but though the sight of it gave him extreme delight  he had never dared show it even to his mother  since to write  much more to publish  was  he knew  for a nobleman an inexpiable disgrace ,2012,363,-3.0,-0.9904197052483683,-0.9964912280701754,-0.9904197052483683,-0.45400729725354816,-2.0,-0.7511469428973717,-0.6896551724137931,-0.7511469428973717,-0.3114191558458991,-43.35953207530686,-0.5957997537550724,-0.6257772057754983,-0.5957997537550724,-0.24858218138401358,-1.09375,-0.6516022795572641,-0.6503038784324953,-0.6516022795572641,-0.35414856267661626,9.429000000000002,0.7458172351311652,0.852312079853331,0.7458172351311652,-0.021674763553855385,0.0,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3108329231308982,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3290008949455372,-0.9968609092084699,-0.9081692619874467,-0.5561724936464384,-0.9081692619874467,-0.24093541593761836,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.6824}",0.6824,0.6962520809949734,0.2868958997991256,0.6962520809949734,0.001900658806405229,0.16366713352007467,0.33182164560189037,0.292818727599526,0.33182164560189037,0.00394141296264954,0.9723032122640796,1.537356835755519,1.208432625411698,1.537356835755519,0.3102194149656676,63.30066773473784,1.2218323977301253,1.045834591266812,1.2218323977301253,-0.3463340473428805,-0.8049,-0.5820079326848077,0.047751680177371275,-0.5820079326848077,0.08655114369736266

68,68,1,"As this pause was of extreme significance in his history, more so, indeed, than many acts which bring men to their knees and make rivers run with blood, it behoves us to ask why he paused; and to reply, after due reflection, that it was for some such reason as this. Nature, who has played so many queer tricks upon us, making us so unequally of clay and diamonds, of rainbow and granite, and stuffed them into a case, often of the most incongruous, for the poet has a butcher's face and the butcher a poet's; nature, who delights in muddle and mystery, so that even now (the first of November     ) we know not why we go upstairs, or why we come down again, our most daily movements are like the passage of a ship on an unknown sea, and the sailors at the mast-head ask, pointing their glasses to the horizon; Is there land or is there none? to which, if we are prophets, we make answer 'Yes'; if we are truthful we say 'No'; nature, who has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence, has further complicated her task and added to our confusion by providing not only a perfect rag-bag of odds and ends within us--a piece of a policeman's trousers lying cheek by jowl with Queen Alexandra's wedding veil--but has contrived that the whole assortment shall be lightly stitched together by a single thread. Memory is the seamstress, and a capricious one at that. Memory runs her needle in and out, up and down, hither and thither. We know not what comes next, or what follows after. Thus, the most ordinary movement in the world, such as sitting down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one, may agitate a thousand odd, disconnected fragments, now bright, now dim, hanging and bobbing and dipping and flaunting, like the underlinen of a family of fourteen on a line in a gale of wind. Instead of being a single, downright, bluff piece of work of which no man need feel ashamed, our commonest deeds are set about with a fluttering and flickering of wings, a rising and falling of lights. Thus it was that Orlando, dipping his pen in the ink, saw the mocking face of the lost Princess and asked himself a million questions instantly which were as arrows dipped in gall. Where was she; and why had she left him? Was the Ambassador her uncle or her lover? Had they plotted? Was she forced? Was she married? Was she dead?--all of which so drove their venom into him that, as if to vent his agony somewhere, he plunged his quill so deep into the inkhorn that the ink spirted over the table, which act, explain it how one may (and no explanation perhaps is possible--Memory is inexplicable), at once substituted for the face of the Princess a face of a very different sort. But whose was it, he asked himself? And he had to wait, perhaps half a minute, looking at the new picture which lay on top of the old, as one lantern slide is half seen through the next, before he could say to himself, 'This is the face of that rather fat, shabby man who sat in Twitchett's room ever so many years ago when old Queen Bess came here to dine; and I saw him,' Orlando continued, catching at another of those little coloured rags, 'sitting at the table, as I peeped in on my way downstairs, and he had the most amazing eyes,' said Orlando, 'that ever were, but who the devil was he?' Orlando asked, for here Memory added to the forehead and eyes, first, a coarse, grease-stained ruffle, then a brown doublet, and finally a pair of thick boots such as citizens wear in Cheapside. 'Not a Nobleman; not one of us,' said Orlando (which he would not have said aloud, for he was the most courteous of gentlemen; but it shows what an effect noble birth has upon the mind and incidentally how difficult it is for a nobleman to be a writer), 'a poet, I dare say.' By all the laws, Memory, having disturbed him sufficiently, should now have blotted the whole thing out completely, or have fetched up something so idiotic and out of keeping--like a dog chasing a cat or an old woman blowing her nose into a red cotton handkerchief--that, in despair of keeping pace with her vagaries, Orlando should have struck his pen in earnest against his paper. (For we can, if we have the resolution, turn the hussy, Memory, and all her ragtag and bobtail out of the house.) But Orlando paused. Memory still held before him the image of a shabby man with big, bright eyes. Still he looked, still he paused. It is these pauses that are our undoing. It is then that sedition enters the fortress and our troops rise in insurrection. Once before he had paused, and love with its horrid rout, its shawms, its cymbals, and its heads with gory locks torn from the shoulders had burst in. From love he had suffered the tortures of the damned. Now, again, he paused, and into the breach thus made, leapt Ambition, the harridan, and Poetry, the witch, and Desire of Fame, the strumpet; all joined hands and made of his heart their dancing ground. Standing upright in the solitude of his room, he vowed that he would be the first poet of his race and bring immortal lustre upon his name. He said (reciting the names and exploits of his ancestors) that Sir Boris had fought and killed the Paynim; Sir Gawain, the Turk; Sir Miles, the Pole; Sir Andrew, the Frank; Sir Richard, the Austrian; Sir Jordan, the Frenchman; and Sir Herbert, the Spaniard. But of all that killing and campaigning, that drinking and love-making, that spending and hunting and riding and eating, what remained? A skull; a finger. Whereas, he said, turning to the page of Sir Thomas Browne, which lay open upon the table--and again he paused. Like an incantation rising from all parts of the room, from the night wind and the moonlight, rolled the divine melody of those words which, lest they should outstare this page, we will leave where they lie entombed, not dead, embalmed rather, so fresh is their colour, so sound their breathing--and Orlando, comparing that achievement with those of his ancestors, cried out that they and their deeds were dust and ashes, but this man and his words were immortal.",as this pause was of extreme significance in his history  more so  indeed  than many acts which bring men to their knees and make rivers run with blood  it behoves us to ask why he paused  and to reply  after due reflection  that it was for some such reason as this  nature  who has played so many queer tricks upon us  making us so unequally of clay and diamonds  of rainbow and granite  and stuffed them into a case  often of the most incongruous  for the poet has a butcher own face and the butcher a poet own  nature  who delights in muddle and mystery  so that even now  the first of november       we know not why we go upstairs  or why we come down again  our most daily movements are like the passage of a ship on an unknown sea  and the sailors at the mast head ask  pointing their glasses to the horizon  is there land or is there none  to which  if we are prophets  we make answer  yes   if we are truthful we say  no   nature  who has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence  has further complicated her task and added to our confusion by providing not only a perfect rag bag of odds and ends within us  a piece of a policeman own trousers lying cheek by jowl with queen alexandra own wedding veil  but has contrived that the whole assortment shall be lightly stitched together by a single thread  memory is the seamstress  and a capricious one at that  memory runs her needle in and out  up and down  hither and thither  we know not what comes next  or what follows after  thus  the most ordinary movement in the world  such as sitting down at a table and pulling the inkstand towards one  may agitate a thousand odd  disconnected fragments  now bright  now dim  hanging and bobbing and dipping and flaunting  like the underlinen of a family of fourteen on a line in a gale of wind  instead of being a single  downright  bluff piece of work of which no man need feel ashamed  our commonest deeds are set about with a fluttering and flickering of wings  a rising and falling of lights  thus it was that orlando  dipping his pen in the ink  saw the mocking face of the lost princess and asked himself a million questions instantly which were as arrows dipped in gall  where was she  and why had she left him  was the ambassador her uncle or her lover  had they plotted  was she forced  was she married  was she dead   all of which so drove their venom into him that  as if to vent his agony somewhere  he plunged his quill so deep into the inkhorn that the ink spirted over the table  which act  explain it how one may  and no explanation perhaps is possible  memory is inexplicable   at once substituted for the face of the princess a face of a very different sort  but whose was it  he asked himself  and he had to wait  perhaps half a minute  looking at the new picture which lay on top of the old  as one lantern slide is half seen through the next  before he could say to himself   this is the face of that rather fat  shabby man who sat in twitchett own room ever so many years ago when old queen bess came here to dine  and i saw him   orlando continued  catching at another of those little coloured rags   ownitting at the table  as i peeped in on my way downstairs  and he had the most amazing eyes   said orlando   that ever were  but who the devil was he   orlando asked  for here memory added to the forehead and eyes  first  a coarse  grease stained ruffle  then a brown doublet  and finally a pair of thick boots such as citizens wear in cheapside   not a nobleman  not one of us   said orlando  which he would not have said aloud  for he was the most courteous of gentlemen  but it shows what an effect noble birth has upon the mind and incidentally how difficult it is for a nobleman to be a writer    a poet  i dare say   by all the laws  memory  having disturbed him sufficiently  should now have blotted the whole thing out completely  or have fetched up something so idiotic and out of keeping  like a dog chasing a cat or an old woman blowing her nose into a red cotton handkerchief  that  in despair of keeping pace with her vagaries  orlando should have struck his pen in earnest against his paper   for we can  if we have the resolution  turn the hussy  memory  and all her ragtag and bobtail out of the house   but orlando paused  memory still held before him the image of a shabby man with big  bright eyes  still he looked  still he paused  it is these pauses that are our undoing  it is then that sedition enters the fortress and our troops rise in insurrection  once before he had paused  and love with its horrid rout  its shawms  its cymbals  and its heads with gory locks torn from the shoulders had burst in  from love he

70,70,1,"It was to settle this last question that he decided after many months of such feverish labour, to break the solitude of years and communicate with the outer world. He had a friend in London, one Giles Isham, of Norfolk, who, though of gentle birth, was acquainted with writers and could doubtless put him in touch with some member of that blessed, indeed sacred, fraternity. For, to Orlando in the state he was now in, there was a glory about a man who had written a book and had it printed, which outshone all the glories of blood and state. To his imagination it seemed as if even the bodies of those instinct with such divine thoughts must be transfigured. They must have aureoles for hair, incense for breath, and roses must grow between their lips--which was certainly not true either of himself or Mr Dupper. He could think of no greater happiness than to be allowed to sit behind a curtain and hear them talk. Even the imagination of that bold and various discourse made the memory of what he and his courtier friends used to talk about--a dog, a horse, a woman, a game of cards--seem brutish in the extreme. He bethought him with pride that he had always been called a scholar, and sneered at for his love of solitude and books. He had never been apt at pretty phrases. He would stand stock still, blush, and stride like a grenadier in a ladies' drawing-room. He had twice fallen, in sheer abstraction, from his horse. He had broken Lady Winchilsea's fan once while making a rhyme. Eagerly recalling these and other instances of his unfitness for the life of society, an ineffable hope, that all the turbulence of his youth, his clumsiness, his blushes, his long walks, and his love of the country proved that he himself belonged to the sacred race rather than to the noble--was by birth a writer, rather than an aristocrat--possessed him. For the first time since the night of the great flood he was happy.",it was to settle this last question that he decided after many months of such feverish labour  to break the solitude of years and communicate with the outer world  he had a friend in london  one giles isham  of norfolk  who  though of gentle birth  was acquainted with writers and could doubtless put him in touch with some member of that blessed  indeed sacred  fraternity  for  to orlando in the state he was now in  there was a glory about a man who had written a book and had it printed  which outshone all the glories of blood and state  to his imagination it seemed as if even the bodies of those instinct with such divine thoughts must be transfigured  they must have aureoles for hair  incense for breath  and roses must grow between their lips  which was certainly not true either of himself or mr dupper  he could think of no greater happiness than to be allowed to sit behind a curtain and hear them talk  even the imagination of that bold and various discourse made the memory of what he and his courtier friends used to talk about  a dog  a horse  a woman  a game of cards  seem brutish in the extreme  he bethought him with pride that he had always been called a scholar  and sneered at for his love of solitude and books  he had never been apt at pretty phrases  he would stand stock still  blush  and stride like a grenadier in a ladies  drawing room  he had twice fallen  in sheer abstraction  from his horse  he had broken lady winchilsea own fan once while making a rhyme  eagerly recalling these and other instances of his unfitness for the life of society  an ineffable hope  that all the turbulence of his youth  his clumsiness  his blushes  his long walks  and his love of the country proved that he himself belonged to the sacred race rather than to the noble  was by birth a writer  rather than an aristocrat  possessed him  for the first time since the night of the great flood he was happy ,1915,343,14.850000000000001,3.5934814463373708,4.014035087719298,3.5934814463373708,1.2594608101533236,15.350000000000001,3.7829271520059455,4.096551724137932,3.7829271520059455,1.2610502493170022,131.23487495815175,1.9187821440074142,1.8940193637001541,1.9187821440074142,0.7962458370859339,6.46577380952381,2.646023679542994,3.0081055373339236,2.646023679542994,0.978144197372412,22.484999999999992,2.874866673401541,2.62538195151762,2.874866673401541,0.9461643214227443,126.11984049349753,3.380837515378157,4.311796052499935,3.380837515378157,1.2319748704502191,4.86745977976892,2.9404780565891766,2.7156719843567343,2.9404780565891766,1.2450332611190804,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958,1.1721796673761624,0.5337744692583403,1.1721796673761624,0.14594531842340835,0.18244047619047618,0.4574037163309466,0.3946378766344417,0.4574037163309466,0.06544600173375589,1.1243514324252422,1.917138864736479,1.4737004290178954,1.917138864736479,0.5004766493870368,61.93422961154246,1.1678458762716475,1.0063614521576292,1.1678458762716475,-0.27399448784498476,-0.995,-0.8009998694030315,-0.05761795884431516,-0.8009998694030315,0.030810107816279624

73,73,1,"That Orlando as he hastened to greet him was slightly disappointed was inevitable. The poet was not above middle height; was of a mean figure; was lean and stooped somewhat, and, stumbling over the mastiff on entering, the dog bit him. Moreover, Orlando for all his knowledge of mankind was puzzled where to place him. There was something about him which belonged neither to servant, squire, or noble. The head with its rounded forehead and beaked nose was fine, but the chin receded. The eyes were brilliant, but the lips hung loose and slobbered. It was the expression of the face--as a whole, however, that was disquieting. There was none of that stately composure which makes the faces of the nobility so pleasing to look at; nor had it anything of the dignified servility of a well-trained domestic's face; it was a face seamed, puckered, and drawn together. Poet though he was, it seemed as if he were more used to scold than to flatter; to quarrel than to coo; to scramble than to ride; to struggle than to rest; to hate than to love. This, too, was shown by the quickness of his movements; and by something fiery and suspicious in his glance. Orlando was somewhat taken aback.

74,74,1,"Here, Orlando, who usually took such things for granted, was, for the first time, unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of the splendour of his table. Stranger still, he bethought him with pride--for the thought was generally distasteful--of that great grandmother Moll who had milked the cows. He was about somehow to allude to this humble woman and her milk-pails, when the poet forestalled him by saying that it was odd, seeing how common the name of Greene was, that the family had come over with the Conqueror and was of the highest nobility in France. Unfortunately, they had come down in the world and done little more than leave their name to the royal borough of Greenwich. Further talk of the same sort, about lost castles, coats of arms, cousins who were baronets in the north, intermarriage with noble families in the west, how some Greens spelt the name with an e at the end, and others without, lasted till the venison was on the table. Then Orlando contrived to say something of Grandmother Moll and her cows, and had eased his heart a little of its burden by the time the wild fowl were before them. But it was not until the Malmsey was passing freely that Orlando dared mention what he could not help thinking a more important matter than the Greens or the cows; that is to say the sacred subject of poetry. At the first mention of the word, the poet's eyes flashed fire; he dropped the fine gentleman airs he had worn; thumped his glass on the table, and launched into one of the longest, most intricate, most passionate, and bitterest stories that Orlando had ever heard, save from the lips of a jilted woman, about a play of his; another poet; and a critic. Of the nature of poetry itself, Orlando only gathered that it was harder to sell than prose, and though the lines were shorter took longer in the writing. So the talk went on with ramifications interminable, until Orlando ventured to hint that he had himself been so rash as to write--but here the poet leapt from his chair. A mouse had squeaked in the wainscot, he said. The truth was, he explained, that his nerves were in a state where a mouse's squeak upset them for a fortnight. Doubtless the house was full of vermin, but Orlando had not heard them. The poet then gave Orlando the full story of his health for the past ten years or so. It had been so bad that one could only marvel that he still lived. He had had the palsy, the gout, the ague, the dropsy, and the three sorts of fever in succession; added to which he had an enlarged heart, a great spleen, and a diseased liver. But, above all, he had, he told Orlando, sensations in his spine which defied description. There was one knob about the third from the top which burnt like fire; another about second from the bottom which was cold as ice. Sometimes he woke with a brain like lead; at others it was as if a thousand wax tapers were alight and people were throwing fireworks inside him. He could feel a rose leaf through his mattress, he said; and knew his way almost about London by the feel of the cobbles. Altogether he was a piece of machinery so finely made and curiously put together (here he raised his hand as if unconsciously, and indeed it was of the finest shape imaginable) that it confounded him to think that he had only sold five hundred copies of his poem, but that of course was largely due to the conspiracy against him. All he could say, he concluded, banging his fist upon the table, was that the art of poetry was dead in England.",here  orlando  who usually took such things for granted  was  for the first time  unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of the splendour of his table  stranger still  he bethought him with pride  for the thought was generally distasteful  of that great grandmother moll who had milked the cows  he was about somehow to allude to this humble woman and her milk pails  when the poet forestalled him by saying that it was odd  seeing how common the name of greene was  that the family had come over with the conqueror and was of the highest nobility in france  unfortunately  they had come down in the world and done little more than leave their name to the royal borough of greenwich  further talk of the same sort  about lost castles  coats of arms  cousins who were baronets in the north  intermarriage with noble families in the west  how some greens spelt the name with an e at the end  and others without  lasted till the venison was on the table  then orlando contrived to say something of grandmother moll and her cows  and had eased his heart a little of its burden by the time the wild fowl were before them  but it was not until the malmsey was passing freely that orlando dared mention what he could not help thinking a more important matter than the greens or the cows  that is to say the sacred subject of poetry  at the first mention of the word  the poet own eyes flashed fire  he dropped the fine gentleman airs he had worn  thumped his glass on the table  and launched into one of the longest  most intricate  most passionate  and bitterest stories that orlando had ever heard  save from the lips of a jilted woman  about a play of his  another poet  and a critic  of the nature of poetry itself  orlando only gathered that it was harder to sell than prose  and though the lines were shorter took longer in the writing  so the talk went on with ramifications interminable  until orlando ventured to hint that he had himself been so rash as to write  but here the poet leapt from his chair  a mouse had squeaked in the wainscot  he said  the truth was  he explained  that his nerves were in a state where a mouse own squeak upset them for a fortnight  doubtless the house was full of vermin  but orlando had not heard them  the poet then gave orlando the full story of his health for the past ten years or so  it had been so bad that one could only marvel that he still lived  he had had the palsy  the gout  the ague  the dropsy  and the three sorts of fever in succession  added to which he had an enlarged heart  a great spleen  and a diseased liver  but  above all  he had  he told orlando  sensations in his spine which defied description  there was one knob about the third from the top which burnt like fire  another about second from the bottom which was cold as ice  sometimes he woke with a brain like lead  at others it was as if a thousand wax tapers were alight and people were throwing fireworks inside him  he could feel a rose leaf through his mattress  he said  and knew his way almost about london by the feel of the cobbles  altogether he was a piece of machinery so finely made and curiously put together  here he raised his hand as if unconsciously  and indeed it was of the finest shape imaginable  that it confounded him to think that he had only sold five hundred copies of his poem  but that of course was largely due to the conspiracy against him  all he could say  he concluded  banging his fist upon the table  was that the art of poetry was dead in england ,3514,644,-0.7000000000000004,-0.39977697983395954,-0.3508771929824563,-0.39977697983395954,-0.21547578239137022,-0.7000000000000004,-0.4114180481783912,-0.3310344827586208,-0.4114180481783912,-0.17305297187016722,-26.748794872194026,-0.35656494784612397,-0.3860462812170487,-0.35656494784612397,-0.0864391297739402,2.888940476190477,1.0857324828256572,1.2771075174840285,1.0857324828256572,0.10281296818538875,20.111000000000004,2.487737126338593,2.302980919399743,2.487737126338593,0.1067808822671762,12.138152300992546,-0.061688610149843184,0.1340627754176671,-0.061688610149843184,-0.2489854945382365,-0.15204564423023306,-0.3537323243277391,-0.0848298938382019,-0.3537323243277391,-0.0207138495704118,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.85}",0.85,0.95076855667298,0.41892158021190284,0.95076855667298,-0.07692830179029954,0.07188888888888889,-0.28211814184117845,-0.20494999331126112,-0.28211814184117845,-0.2535802220429,0.5948430088595679,0.5945467077804222,0.5499044361324468,0.5945467077804222,-0.2467268502290896,99.2858056823422,2.6435670441930332,2.0853594200583627,2.6435670441930332,-0.5827552833021458,-0.994,-0.799847886569164,-0.05706367352594754,-0.799847886569164,0.14150586146768185

In such ages men cherished a divine ambition which he might call La Gloire (he pronounced it Glawr, so that Orlando did not at first catch his meaning). Now all young writers were in the pay of the booksellers and poured out any trash that would sell. Shakespeare was the chief offender in this way and Shakespeare was already paying the penalty. Their own age, he said, was marked by precious conceits and wild experiments--neither of which the Greeks would have tolerated for a moment.

On the contrary, the more he denounced his own time, the more complacent he became. He could remember, he said, a night at the Cock Tavern in Fleet Street when Kit Marlowe was there and some others. Kit was in high feather, rather drunk, which he easily became, and in a mood to say silly things. He could see him now, brandishing his glass at the company and hiccoughing out, 'Stap my vitals, Bill' (this was to Shakespeare), 'there's a great wave coming and you're on the top of it,' by which he meant, Greene explained, that they were trembling on the verge of a great age in English literature, and that Shakespeare was to be a poet of some importance. Happily for himself, he was killed two nights later in a drunken brawl, and so did not live to see how this prediction turned out.

(Orlando could have wished him a better accent.) 'Glawr', said Greene, 'is the spur of noble minds. Had I a pension of three hundred pounds a year paid quarterly, I would live for Glawr alone.

80,80,1,"By this time Orlando had abandoned all hope of discussing his own work with the poet; but this mattered the less as the talk now got upon the lives and characters of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the rest, all of whom Greene had known intimately and about whom he had a thousand anecdotes of the most amusing kind to tell. Orlando had never laughed so much in his life. These, then, were his gods! Half were drunken and all were amorous. Most of them quarrelled with their wives; not one of them was above a lie or an intrigue of the most paltry kind. Their poetry was scribbled down on the backs of washing bills held to the heads of printer's devils at the street door. Thus Hamlet went to press; thus Lear; thus Othello. No wonder, as Greene said, that these plays show the faults they do. The rest of the time was spent in carousings and junketings in taverns and in beer gardens, When things were said that passed belief for wit, and things were done that made the utmost frolic of the courtiers seem pale in comparison. All this Greene told with a spirit that roused Orlando to the highest pitch of delight.

81,81,1,"So time passed, and Orlando felt for his guest a strange mixture of liking and contempt, of admiration and pity, as well as something too indefinite to be called by any one name, but had something of fear in it and something of fascination. He talked incessantly about himself, yet was such good company that one could listen to the story of his ague for ever. Then he was so witty; then he was so irreverent; then he made so free with the names of God and Woman; then he was So full of queer crafts and had such strange lore in his head; could make salad in three hundred different ways; knew all that could be known of the mixing of wines; played half-a-dozen musical instruments, and was the first person, and perhaps the last, to toast cheese in the great Italian fireplace. That he did not know a geranium from a carnation, an oak from a birch tree, a mastiff from a greyhound, a teg from a ewe, wheat from barley, plough land from fallow; was ignorant of the rotation of the crops; thought oranges grew underground and turnips on trees; preferred any townscape to any landscape;--all this and much more amazed Orlando, who had never met anybody of his kind before. Even the maids, who despised him, tittered at his jokes, and the men-servants, who loathed him, hung about to hear his stories. Indeed, the house had never been so lively as now that he was there--all of which gave Orlando a great deal to think about, and caused him to compare this way of life with the old. He recalled the sort of talk he had been used to about the King of Spain's apoplexy or the mating of a bitch; he bethought him how the day passed between the stables and the dressing closet; he remembered how the Lords snored over their wine and hated anybody who woke them up. He bethought him how active and valiant they were in body; how slothful and timid in mind. Worried by these thoughts, and unable to strike a proper balance, he came to the conclusion that he had admitted to his house a plaguey spirit of unrest that would never suffer him to sleep sound again.",so time passed  and orlando felt for his guest a strange mixture of liking and contempt  of admiration and pity  as well as something too indefinite to be called by any one name  but had something of fear in it and something of fascination  he talked incessantly about himself  yet was such good company that one could listen to the story of his ague for ever  then he was so witty  then he was so irreverent  then he made so free with the names of god and woman  then he was so full of queer crafts and had such strange lore in his head  could make salad in three hundred different ways  knew all that could be known of the mixing of wines  played half a dozen musical instruments  and was the first person  and perhaps the last  to toast cheese in the great italian fireplace  that he did not know a geranium from a carnation  an oak from a birch tree  a mastiff from a greyhound  a teg from a ewe  wheat from barley  plough land from fallow  was ignorant of the rotation of the crops  thought oranges grew underground and turnips on trees  preferred any townscape to any landscape   all this and much more amazed orlando  who had never met anybody of his kind before  even the maids  who despised him  tittered at his jokes  and the men servants  who loathed him  hung about to hear his stories  indeed  the house had never been so lively as now that he was there  all of which gave orlando a great deal to think about  and caused him to compare this way of life with the old  he recalled the sort of talk he had been used to about the king of spain own apoplexy or the mating of a bitch  he bethought him how the day passed between the stables and the dressing closet  he remembered how the lords snored over their wine and hated anybody who woke them up  he bethought him how active and valiant they were in body  how slothful and timid in mind  worried by these thoughts  and unable to strike a proper balance  he came to the conclusion that he had admitted to his house a plaguey spirit of unrest that would never suffer him to sleep sound again ,2051,379,-3.7,-1.1701805347223189,-1.1929824561403508,-1.1701805347223189,-0.5037929655703066,-2.6999999999999997,-0.9340778862075919,-0.882758620689655,-0.9340778862075919,-0.3619255826293656,-86.29066626235907,-1.2141119592341738,-1.2453716503300842,-1.2141119592341738,-0.4738235533517791,3.519141666666668,1.3606397200450187,1.58209153858873,1.3606397200450187,0.3952702000450973,9.461999999999996,0.7511985641341454,0.8567936443267464,0.7511985641341454,-0.04636076888731003,56.41486067385805,1.2755764167424035,1.7569223847312152,1.2755764167424035,0.30291776193399966,-0.9912041642228069,-0.9044568428385649,-0.5530164606075901,-0.9044568428385649,-0.22945451627352095,"{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9805}",0.9805,1.1489451681048408,0.5217220055929734,1.1489451681048408,0.10144526706565182,0.15690235690235685,0.2865694669895061,0.2561292679374874,0.2865694669895061,-0.024056755902761497,0.7439514686337194,0.9669858809008303,0.8100434471742566,0.9669858809008303,0.08310943109336462,64.09786928640818,1.253328985790285,1.068863843168503,1.253328985790285,-0.40784274736756354,0.5986,1.0347999746483176,0.8256911245063396,1.0347999746483176,0.3961783583403057

83,83,1,"So he sought Orlando in his room, and explained that he had not been able to sleep a wink all night because of the silence. (Indeed, the house was surrounded by a park fifteen miles in circumference and a wall ten feet high.) Silence, he said, was of all things the most oppressive to his nerves. He would end his visit, by Orlando's leave, that very morning. Orlando felt some relief at this, yet also a great reluctance to let him go. The house, he thought, would seem very dull without him. On parting (for he had never yet liked to mention the subject), he had the temerity to press his play upon the Death of Hercules upon the poet and ask his opinion of it. The poet took it; muttered something about Glawr and Cicero, which Orlando cut short by promising to pay the pension quarterly; whereupon Greene, with many protestations of affection, jumped into the coach and was gone.",so he sought orlando in his room  and explained that he had not been able to sleep a wink all night because of the silence   indeed  the house was surrounded by a park fifteen miles in circumference and a wall ten feet high   silence  he said  was of all things the most oppressive to his nerves  he would end his visit  by orlando own leave  that very morning  orlando felt some relief at this  yet also a great reluctance to let him go  the house  he thought  would seem very dull without him  on parting  for he had never yet liked to mention the subject   he had the temerity to press his play upon the death of hercules upon the poet and ask his opinion of it  the poet took it  muttered something about glawr and cicero  which orlando cut short by promising to pay the pension quarterly  whereupon greene  with many protestations of affection  jumped into the coach and was gone ,883,161,-0.6499999999999999,-0.3869369205858201,-0.3368421052631579,-0.3869369205858201,-0.31352404855767574,-0.6499999999999999,-0.3983515522276611,-0.3172413793103448,-0.3983515522276611,-0.2653550872469563,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,-2.5425595238095227,-1.2836039791202578,-1.3514510058321374,-1.2836039791202578,-1.1328648435829765,9.424,0.7450018822519251,0.8516330549331161,0.7450018822519251,0.7745061572673684,0.0,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3108329231308982,-0.42829053607703205,-0.3290008949455372,-0.3855350090400602,-0.5069671601170826,-0.215099183231159,-0.5069671601170826,-0.21009254745346334,"{'neg': 0.115, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.2542}",-0.2542,-0.7260637371435769,-0.45090393477490254,-0.7260637371435769,-0.4849646169583927,0.27032051282051284,1.0452668992229937,0.8712642667197289,1.0452668992229937,0.936222170342383,0.7457763260678744,0.971543961608449,0.8132271472066518,0.971543961608449,0.9302528201737311,31.421103236764907,-0.03769539474105549,0.12490998970055019,-0.03769539474105549,-0.10326136263933403,-0.9993,-0.8059533955886619,-0.060001385713295954,-0.8059533955886619,-0.23879093268949858

85,85,1,"Nick Greene was set down at the corner of Fetter Lane that same afternoon, and found things going on much as he had left them. Mrs Greene, that is to say, was giving birth to a baby in one room; Tom Fletcher was drinking gin in another. Books were tumbled all about the floor; dinner--such as it was--was set on a dressing-table where the children had been making mud pies. But this, Greene felt, was the atmosphere for writing, here he could write, and write he did. The subject was made for him. A noble Lord at home. A visit to a Nobleman in the country--his new poem was to have some such title as that. Seizing the pen with which his little boy was tickling the cat's ears, and dipping it in the egg-cup which served for inkpot, Greene dashed off a very spirited satire there and then. It was so done to a turn that no one could doubt that the young Lord who was roasted was Orlando; his most private sayings and doings, his enthusiasms and folies, down to the very colour of his hair and the foreign way he had of rolling his r's, were there to the life. And if there had been any doubt about it, Greene clinched the matter by introducing, with scarcely any disguise, passages from that aristocratic tragedy, the Death of Hercules, which he found as he expected, wordy and bombastic in the extreme.",nick greene was set down at the corner of fetter lane that same afternoon  and found things going on much as he had left them  mrs greene  that is to say  was giving birth to a baby in one room  tom fletcher was drinking gin in another  books were tumbled all about the floor  dinner  such as it was  was set on a dressing table where the children had been making mud pies  but this  greene felt  was the atmosphere for writing  here he could write  and write he did  the subject was made for him  a noble lord at home  a visit to a nobleman in the country  his new poem was to have some such title as that  seizing the pen with which his little boy was tickling the cat own ears  and dipping it in the egg cup which served for inkpot  greene dashed off a very spirited satire there and then  it was so done to a turn that no one could doubt that the young lord who was roasted was orlando  his most private sayings and doings  his enthusiasms and folies  down to the very colour of his hair and the foreign way he had of rolling his r own  were there to the life  and if there had been any doubt about it  greene clinched the matter by introducing  with scarcely any disguise  passages from that aristocratic tragedy  the death of hercules  which he found as he expected  wordy and bombastic in the extreme ,1304,243,2.2,0.34494645655812134,0.46315789473684216,0.34494645655812134,0.12152398711114303,3.2,0.6077686359785504,0.7448275862068966,0.6077686359785504,0.2729439724531572,-92.00392481945315,-1.2963967058592605,-1.3278270368301468,-1.2963967058592605,-0.7879381235424476,-0.5958333333333329,-0.4344003807551092,-0.4093385653389038,-0.4344003807551092,-0.3199574907204824,12.996000000000002,1.3274899791806778,1.3367284579344068,1.3274899791806778,0.6509503663251369,6.442692510014894,-0.23370544406636415,-0.07469103648293579,-0.23370544406636415,-0.21644506400461752,-0.533669102006468,-0.6041848789155341,-0.29774672926102425,-0.6041848789155341,-0.19268082079845833,"{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': -0.8908}",-0.8908,-1.69280113819739,-0.9523809523809524,-1.69280113819739,-0.7787305002428099,0.12243265993265995,0.05598847782541541,0.06917933181985673,0.05598847782541541,0.04414686051414416,0.4738505609109202,0.29233496650120566,0.33881744750307896,0.29233496650120566,0.07900566779969508,44.472425167205664,0.4779484968473631,0.5019315594107769,0.4779484968473631,-0.2453613528975025,-0.6144,-0.36255520283303677,0.15334303332640475,-0.36255520283303677,0.061185838821992466

Love and ambition, women and poets were all equally vain. Literature was a farce. The night after reading Greene's Visit to a Nobleman in the Country, he burnt in a great conflagration fifty-seven poetical works, only retaining 'The Oak Tree', which was his boyish dream and very short. Two things alone remained to him in which he now put any trust: dogs and nature; an elk-hound and a rose bush. The world, in all its variety, life in all its complexity, had shrunk to that. Dogs and a bush were the whole of it. So feeling quit of a vast mountain of illusion, and very naked in consequence, he called his hounds to him and strode through the Park.",thus  at the age of thirty  or thereabouts  this young nobleman had not only had every experience that life has to offer  but had seen the worthlessness of them all  love and ambition  women and poets were all equally vain  literature was a farce  the night after reading greene own visit to a nobleman in the country  he burnt in a great conflagration fifty seven poetical works  only retaining  the oak tree   which was his boyish dream and very short  two things alone remained to him in which he now put any trust  dogs and nature  an elk hound and a rose bush  the world  in all its variety  life in all its complexity  had shrunk to that  dogs and a bush were the whole of it  so feeling quit of a vast mountain of illusion  and very naked in consequence  he called his hounds to him and strode through the park ,816,149,0.8000000000000003,-0.014575202389779681,0.0701754385964913,-0.014575202389779681,-0.0009194387317929281,0.8000000000000003,-0.019423169656490488,0.08275862068965524,-0.019423169656490488,0.02892922691443499,16.600594858071872,0.2677711494372687,0.23958454732521012,0.2677711494372687,0.2318619132767933,1.647916666666667,0.5443713556880735,0.6765176781832627,0.5443713556880735,0.5034020187452447,4.665000000000001,-0.031050988208301936,0.20533713587288674,-0.031050988208301936,0.10874850905719768,26.624279888606868,0.3758279196445751,0.6650180388335265,0.3758279196445751,0.42957400687037034,1.3661520739058644,0.6426333055322018,0.7622088484217815,0.6426333055322018,0.8044248525281189,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9207}",0.9207,1.0581332036326165,0.474614990744023,1.0581332036326165,0.6070814434351036,0.18461538461538465,0.47195251078067973,0.4064337154970748,0.47195251078067973,0.6022323332751642,0.5562309213348742,0.4981024552414882,0.4825406508841273,0.4981024552414882,0.6449143338721142,30.250510207915564,-0.0839442841699721,0.09109434837465093,-0.0839442841699721,-0.011303404811601983,-0.9998,-0.8065293870055958,-0.0602785283724798,-0.8065293870055958,-0.27982976132816684

93,93,1,"But Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect upon the mind of man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second. This extraordinary discrepancy between time on the clock and time in the mind is less known than it should be and deserves fuller investigation. But the biographer, whose interests are, as we have said, highly restricted, must confine himself to one simple statement: when a man has reached the age of thirty, as Orlando now had, time when he is thinking becomes inordinately long; time when he is doing becomes inordinately short. Thus Orlando gave his orders and did the business of his vast estates in a flash; but directly he was alone on the mound under the oak tree, the seconds began to round and fill until it seemed as if they would never fall. They filled themselves, moreover, with the strangest variety of objects. For not only did he find himself confronted by problems which have puzzled the wisest of men, such as What is love?

94,94,1,"In such thinking (or by whatever name it should be called) he spent months and years of his life. It would be no exaggeration to say that he would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come home to dinner a man of fifty-five at least. Some weeks added a century to his age, others no more than three seconds at most. Altogether, the task of estimating the length of human life (of the animals' we presume not to speak) is beyond our capacity, for directly we say that it is ages long, we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground. Of the two forces which alternately, and what is more confusing still, at the same moment, dominate our unfortunate numbskulls--brevity and diuturnity--Orlando was sometimes under the influence of the elephant-footed deity, then of the gnat-winged fly. Life seemed to him of prodigious length. Yet even so, it went like a flash. But even when it stretched longest and the moments swelled biggest and he seemed to wander alone in deserts of vast eternity, there was no time for the smoothing out and deciphering of those scored parchments which thirty years among men and women had rolled tight in his heart and brain. Long before he had done thinking about Love (the oak tree had put forth its leaves and shaken them to the ground a dozen times in the process) Ambition would jostle it off the field, to be replaced by Friendship or Literature. And as the first question had not been settled--What is Love?--back it would come at the least provocation or none, and hustle Books or Metaphors of What one lives for into the margin, there to wait till they saw their chance to rush into the field again. What made the process still longer was that it was profusely illustrated, not only with pictures, as that of old Queen Elizabeth, laid on her tapestry couch in rose-coloured brocade with an ivory snuff-box in her hand and a gold-hilted sword by her side, but with scents--she was strongly perfumed--and with sounds; the stags were barking in Richmond Park that winter's day. And so, the thought of love would be all ambered over with snow and winter; with log fires burning; with Russian women, gold swords, and the bark of stags; with old King James' slobbering and fireworks and sacks of treasure in the holds of Elizabethan sailing ships. Every single thing, once he tried to dislodge it from its place in his mind, he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of glass which, after a year at the bottom of the sea, is grown about with bones and dragon-flies, and coins and the tresses of drowned women.",in such thinking  or by whatever name it should be called  he spent months and years of his life  it would be no exaggeration to say that he would go out after breakfast a man of thirty and come home to dinner a man of fifty five at least  some weeks added a century to his age  others no more than three seconds at most  altogether  the task of estimating the length of human life  of the animals  we presume not to speak  is beyond our capacity  for directly we say that it is ages long  we are reminded that it is briefer than the fall of a rose leaf to the ground  of the two forces which alternately  and what is more confusing still  at the same moment  dominate our unfortunate numbskulls  brevity and diuturnity  orlando was sometimes under the influence of the elephant footed deity  then of the gnat winged fly  life seemed to him of prodigious length  yet even so  it went like a flash  but even when it stretched longest and the moments swelled biggest and he seemed to wander alone in deserts of vast eternity  there was no time for the smoothing out and deciphering of those scored parchments which thirty years among men and women had rolled tight in his heart and brain  long before he had done thinking about love  the oak tree had put forth its leaves and shaken them to the ground a dozen times in the process  ambition would jostle it off the field  to be replaced by friendship or literature  and as the first question had not been settled  what is love   back it would come at the least provocation or none  and hustle books or metaphors of what one lives for into the margin  there to wait till they saw their chance to rush into the field again  what made the process still longer was that it was profusely illustrated  not only with pictures  as that of old queen elizabeth  laid on her tapestry couch in rose coloured brocade with an ivory snuff box in her hand and a gold hilted sword by her side  but with scents  she was strongly perfumed  and with sounds  the stags were barking in richmond park that winter own day  and so  the thought of love would be all ambered over with snow and winter  with log fires burning  with russian women  gold swords  and the bark of stags  with old king james  slobbering and fireworks and sacks of treasure in the holds of elizabethan sailing ships  every single thing  once he tried to dislodge it from its place in his mind  he found thus cumbered with other matter like the lump of glass which  after a year at the bottom of the sea  is grown about with bones and dragon flies  and coins and the tresses of drowned women ,2586,464,4.3500000000000005,0.8970690042281123,1.0666666666666669,0.8970690042281123,0.13220852986941084,4.3500000000000005,0.908298042845341,1.0620689655172415,0.908298042845341,0.15425518726199955,41.84327590345331,0.6313268319256794,0.60389416172386,0.6313268319256794,0.1876721072842845,4.834658730158731,1.9344963977295928,2.2187321700551603,1.9344963977295928,0.4643833445218076,12.654999999999996,1.2718829128165379,1.290418958375772,1.2718829128165379,0.010078133810991739,68.02884857268974,1.6263472940412989,2.1826060580826194,1.6263472940412989,0.2934169099262227,2.711492104589472,1.5255555698954668,1.5128061612021555,1.5255555698954668,0.5126997029966527,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.9775}",0.9775,1.1443893839339936,0.5193587774232936,1.1443893839339936,0.03382435310685343,0.10595238095238095,-0.05425441268544703,-0.020203151155623336,-0.05425441268544703,-0.16498011704701443,0.7214586041628954,0.9108037980243004,0.7708017332715023,0.9108037980243004,-0.04640021116797406,75.76227939294114,1.714177461712663,1.4058208373754775,1.714177461712663,-0.4761891641048129,-0.998,-0.8044558179046343,-0.059280814799418054,-0.8044558179046343,0.09197367643606068

'And what's the point of it?' he would ask himself. 'Why not say simply in so many words--' and then he would try to think for half an hour,--or was it two years and a half?--how to say simply in so many words what love is. 'A figure like that is manifestly untruthful,' he argued, 'for no dragon-fly, unless under very exceptional circumstances, could live at the bottom of the sea.

98,98,1,"Orlando went on thinking. He kept looking at the grass and at the sky and trying to bethink him what a true poet, who has his verses published in London, would say about them. Memory meanwhile (whose habits have already been described) kept steady before his eyes the face of Nicholas Greene, as if that sardonic loose-lipped man, treacherous as he had proved himself, were the Muse in person, and it was to him that Orlando must do homage. So Orlando, that summer morning, offered him a variety of phrases, some plain, others figured, and Nick Greene kept shaking his head and sneering and muttering something about Glawr and Cicero and the death of poetry in our time. At length, starting to his feet (it was now winter and very cold) Orlando swore one of the most remarkable oaths of his lifetime, for it bound him to a servitude than which none is stricter. 'I'll be blasted', he said, 'if I ever write another word, or try to write another word, to please Nick Greene or the Muse. Bad, good, or indifferent, I'll write, from this day forward, to please myself'; and here he made as if he were tearing a whole budget of papers across and tossing them in the face of that sneering loose-lipped man.

99,99,1,"But Orlando, all the same, went on thinking. He had indeed much to think of. For when he tore the parchment across, he tore, in one rending, the scrolloping, emblazoned scroll which he had made out in his own favour in the solitude of his room appointing himself, as the King appoints Ambassadors, the first poet of his race, the first writer of his age, conferring eternal immortality upon his soul and granting his body a grave among laurels and the intangible banners of a people's reverence perpetually. Eloquent as this all was, he now tore it up and threw it in the dustbin. 'Fame', he said. 'is like' (and since there was no Nick Greene to stop him, he went on to revel in images of which we will choose only one or two of the quietest) 'a braided coat which hampers the limbs; a jacket of silver which curbs the heart; a painted shield which covers a scarecrow,' etc. etc. The pith of his phrases was that while fame impedes and constricts, obscurity wraps about a man like a mist; obscurity is dark, ample, and free; obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded. Over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness. None knows where he goes or comes. He may seek the truth and speak it; he alone is free; he alone is truthful; he alone is at peace. And so he sank into a quiet mood, under the oak tree, the hardness of whose roots, exposed above the ground, seemed to him rather comfortable than otherwise.",but orlando  all the same  went on thinking  he had indeed much to think of  for when he tore the parchment across  he tore  in one rending  the scrolloping  emblazoned scroll which he had made out in his own favour in the solitude of his room appointing himself  as the king appoints ambassadors  the first poet of his race  the first writer of his age  conferring eternal immortality upon his soul and granting his body a grave among laurels and the intangible banners of a people own reverence perpetually  eloquent as this all was  he now tore it up and threw it in the dustbin   fame   he said   is like   and since there was no nick greene to stop him  he went on to revel in images of which we will choose only one or two of the quietest   a braided coat which hampers the limbs  a jacket of silver which curbs the heart  a painted shield which covers a scarecrow   etc  etc  the pith of his phrases was that while fame impedes and constricts  obscurity wraps about a man like a mist  obscurity is dark  ample  and free  obscurity let us the mind take its way unimpeded  over the obscure man is poured the merciful suffusion of darkness  none knows where he goes or comes  he may seek the truth and speak it  he alone is free  he alone is truthful  he alone is at peace  and so he sank into a quiet mood  under the oak tree  the hardness of whose roots  exposed above the ground  seemed to him rather comfortable than otherwise ,1431,263,5.250000000000002,1.1281900706946204,1.3192982456140356,1.1281900706946204,0.4840476791045197,4.25,0.8821650509438808,1.0344827586206897,0.8821650509438808,0.3665181892808008,136.78373182520468,1.9986991085210168,1.974102057846433,1.9986991085210168,1.0823575048881635,2.6125000000000007,0.96514323495752,1.1433249583603873,0.96514323495752,0.4347645170226639,6.148999999999999,0.21094574635000357,0.40687173219257144,0.21094574635000357,-0.08513111094459616,51.34877234299913,1.122568142257475,1.5712367176728186,1.122568142257475,0.4998591101303701,0.17606471269544255,-0.13839944736677226,0.09823070540575271,-0.13839944736677226,0.0587339590514251,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9825}",0.9825,1.1519823575520725,0.5232974910394266,1.1519823575520725,0.26313492720871623,0.22666666666666666,0.7532496228361454,0.6345031557379579,0.7532496228361454,0.31591487352580205,0.6082583784628843,0.6280552636982534,0.5733092851038133,0.6280552636982534,0.19413892979508734,47.88960185316037,0.6129575245904552,0.6006456456146351,0.6129575245904552,-0.2561738622165191,-0.9759,-0.7789969972761611,-0.04703110926349344,-0.7789969972761611,-0.03522682588510976

It looked a town rather than a house, but a town built, not hither and thither, as this man wished or that, but circumspectly, by a single architect with one idea in his head. Courts and buildings, grey, red, plum colour, lay orderly and symmetrical; the courts were some of them oblong and some square; in this was a fountain; in that a statue; the buildings were some of them low, some pointed; here was a chapel, there a belfry; spaces of the greenest grass lay in between and clumps of cedar trees and beds of bright flowers; all were clasped--yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly--by the roll of a massive wall; while smoke from innumerable chimneys curled perpetually into the air. This vast, yet ordered building, which could house a thousand men and perhaps two thousand horses, was built, Orlando thought, by workmen whose names are unknown. Here have lived, for more centuries than I can count, the obscure generations of my own obscure family.

103,103,1,"Why, then, had he wished to raise himself above them? For it seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that anonymous work of creation; the labours of those vanished hands. Better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch, a potting shed, a wall where peaches ripen, than to burn like a meteor and leave no dust. For after all, he said, kindling as he looked at the great house on the greensward below, the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who come after; for the roof that will leak; for the tree that will fall. There was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the kitchen; always food for the hungry; always their goblets were polished, though they lay sick, and their windows were lit though they lay dying. Lords though they were, they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone-mason. Obscure noblemen, forgotten builders--thus he apostrophized them with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him cold, indifferent, slothful (the truth being that a quality often lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it)--thus he apostrophized his house and race in terms of the most moving eloquence; but when it came to the peroration--and what is eloquence that lacks a peroration?--he fumbled. He would have liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building. Since, however, the building already covered nine acres, to add even a single stone seemed superfluous. Could one mention furniture in a peroration? Could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to lie beside people's beds? For whatever the peroration wanted, that was what the house stood in need of. Leaving his speech unfinished for the moment, he strode down hill again resolved henceforward to devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion. The news--that she was to attend him instantly--brought tears to the eyes of good old Mrs Grimsditch, now grown somewhat old. Together they perambulated the house.",why  then  had he wished to raise himself above them  for it seemed vain and arrogant in the extreme to try to better that anonymous work of creation  the labours of those vanished hands  better was it to go unknown and leave behind you an arch  a potting she would  a wall where peaches ripen  than to burn like a meteor and leave no dust  for after all  he said  kindling as he looked at the great house on the greensward below  the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot to set aside something for those who come after  for the roof that will leak  for the tree that will fall  there was always a warm corner for the old shepherd in the kitchen  always food for the hungry  always their goblets were polished  though they lay sick  and their windows were lit though they lay dying  lords though they were  they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone mason  obscure noblemen  forgotten builders  thus he apostrophized them with a warmth that entirely gainsaid such critics as called him cold  indifferent  slothful  the truth being that a quality often lies just on the other side of the wall from where we seek it   thus he apostrophized his house and race in terms of the most moving eloquence  but when it came to the peroration  and what is eloquence that lacks a peroration   he fumbled  he would have liked to have ended with a flourish to the effect that he would follow in their footsteps and add another stone to their building  since  however  the building already covered nine acres  to add even a single stone seemed superfluous  could one mention furniture in a peroration  could one speak of chairs and tables and mats to lie beside people own beds  for whatever the peroration wanted  that was what the house stood in need of  leaving his speech unfinished for the moment  he strode down hill again resolved henceforward to devote himself to the furnishing of the mansion  the news  that she was to attend him instantly  brought tears to the eyes of good old mrs grimsditch  now grown somewhat old  together they perambulated the house ,2096,363,-2.45,-0.8491790535188358,-0.8421052631578947,-0.8491790535188358,-0.40365396120003877,-3.45,-1.1300753254685423,-1.089655172413793,-1.1300753254685423,-0.43638902004605234,-86.71906415061372,-1.2202819253467674,-1.2515544115509967,-1.2202819253467674,-0.49716436276802717,-0.9406746031746034,-0.5848275176820451,-0.5762234882943381,-0.5848275176820451,-0.3284520597133185,8.113000000000001,0.5312163573153089,0.6735927208528556,0.5312163573153089,-0.11032717932326866,-56.53659156464636,-2.1358340599182513,-2.3830499932406126,-2.1358340599182513,-0.9901963585868959,0.6645739394723132,0.18220029904010296,0.3707816624309589,0.18220029904010296,0.1606236106250789,"{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.8994}",0.8994,1.0257871360196,0.4578360707392965,1.0257871360196,0.08604792303976089,0.10212698412698412,-0.07984395542847188,-0.040950583103204305,-0.07984395542847188,-0.12475079966833794,0.43063253718641753,0.1843861281574119,0.26341801028870193,0.1843861281574119,-0.16336947535029894,62.46995031039745,1.1890116330765388,1.0218371457222386,1.1890116330765388,-0.37310320173357403,0.6188,1.0580700278924424,0.8368876879373657,1.0580700278924424,0.4063936179892256

116,116,1,"All now was ready; and when it was evening and the innumerable silver sconces were lit and the light airs which for ever moved about the galleries stirred the blue and green arras, so that it looked as if the huntsmen were riding and Daphne flying; when the silver shone and lacquer glowed and wood kindled; when the carved chairs held their arms out and dolphins swam upon the walls with mermaids on their backs; when all this and much more than all this was complete and to his liking, Orlando walked through the house with his elk hounds following and felt content. He had matter now, he thought, to fill out his peroration. Perhaps it would be well to begin the speech all over again. Yet, as he paraded the galleries he felt that still something was lacking. Chairs and tables, however richly gilt and carved, sofas, resting on lions' paws with swans' necks curving under them, beds even of the softest swansdown are not by themselves enough. People sitting in them, people lying in them improve them amazingly. Accordingly Orlando now began a series of very splendid entertainments to the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. The three hundred and sixty-five bedrooms were full for a month at a time. Guests jostled each other on the fifty-two staircases. Three hundred servants bustled about the pantries. Banquets took place almost nightly. Thus, in a very few years, Orlando had worn the nap off his velvet, and spent the half of his fortune; but he had earned the good opinion of his neighbours. held a score of offices in the county, and was annually presented with perhaps a dozen volumes dedicated to his Lordship in rather fulsome terms by grateful poets.

117,117,1,"But when the feasting was at its height and his guests were at their revels, he was apt to take himself off to his private room alone. There when the door was shut, and he was certain of privacy, he would have out an old writing book, stitched together with silk stolen from his mother's workbox, and labelled in a round schoolboy hand, 'The Oak Tree, A Poem'. In this he would write till midnight chimed and long after. But as he scratched out as many lines as he wrote in, the sum of them was often, at the end of the year, rather less than at the beginning, and it looked as if in the process of writing the poem would be completely unwritten. For it is for the historian of letters to remark that he had changed his style amazingly. His floridity was chastened; his abundance curbed; the age of prose was congealing those warm fountains. The very landscape outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars themselves were less thorned and intricate. Perhaps the senses were a little duller and honey and cream less seductive to the palate. Also that the streets were better drained and the houses better lit had its effect upon the style, it cannot be doubted.",but when the feasting was at its height and his guests were at their revels  he was apt to take himself off to his private room alone  there when the door was shut  and he was certain of privacy  he would have out an old writing book  stitched together with silk stolen from his mother own workbox  and labelled in a round schoolboy hand   the oak tree  a poem   in this he would write till midnight chimed and long after  but as he scratched out as many lines as he wrote in  the sum of them was often  at the end of the year  rather less than at the beginning  and it looked as if in the process of writing the poem would be completely unwritten  for it is for the historian of letters to remark that he had changed his style amazingly  his floridity was chastened  his abundance curbed  the age of prose was congealing those warm fountains  the very landscape outside was less stuck about with garlands and the briars themselves were less thorned and intricate  perhaps the senses were a little duller and honey and cream less seductive to the palate  also that the streets were better drained and the houses better lit had its effect upon the style  it cannot be doubted ,1173,215,2.8500000000000005,0.5118672267839326,0.6456140350877195,0.5118672267839326,0.26118040311576884,3.6500000000000004,0.7253670995351206,0.8689655172413794,0.7253670995351206,0.3920800043082595,31.371178983954437,0.4805032987277355,0.45275785477496094,0.4805032987277355,0.3036577807253216,1.552083333333334,0.5025668061278263,0.6301394170857515,0.5025668061278263,0.2693552054829502,-0.9399999999999996,-0.9450615658358654,-0.5558497996876485,-0.9450615658358654,-0.7637729376937639,52.03157814691542,1.143190549732911,1.5962633739194625,1.143190549732911,0.6983892756736584,-0.1826391144962731,-0.373810264050009,-0.1018987210837924,-0.373810264050009,-0.07452947039935634,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.6709}",0.6709,0.6787882416733919,0.27783685848201983,0.6787882416733919,0.17652710883659403,0.1705059523809524,0.37756912110309704,0.32990976295980523,0.37756912110309704,0.2636890083581516,0.6332298517293378,0.6904283501686197,0.6168752529210082,0.6904283501686197,0.39487409769113924,39.63268784569126,0.2867356066871157,0.36212308853958847,0.2867356066871157,-0.22987418892262737,-0.9977,-0.804110223054474,-0.059114529203907785,-0.804110223054474,-0.111053597506912
118,118,1,"One day he was adding a line or two with enormous labour to 'The Oak Tree, A Poem', when a shadow crossed the tail of his eye. It was no shadow, he soon saw, but the figure of a very tall lady in riding hood and mantle crossing the quadrangle on which his room looked out. As this was the most private of the courts, and the lady was a stranger to him, Orlando marvelled how she had got there. Three days later the same apparition appeared again; and on Wednesday noon appeared once more. This time, Orlando was determined to follow her, nor apparently was she afraid to be found, for she slackened her steps as he came up and looked him full in the face. Any other woman thus caught in a Lord's private grounds would have been afraid; any other woman with that face, head-dress, and aspect would have thrown her mantilla across her shoulders to hide it. For this lady resembled nothing so much as a hare; a hare startled, but obdurate; a hare whose timidity is overcome by an immense and foolish audacity; a hare that sits upright and glowers at its pursuer with great, bulging eyes; with ears erect but quivering, with nose pointed, but twitching. This hare, moreover, was six feet high and wore a head-dress into the bargain of some antiquated kind which made her look still taller. Thus confronted, she stared at Orlando with a stare in which timidity and audacity were most strangely combined.",one day he was adding a line or two with enormous labour to  the oak tree  a poem   when a shadow crossed the tail of his eye  it was no shadow  he soon saw  but the figure of a very tall lady in riding hood and mantle crossing the quadrangle on which his room looked out  as this was the most private of the courts  and the lady was a stranger to him  orlando marvelled how she had got there  three days later the same apparition appeared again  and on wednesday noon appeared once more  this time  orlando was determined to follow her  nor apparently was she afraid to be found  for she slackened her steps as he came up and looked him full in the face  any other woman thus caught in a lord own private grounds would have been afraid  any other woman with that face  head dress  and aspect would have thrown her mantilla across her shoulders to hide it  for this lady resembled nothing so much as a hare  a hare startled  but obdurate  a hare whose timidity is overcome by an immense and foolish audacity  a hare that sits upright and glowers at its pursuer with great  bulging eyes  with ears erect but quivering  with nose pointed  but twitching  this hare  moreover  was six feet high and wore a head dress into the bargain of some antiquated kind which made her look still taller  thus confronted  she stared at orlando with a stare in which timidity and audacity were most strangely combined ,1398,254,-3.15,-1.028939882992786,-1.0385964912280703,-1.028939882992786,-0.5914967749744584,-3.65,-1.182341309271462,-1.1448275862068966,-1.182341309271462,-0.5886228771554706,-106.8853057936644,-1.5107245978420063,-1.542599396180076,-1.5107245978420063,-0.875742285957271,-1.4550595238095236,-0.8092132210670164,-0.8251585646821185,-0.8092132210670164,-0.5196204907137896,5.890000000000002,0.16871046720539412,0.37169824132545703,0.16871046720539412,-0.08980788887246327,-19.293750854523626,-1.0110090624419823,-1.0180004187425138,-1.0110090624419823,-0.6514712659284762,-0.35404019523612,-0.4862976849767759,-0.1975274749131187,-0.4862976849767759,-0.12229017238046935,"{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.036}",-0.036,-0.39470636845061113,-0.27901847256685963,-0.39470636845061113,-0.28266786871025606,0.13454545454545455,0.1370155946525526,0.13487431547633313,0.1370155946525526,0.06378362972876614,0.5324625809750528,0.4387345223725924,0.44107370417517255,0.4387345223725924,0.12543988266577935,45.1401248926053,0.5043286050580538,0.5212198123484436,0.5043286050580538,-0.30732308109550766,-0.8607,-0.6462885748146178,0.016822559412457496,-0.6462885748146178,-0.008962511466268122

She desired above all things to make his acquaintance, she said. She had taken lodging over a baker's shop at the Park Gates. She had seen his picture and it was the image of a sister of hers who was--here she guffawed--long since dead. She was visiting the English court. The Queen was her Cousin.

120,120,1,"Indoors, her manners regained the hauteur natural to a Roumanian Archduchess; and had she not shown a knowledge of wines rare in a lady, and made some observations upon firearms and the customs of sportsmen in her country, which were sensible enough, the talk would have lacked spontaneity. Jumping to her feet at last, she announced that she would call the following day, swept another prodigious curtsey and departed. The following day, Orlando rode out.

At this hour the mist would lie so thick that the domes of Santa Sofia and the rest would seem to be afloat; gradually the mist would uncover them; the bubbles would be seen to be firmly fixed; there would be the river; there the Galata Bridge; there the green-turbaned pilgrims without eyes or noses, begging alms; there the pariah dogs picking up offal; there the shawled women; there the innumerable donkeys; there men on horses carrying long poles. Soon, the whole town would be astir with the cracking of whips, the beating of gongs, cryings to prayer, lashing of mules, and rattle of brass-bound wheels, while sour odours, made from bread fermenting and incense, and spice, rose even to the heights of Pera itself and seemed the very breath of the strident multi-coloured and barbaric population.",orlando own day was passed  it would seem  somewhat in this fashion  about seven  he would rise  wrap himself in a long turkish cloak  light a cheroot  and lean his elbows on the parapet  thus he would stand  gazing at the city beneath him  apparently entranced  at this hour the mist would lie so thick that the domes of santa sofia and the rest would seem to be afloat  gradually the mist would uncover them  the bubbles would be seen to be firmly fixed  there would be the river  there the galata bridge  there the green turbaned pilgrims without eyes or noses  begging alms  there the pariah dogs picking up offal  there the shawled women  there the innumerable donkeys  there men on horses carrying long poles  soon  the whole town would be astir with the cracking of whips  the beating of gongs  cryings to prayer  lashing of mules  and rattle of brass bound wheels  while sour odours  made from bread fermenting and incense  and spice  rose even to the heights of pera itself and seemed the very breath of the strident multi coloured and barbaric population ,1063,182,-4.7,-1.4269817196851053,-1.4736842105263157,-1.4269817196851053,-1.03757278332424,-3.7,-1.1954078052221924,-1.1586206896551725,-1.1954078052221924,-0.775072032080723,-144.56097351343337,-2.053345370431189,-2.086345441004899,-2.053345370431189,-1.6529956446091412,-1.6166666666666663,-0.8797097130273093,-0.9033678683341327,-0.8797097130273093,-0.7118255905879521,-3.4680000000000017,-1.3573039815793946,-0.8991647993481363,-1.3573039815793946,-1.1228202933068754,-26.271289584148153,-1.2217478201277576,-1.2737458477244958,-1.2217478201277576,-0.9417982348828017,-0.5633012953483851,-0.6236319500252828,-0.31427923716754197,-0.6236319500252828,-0.271545158627511,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.984, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4588}",-0.4588,-1.0367682175953679,-0.6120760959470636,-1.0367682175953679,-0.6175624641976689,0.10769230769230767,-0.042615377125660894,-0.010766480065517205,-0.042615377125660894,0.11085515950851406,0.22919367089029877,-0.31876255241560364,-0.08801816940913028,-0.31876255241560364,-0.14020415662464117,34.73691321315042,0.09330874178271419,0.2206958333737419,0.09330874178271419,-0.1535596877852063,-0.8925,-0.6829216289316061,-0.0008037137116330977,-0.6829216289316061,-0.1325323365063755

To the right and left rose in bald and stony prominence the inhospitable Asian mountains, to which the arid castle of a robber chief or two might hang; but parsonage there was none, nor manor house, nor cottage, nor oak, elm, violet, ivy, or wild eglantine. There were no hedges for ferns to grow on, and no fields for sheep to graze. The houses were white as egg-shells and as bald. That he, who was English root and fibre, should yet exult to the depths of his heart in this wild panorama, and gaze and gaze at those passes and far heights planning journeys there alone on foot where only the goat and shepherd had gone before; should feel a passion of affection for the bright, unseasonable flowers, love the unkempt pariah dogs beyond even his elk hounds at home, and snuff the acrid, sharp smell of the streets eagerly into his nostrils, surprised him.

133,133,2,"After luncheon, lackeys announced that his coach and six was at the door, and he went, preceded by purple Janissaries running on foot and waving great ostrich feather fans above their heads, to call upon the other ambassadors and dignitaries of state. The ceremony was always the same. On reaching the courtyard, the Janissaries struck with their fans upon the main portal, which immediately flew open revealing a large chamber, splendidly furnished. Here were seated two figures, generally of the opposite sexes. Profound bows and curtseys were exchanged. In the first room, it was permissible only to mention the weather. Having said that it was fine or wet, hot or cold, the Ambassador then passed on to the next chamber, where again, two figures rose to greet him. Here it was only permissible to compare Constantinople as a place of residence with London; and the Ambassador naturally said that he preferred Constantinople, and his hosts naturally said, though they had not seen it, that they preferred London. In the next chamber, King Charles's and the Sultan's healths had to be discussed at some length. In the next were discussed the Ambassador's health and that of his host's wife, but more briefly. In the next the Ambassador complimented his host upon his furniture, and the host complimented the Ambassador upon his dress. In the next, sweet meats were offered, the host deploring their badness, the Ambassador extolling their goodness. The ceremony ended at length with the smoking of a hookah and the drinking of a glass of coffee; but though the motions of smoking and drinking were gone through punctiliously there was neither tobacco in the pipe nor coffee in the glass, as, had either smoke or drink been real, the human frame would have sunk beneath the surfeit. For, no sooner had the Ambassador despatched one such visit, than another had to be undertaken. The same ceremonies were gone through in precisely the same order six or seven times over at the houses of the other great officials, so that it was often late at night before the Ambassador reached home. Though Orlando performed these tasks to admiration and never denied that they are, perhaps, the most important part of a diplomatist's duties, he was undoubtedly fatigued by them, and often depressed to such a pitch of gloom that he preferred to take his dinner alone with his dogs. To them, indeed, he might be heard talking in his own tongue. And sometimes, it is said, he would pass out of his own gates late at night so disguised that the sentries did not know him. Then he would mingle with the crowd on the Galata Bridge; or stroll through the bazaars; or throw aside his shoes and join the worshippers in the Mosques. Once, when it was given out that he was ill of a fever, shepherds, bringing their goats to market, reported that they had met an English Lord on the mountain top and heard him praying to his God. This was thought to be Orlando himself, and his prayer was, no doubt, a poem said aloud, for it was known that he still carried about with him, in the bosom of his cloak, a much scored manuscript; and servants, listening at the door, heard the Ambassador chanting something in an odd, sing-song voice when he was alone.",after luncheon  lackeys announced that his coach and six was at the door  and he went  preceded by purple janissaries running on foot and waving great ostrich feather fans above their heads  to call upon the other ambassadors and dignitaries of state  the ceremony was always the same  on reaching the courtyard  the janissaries struck with their fans upon the main portal  which immediately flew open revealing a large chamber  splendidly furnished  here were seated two figures  generally of the opposite sexes  profound bows and curtseys were exchanged  in the first room  it was permissible only to mention the weather  having said that it was fine or wet  hot or cold  the ambassador then passed on to the next chamber  where again  two figures rose to greet him  here it was only permissible to compare constantinople as a place of residence with london  and the ambassador naturally said that he preferred constantinople  and his hosts naturally said  though they had not seen it  that they preferred london  in the next chamber  king charles own and the sultan own healths had to be discussed at some length  in the next were discussed the ambassador own health and that of his host own wife  but more briefly  in the next the ambassador complimented his host upon his furniture  and the host complimented the ambassador upon his dress  in the next  sweet meats were offered  the host deploring their badness  the ambassador extolling their goodness  the ceremony ended at length with the smoking of a hookah and the drinking of a glass of coffee  but though the motions of smoking and drinking were gone through punctiliously there was neither tobacco in the pipe nor coffee in the glass  as  had either smoke or drink been real  the human frame would have sunk beneath the surfeit  for  no sooner had the ambassador despatched one such visit  than another had to be undertaken  the same ceremonies were gone through in precisely the same order six or seven times over at the houses of the other great officials  so that it was often late at night before the ambassador reached home  though orlando performed these tasks to admiration and never denied that they are  perhaps  the most important part of a diplomatist own duties  he was undoubtedly fatigued by them  and often depressed to such a pitch of gloom that he preferred to take his dinner alone with his dogs  to them  indeed  he might be heard talking in his own tongue  and sometimes  it is said  he would pass out of his own gates late at night so disguised that the sentries did not know him  then he would mingle with the crowd on the galata bridge  or stroll through the bazaars  or throw aside his shoes and join the worshippers in the mosques  once  when it was given out that he was ill of a fever  shepherds  bringing their goats to market  reported that they had met an english lord on the mountain top and heard him praying to his god  this was thought to be orlando himself  and his prayer was  no doubt  a poem said aloud  for it was known that he still carried about with him  in the bosom of his cloak  a much scored manuscript  and servants  listening at the door  heard the ambassador chanting something in an odd  sing song voice when he was alone ,3225,560,5.749999999999998,1.2565906631760129,1.4596491228070172,1.2565906631760129,0.1618810314723716,4.999999999999999,1.0781624902048308,1.2413793103448274,1.0781624902048308,0.14028841980366952,40.879764816403835,0.6174499410277724,0.589988493306121,0.6174499410277724,0.15191910551198465,-0.5154761904761902,-0.3993468764654608,-0.37044996131304037,-0.3993468764654608,-0.22663397881379976,11.642000000000005,1.1066924194826013,1.152848509540301,1.1066924194826013,-0.14848876267133912,55.08429891165865,1.2353901929670197,1.70815374268614,1.2353901929670197,0.0885858137162992,0.0,-0.25394752537091686,0.0,-0.25394752537091686,0.0,"{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9341}",0.9341,1.0784823729290682,0.4851707432352595,1.0784823729290682,-0.02792044749127767,0.16543367346938773,0.34363870709995287,0.302399738159719,0.34363870709995287,-0.11406588728516547,1.459265720908675,2.753678929987712,2.0580017618987743,2.753678929987712,0.28714954779030594,88.21801671313183,2.2062904368286884,1.76563738786631,2.2062904368286884,-0.5434326451907155,-0.9989,-0.8054926024551149,-0.05977967158594893,-0.8054926024551149,0.12191168710569754
134,134,2,"It is with fragments such as these that we must do our best to make up a picture of Orlando's life and character at this time. There exist, even to this day, rumours, legends, anecdotes of a floating and unauthenticated kind about Orlando's life in Constantinople--(we have quoted but a few of them) which go to prove that he possessed, now that he was in the prime of life, the power to stir the fancy and rivet the eye which will keep a memory green long after all that more durable qualities can do to preserve it is forgotten. The power is a mysterious one compounded of beauty, birth, and some rarer gift, which we may call glamour and have done with it. 'A million candles', as Sasha had said, burnt in him without his being at the trouble of lighting a single one. He moved like a stag, without any need to think about his legs. He spoke in his ordinary voice and echo beat a silver gong. Hence rumours gathered round him. He became the adored of many women and some men. It was not necessary that they should speak to him or even that they should see him; they conjured up before them especially when the scenery was romantic, or the sun was setting, the figure of a noble gentleman in silk stockings. Upon the poor and uneducated, he had the same power as upon the rich. Shepherds, gipsies, donkey drivers, still sing songs about the English Lord 'who dropped his emeralds in the well', which undoubtedly refer to Orlando, who once, it seems, tore his jewels from him in a moment of rage or intoxication and flung them in a fountain; whence they were fished by a page boy. But this romantic power, it is well known, is often associated with a nature of extreme reserve. Orlando seems to have made no friends. As far as is known, he formed no attachments. A certain great lady came all the way from England in order to be near him, and pestered him with her attentions, but he continued to discharge his duties so indefatigably that he had not been Ambassador at the Horn for more than two years and a half before King Charles signified his intention of raising him to the highest rank in the peerage. The envious said that this was Nell Gwyn's tribute to the memory of a leg.

Next, Sir Adrian Scrope, in the full dress of a British Admiral, advanced; the Ambassador knelt on one knee; the Admiral placed the Collar of the Most Noble Order of the Bath round his neck, then pinned the Star to his breast; after which another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing in a stately manner placed on his shoulders the ducal robes, and handed him on a crimson cushion, the ducal coronet.'",from the gazette of the time  we gather that  as the clock struck twelve  the ambassador appeared on the centre balcony which was hung with priceless rugs  six turks of the imperial body guard  each over six foot in height  held torches to his right and left  rockets rose into the air at his appearance  and a great shout went up from the people  which the ambassador acknowledged  bowing deeply  and speaking a few words of thanks in the turkish language  which it was one of his accomplishments to speak with fluency  next  sir adrian scrope  in the full dress of a british admiral  advanced  the ambassador knelt on one knee  the admiral placed the collar of the most noble order of the bath round his neck  then pinned the star to his breast  after which another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing in a stately manner placed on his shoulders the ducal robes  and handed him on a crimson cushion  the ducal coronet  ,929,164,6.999999999999999,1.577592144379496,1.8105263157894735,1.577592144379496,1.2391375835701106,8.0,1.8621522472486323,2.0689655172413794,1.8621522472486323,1.387077905108244,98.36280959581896,1.445344867827389,1.4196002861422334,1.445344867827389,1.2481854342180863,2.83125,1.0605666633015625,1.249188380430793,1.0605666633015625,0.8814425561732154,5.949999999999998,0.1784947017562684,0.3798465403680314,0.1784947017562684,0.23032559395986107,112.58377735497359,2.9720152586621054,3.815663188429787,2.9720152586621054,2.5853298339051873,1.9231263223398494,1.0081654040377976,1.0729580751061216,1.0081654040377976,1.028813528436688,"{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.9312}",0.9312,1.0740784482305823,0.48288628933790223,1.0740784482305823,0.5365389135645405,0.28904761904761905,1.1705396766954301,0.9728326476632407,1.1705396766954301,0.9995890646632318,0.8484985560689988,1.2281208349840487,0.9924393754395547,1.2281208349840487,1.1021496915267939,32.88546011201142,0.020159792790961032,0.16721176806935326,0.020159792790961032,-0.04057558948544801,0.9583,1.4491681999904804,1.025067553523176,1.4491681999904804,0.7438974634455293
138,138,2,"At length, with a gesture of extraordinary majesty and grace, first bowing profoundly, then raising himself proudly erect, Orlando took the golden circlet of strawberry leaves and placed it, with a gesture which none that saw it ever forgot, upon his brows. It was at this point that the first disturbance began. Either the people had expected a miracle--some say a shower of gold was prophesied to fall from the skies--which did not happen, or this was the signal chosen for the attack to begin; nobody seems to know; but as the coronet settled on Orlando's brows a great uproar rose. Bells began ringing; the harsh cries of the prophets were heard above the shouts of the people; many Turks fell flat to the ground and touched the earth with their foreheads. A door burst open.

139,139,2,"So far, we are on the firm, if rather narrow, ground of ascertained truth. But nobody has ever known exactly what took place later that night. The testimony of the sentries and others seems, however, to prove that the Embassy was empty of company, and shut up for the night in the usual way by two A.M. The Ambassador was seen to go to his room, still wearing the insignia of his rank, and shut the door. Some say he locked it, which was against his custom. Others maintain that they heard music of a rustic kind, such as shepherds play, later that night in the courtyard under the Ambassador's window. A washer-woman, who was kept awake by toothache, said that she saw a man's figure, wrapped in a cloak or dressing gown, come out upon the balcony. Then, she said, a woman, much muffled, but apparently of the peasant class, was drawn up by means of a rope which the man let down to her on to the balcony. There, the washer-woman said, they embraced passionately 'like lovers', and went into the room together, drawing the curtains so that no more could be seen.",so far  we are on the firm  if rather narrow  ground of ascertained truth  but nobody has ever known exactly what took place later that night  the testimony of the sentries and others seems  however  to prove that the embassy was empty of company  and shut up for the night in the usual way by two a m  the ambassador was seen to go to his room  still wearing the insignia of his rank  and shut the door  some say he locked it  which was against his custom  others maintain that they heard music of a rustic kind  such as shepherds play  later that night in the courtyard under the ambassador own window  a washer woman  who was kept awake by toothache  said that she saw a man own figure  wrapped in a cloak or dressing gown  come out upon the balcony  then  she said  a woman  much muffled  but apparently of the peasant class  was drawn up by means of a rope which the man let down to her on to the balcony  there  the washer woman said  they embraced passionately  like lovers   and went into the room together  drawing the curtains so that no more could be seen ,1063,195,3.6,0.7044681155060224,0.856140350877193,0.7044681155060224,0.43418329618262064,3.6,0.7123006035843905,0.8551724137931035,0.7123006035843905,0.4385326233753919,31.754512889783992,0.4860242344597309,0.45829023967368177,0.4860242344597309,0.3388932172534942,1.1845238095238093,0.34222948095110084,0.4522600616341162,0.34222948095110084,0.199613061803848,1.2619999999999993,-0.5859801578187568,-0.2568072248251511,-0.5859801578187568,-0.49860175263517315,45.756666123991536,0.9536728393282177,1.3662710902058008,0.9536728393282177,0.6671534423717475,0.370485813300544,-0.010804404871062583,0.20670287774410162,-0.010804404871062583,0.1666900486847577,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9544}",0.9544,1.1093098458184687,0.5011619205167593,1.1093098458184687,0.4262247973932431,0.02191358024691357,-0.6164220990409717,-0.47599620431478984,-0.6164220990409717,-0.25301193892211504,0.21559457836046247,-0.3527300066074828,-0.11174354680982249,-0.3527300066074828,-0.1889823755242803,37.0485813300544,0.18464029809664087,0.28747441310147276,0.18464029809664087,-0.16372979303880608,-0.9837,-0.7879824633803281,-0.051354534746760966,-0.7879824633803281,-0.14401207549888914
140,140,2,"Next morning, the Duke, as we must now call him, was found by his secretaries sunk in profound slumber amid bed clothes that were much tumbled. The room was in some disorder, his coronet having rolled on the floor, and his cloak and garter being flung all of a heap on a chair. The table was littered with papers. No suspicion was felt at first, as the fatigues of the night had been great. But when afternoon came and he still slept, a doctor was summoned. He applied remedies which had been used on the previous occasion, plasters, nettles, emetics, etc., but without success. Orlando slept on. His secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the papers on the table. Many were scribbled over with poetry, in which frequent mention was made of an oak tree. There were also various state papers and others of a private nature concerning the management of his estates in England. But at length they came upon a document of far greater significance. It was nothing less, indeed, than a deed of marriage, drawn up, signed, and witnessed between his Lordship, Orlando, Knight of the Garter, etc., etc., etc., and Rosina Pepita, a dancer, father unknown, but reputed a gipsy, mother also unknown but reputed a seller of old iron in the market-place over against the Galata Bridge. The secretaries looked at each other in dismay. And still Orlando slept. Morning and evening they watched him, but, save that his breathing was regular and his cheeks still flushed their habitual deep rose, he gave no sign of life.

170,170,2,"We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative to make certain statements. Orlando had become a woman--there is no denying it. But in every other respect, Orlando remained precisely as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity. Their faces remained, as their portraits prove, practically the same. His memory--but in future we must, for convention's sake, say 'her' for 'his,' and 'she' for 'he'--her memory then, went back through all the events of her past life without encountering any obstacle. Some slight haziness there may have been, as if a few dark drops had fallen into the clear pool of memory; certain things had become a little dimmed; but that was all. The change seemed to have been accomplished painlessly and completely and in such a way that Orlando herself showed no surprise at it.

171,171,2,"But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit such odious subjects as soon as we can. Orlando had now washed, and dressed herself in those Turkish coats and trousers which can be worn indifferently by either sex; and was forced to consider her position. That it was precarious and embarrassing in the extreme must be the first thought of every reader who has followed her story with sympathy. Young, noble, beautiful, she had woken to find herself in a position than which we can conceive none more delicate for a young lady of rank. We should not have blamed her had she rung the bell, screamed, or fainted. But Orlando showed no such signs of perturbation. All her actions were deliberate in the extreme, and might indeed have been thought to show tokens of premeditation. First, she carefully examined the papers on the table; took such as seemed to be written in poetry, and secreted them in her bosom; next she called her Seleuchi hound, which had never left her bed all these days, though half famished with hunger, fed and combed him; then stuck a pair of pistols in her belt; finally wound about her person several strings of emeralds and pearls of the finest orient which had formed part of her Ambassadorial wardrobe. This done, she leant out of the window, gave one low whistle, and descended the shattered and bloodstained staircase, now strewn with the litter of waste-paper baskets, treaties, despatches, seals, sealing wax, etc., and so entered the courtyard. There, in the shadow of a giant fig tree, waited an old gipsy on a donkey. He led another by the bridle. Orlando swung her leg over it; and thus, attended by a lean dog, riding a donkey, in company of a gipsy, the Ambassador of Great Britain at the Court of the Sultan left Constantinople.",but let other pens treat of sex and sexuality  we quit such odious subjects as soon as we can  orlando had now washed  and dressed herself in those turkish coats and trousers which can be worn indifferently by either sex  and was forced to consider her position  that it was precarious and embarrassing in the extreme must be the first thought of every reader who has followed her story with sympathy  young  noble  beautiful  she had woken to find herself in a position than which we can conceive none more delicate for a young lady of rank  we should not have blamed her had she rung the bell  screamed  or fainted  but orlando showed no such signs of perturbation  all her actions were deliberate in the extreme  and might indeed have been thought to show tokens of premeditation  first  she carefully examined the papers on the table  took such as seemed to be written in poetry  and secreted them in her bosom  next she called her seleuchi hound  which had never left her bed all these days  though half famished with hunger  fed and combed him  then stuck a pair of pistols in her belt  finally wound about her person several strings of emeralds and pearls of the finest orient which had formed part of her ambassadorial wardrobe  this done  she leant out of the window  gave one low whistle  and descended the shattered and bloodstained staircase  now strewn with the litter of waste paper baskets  treaties  despatches  seals  sealing wax  etc   and so entered the courtyard  there  in the shadow of a giant fig tree  waited an old gipsy on a donkey  he led another by the bridle  orlando swung her leg over it  and thus  attended by a lean dog  riding a donkey  in company of a gipsy  the ambassador of great britain at the court of the sultan left constantinople ,1773,312,-4.4,-1.3499413641962694,-1.3894736842105264,-1.3499413641962694,-0.6480260956135739,-4.4,-1.3783387485324128,-1.3517241379310345,-1.3783387485324128,-0.5802535321491464,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,-3.035416666666666,-1.4985988054301016,-1.5899677771907672,-1.4985988054301016,-0.763384652110371,8.854,0.6520516540186135,0.7742242140286548,0.6520516540186135,0.03708699888016386,-6.350737304093535,-0.6200983556698011,-0.5436044059019695,-0.6200983556698011,-0.41541336561009007,-0.17105118782359774,-0.366205317922066,-0.09543354022034445,-0.366205317922066,-0.04809990322553073,"{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.4795}",-0.4795,-1.0682031283742146,-0.6283823703178542,-1.0682031283742146,-0.47904935364142964,0.024425287356321844,-0.5996203293507135,-0.46237370325065574,-0.5996203293507135,-0.27889061709159474,0.1230556514226984,-0.5838712945153158,-0.27318968456030696,-0.5838712945153158,-0.41470081958816724,53.367970600962494,0.8294020652836337,0.7589026555754684,0.8294020652836337,-0.3852958214769661,-0.9983,-0.8048014127547944,-0.05944710039492833,-0.8048014127547944,0.00644255471219232
172,172,2,"They rode for several days and nights and met with a variety of adventures, some at the hands of men, some at the hands of nature, in all of which Orlando acquitted herself with courage. Within a week they reached the high ground outside Broussa, which was then the chief camping ground of the gipsy tribe to which Orlando had allied herself. Often she had looked at those mountains from her balcony at the Embassy; often had longed to be there; and to find oneself where one has longed to be always, to a reflective mind, gives food for thought. For some time, however, she was too well pleased with the change to spoil it by thinking. The pleasure of having no documents to seal or sign, no flourishes to make, no calls to pay, was enough. The gipsies followed the grass; when it was grazed down, on they moved again. She washed in streams if she washed at all; no boxes, red, blue, or green, were presented to her; there was not a key, let alone a golden key, in the whole camp; as for 'visiting', the word was unknown. She milked the goats; she collected brushwood; she stole a hen's egg now and then, but always put a coin or a pearl in place of it; she herded cattle; she stripped vines; she trod the grape; she filled the goat-skin and drank from it; and when she remembered how, at about this time of day, she should have been making the motions of drinking and smoking over an empty coffee-cup and a pipe which lacked tobacco, she laughed aloud, cut herself another hunch of bread, and begged for a puff from old Rustum's pipe, filled though it was with cow dung.",they rode for several days and nights and met with a variety of adventures  some at the hands of men  some at the hands of nature  in all of which orlando acquitted herself with courage  within a week they reached the high ground outside broussa  which was then the chief camping ground of the gipsy tribe to which orlando had allied herself  often she had looked at those mountains from her balcony at the embassy  often had longed to be there  and to find oneself where one has longed to be always  to a reflective mind  gives food for thought  for some time  however  she was too well pleased with the change to spoil it by thinking  the pleasure of having no documents to seal or sign  no flourishes to make  no calls to pay  was enough  the gipsies followed the grass  when it was grazed down  on they moved again  she washed in streams if she washed at all  no boxes  red  blue  or green  were presented to her  there was not a key  let alone a golden key  in the whole camp  as for  visiting   the word was unknown  she milked the goats  she collected brushwood  she stole a hen own egg now and then  but always put a coin or a pearl in place of it  she herded cattle  she stripped vines  she trod the grape  she filled the goat skin and drank from it  and when she remembered how  at about this time of day  she should have been making the motions of drinking and smoking over an empty coffee cup and a pipe which lacked tobacco  she laughed aloud  cut herself another hunch of bread  and begged for a puff from old rustum own pipe  filled though it was with cow dung ,1572,293,1.9499999999999995,0.28074616031742455,0.3929824561403507,0.28074616031742455,0.0418238620173882,1.9499999999999995,0.2811062372102998,0.39999999999999986,0.2811062372102998,0.06916754250732735,44.818046760631304,0.6741707298176529,0.646826908128828,0.6741707298176529,0.31832983054870356,4.478516666666667,1.7791396129253205,2.046378261097511,1.7791396129253205,0.7608693658762105,16.483,1.896117077162357,1.8102804372920491,1.896117077162357,0.7187964313595676,6.371970613207443,-0.2358414185484701,-0.07728318287413388,-0.2358414185484701,-0.23667723522038245,0.5178009490476657,0.08587584715618075,0.28889350799501257,0.08587584715618075,0.15504862670782088,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': 0.6451}",0.6451,0.6396084978041043,0.2575130962227737,0.6396084978041043,0.047200370589889615,0.14868686868686867,0.23161292354038474,0.21157172516561754,0.23161292354038474,0.04689906884612449,0.5735036343760994,0.5412457817325799,0.5126751348386871,0.5412457817325799,0.08133773335383981,51.78009490476657,0.7666667800988107,0.7130327129999052,0.7666667800988107,-0.31894036065839776,-0.9987,-0.8052622058883414,-0.05966881452227542,-0.8052622058883414,-0.010589414421461068

177,177,2,"All the young men and women burst out laughing uproariously. The sky good to eat, indeed! The elders, however, who had seen more of foreigners than they had, became suspicious. They noticed that Orlando often sat for whole hours doing nothing whatever, except look here and then there; they would come upon her on some hill-top staring straight in front of her, no matter whether the goats were grazing or straying. They began to suspect that she had other beliefs than their own, and the older men and women thought it probable that she had fallen into the clutches of the vilest and cruellest among all the Gods, which is Nature. Nor were they far wrong. The English disease, a love of Nature, was inborn in her, and here, where Nature was so much larger and more powerful than in England, she fell into its hands as she had never done before. The malady is too well known, and has been, alas, too often described to need describing afresh, save very briefly. There were mountains; there were valleys; there were streams. She climbed the mountains; roamed the valleys; sat on the banks of the streams. She likened the hills to ramparts, to the breasts of doves, and the flanks of kine. She compared the flowers to enamel and the turf to Turkey rugs worn thin. Trees were withered hags, and sheep were grey boulders. Everything, in fact, was something else. She found the tarn on the mountain-top and almost threw herself in to seek the wisdom she thought lay hid there; and when, from the mountain-top, she beheld far off, across the Sea of Marmara, the plains of Greece, and made out (her eyes were admirable) the Acropolis with a white streak or two, which must, she thought, be the Parthenon, her soul expanded with her eyeballs, and she prayed that she might share the majesty of the hills, know the serenity of the plains, etc. etc., as all such believers do. Then, looking down, the red hyacinth, the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy at the goodness, the beauty of nature; raising her eyes again, she beheld the eagle soaring, and imagined its raptures and made them her own. Returning home, she saluted each star, each peak, and each watch-fire as if they signalled to her alone; and at last, when she flung herself upon her mat in the gipsies' tent, she could not help bursting out again, How good to eat! How good to eat! (For it is a curious fact that though human beings have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say 'good to eat' when they mean 'beautiful' and the other way about, they will yet endure ridicule and misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to themselves.) All the young gipsies laughed. But Rustum el Sadi, the old man who had brought Orlando out of Constantinople on his donkey, sat silent. He had a nose like a scimitar; his cheeks were furrowed as if from the age-long descent of iron hail; he was brown and keen-eyed, and as he sat tugging at his hookah he observed Orlando narrowly. He had the deepest suspicion that her God was Nature. One day he found her in tears. Interpreting this to mean that her God had punished her, he told her that he was not surprised. He showed her the fingers of his left hand, withered by the frost; he showed her his right foot, crushed where a rock had fallen. This, he said, was what her God did to men. When she said, 'But so beautiful', using the English word, he shook his head; and when she repeated it he was angry. He saw that she did not believe what he believed, and that was enough, wise and ancient as he was, to enrage him.",all the young men and women burst out laughing uproariously  the sky good to eat  indeed  the elders  however  who had seen more of foreigners than they had  became suspicious  they noticed that orlando often sat for whole hours doing nothing whatever  except look here and then there  they would come upon her on some hill top staring straight in front of her  no matter whether the goats were grazing or straying  they began to suspect that she had other beliefs than their own  and the older men and women thought it probable that she had fallen into the clutches of the vilest and cruellest among all the gods  which is nature  nor were they far wrong  the english disease  a love of nature  was inborn in her  and here  where nature was so much larger and more powerful than in england  she fell into its hands as she had never done before  the malady is too well known  and has been  alas  too often described to need describing afresh  save very briefly  there were mountains  there were valleys  there were streams  she climbed the mountains  roamed the valleys  sat on the banks of the streams  she likened the hills to ramparts  to the breasts of doves  and the flanks of kine  she compared the flowers to enamel and the turf to turkey rugs worn thin  trees were withered hags  and sheep were grey boulders  everything  in fact  was something else  she found the tarn on the mountain top and almost threw herself in to seek the wisdom she thought lay hid there  and when  from the mountain top  she beheld far off  across the sea of marmara  the plains of greece  and made out  her eyes were admirable  the acropolis with a white streak or two  which must  she thought  be the parthenon  her soul expanded with her eyeballs  and she prayed that she might share the majesty of the hills  know the serenity of the plains  etc  etc   as all such believers do  then  looking down  the red hyacinth  the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy at the goodness  the beauty of nature  raising her eyes again  she beheld the eagle soaring  and imagined its raptures and made them her own  returning home  she saluted each star  each peak  and each watch fire as if they signalled to her alone  and at last  when she flung herself upon her mat in the gipsies  tent  she could not help bursting out again  how good to eat  how good to eat   for it is a curious fact that though human beings have such imperfect means of communication  that they can only say  good to eat  when they mean  beautiful  and the other way about  they will yet endure ridicule and misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to themselves   all the young gipsies laughed  but rustum el sadi  the old man who had brought orlando out of constantinople on his donkey  sat silent  he had a nose like a scimitar  his cheeks were furrowed as if from the age long descent of iron hail  he was brown and keen eyed  and as he sat tugging at his hookah he observed orlando narrowly  he had the deepest suspicion that her god was nature  one day he found her in tears  interpreting this to mean that her god had punished her  he told her that he was not surprised  he showed her the fingers of his left hand  withered by the frost  he showed her his right foot  crushed where a rock had fallen  this  he said  was what her god did to men  when she said   but so beautiful   using the english word  he shook his head  and when she repeated it he was angry  he saw that she did not believe what he believed  and that was enough  wise and ancient as he was  to enrage him ,3546,643,11.1,2.6304770027269204,2.9614035087719297,2.6304770027269204,0.39434639200878774,8.1,1.8882852391500922,2.096551724137931,1.8882852391500922,0.25506353527772146,93.64006426488568,1.3773259082359097,1.3514402706778645,1.3773259082359097,0.3030698703540131,-0.07981666666666598,-0.2093028748534015,-0.1596138102362868,-0.2093028748534015,-0.17810674637763463,13.821000000000003,1.462023204255208,1.448767569769811,1.462023204255208,-0.13124240581494967,133.53215286233223,3.604707501732383,4.583477096485784,3.604707501732383,0.5526197384124718,3.497868656091832,2.041640239688456,1.9515444079866833,2.041640239688456,0.47727119849031446,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9036}",0.9036,1.0321652338587863,0.46114459017684817,1.0321652338587863,-0.06490550614346186,0.15221500721500722,0.2552139918190328,0.23070694625646465,0.2552139918190328,-0.15861834907019076,1.3756715683513379,2.5448796633108723,1.912160941008519,2.5448796633108723,0.1391342174894217,99.30905358382462,2.6444855441316255,2.086030996497599,2.6444855441316255,-0.5795277133719626,0.681,1.1297233601590049,0.8713642347398323,1.1297233601590049,0.35374610580009236

179,179,2,"'Oh! if only I could write!' she cried (for she had the odd conceit of those who write that words written are shared). She had no ink; and but little paper. But she made ink from berries and wine; and finding a few margins and blank spaces in the manuscript of 'The Oak Tree', managed by writing a kind of shorthand, to describe the scenery in a long, blank verse poem, and to carry on a dialogue with herself about this Beauty and Truth concisely enough. This kept her extremely happy for hours on end. But the gipsies became suspicious. First, they noticed that she was less adept than before at milking and cheese-making; next, she often hesitated before replying; and once a gipsy boy who had been asleep, woke in a terror feeling her eyes upon him. Sometimes this constraint would be felt by the whole tribe, numbering some dozens of grown men and women. It sprang from the sense they had (and their senses are very sharp and much in advance of their vocabulary) that whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in their hands. An old woman making a basket, a boy skinning a sheep, would be singing or crooning contentedly at their work, when Orlando would come into the camp, fling herself down by the fire and gaze into the flames. She need not even look at them, and yet they felt, here is someone who doubts; (we make a rough-and-ready translation from the gipsy language) here is someone who does not do the thing for the sake of doing; nor looks for looking's sake; here is someone who believes neither in sheep-skin nor basket; but sees (here they looked apprehensively about the tent) something else.

180,180,2,"Slowly, she began to feel that there was some difference between her and the gipsies which made her hesitate sometimes to marry and settle down among them for ever. At first she tried to account for it by saying that she came of an ancient and civilized race, whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people, not much better than savages. One night when they were questioning her about England she could not help with some pride describing the house where she was born, how it had     bedrooms and had been in the possession of her family for four or five hundred years. Her ancestors were earls, or even dukes, she added. At this she noticed again that the gipsies were uneasy; but not angry as before when she had praised the beauty of nature. Now they were courteous, but concerned as people of fine breeding are when a stranger has been made to reveal his low birth or poverty. Rustum followed her out of the tent alone and said that she need not mind if her father were a Duke, and possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she described. They would none of them think the worse of her for that. Then she was seized with a shame that she had never felt before. It was clear that Rustum and the other gipsies thought a descent of four or five hundred years only the meanest possible. Their own families went back at least two or three thousand years. To the gipsy whose ancestors had built the Pyramids centuries before Christ was born, the genealogy of Howards and Plantagenets was no better and no worse than that of the Smiths and the Joneses: both were negligible. Moreover, where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such antiquity, there was nothing specially memorable or desirable in ancient birth; vagabonds and beggars all shared it. And then, though he was too courteous to speak openly, it was clear that the gipsy thought that there was no more vulgar ambition than to possess bedrooms by the hundred (they were on top of a hill as they spoke; it was night; the mountains rose around them) when the whole earth is ours. Looked at from the gipsy point of view, a Duke, Orlando understood, was nothing but a profiteer or robber who snatched land and money from people who rated these things of little worth, and could think of nothing better to do than to build three hundred and sixty-five bedrooms when one was enough, and none was even better than one. She could not deny that her ancestors had accumulated field after field; house after house; honour after honour; yet had none of them been saints or heroes, or great benefactors of the human race. Nor could she counter the argument (Rustum was too much of a gentleman to press it, but she understood) that any man who did now what her ancestors had done three or four hundred years ago would be denounced--and by her own family most loudly--for a vulgar upstart, an adventurer, a nouveau riche.",slowly  she began to feel that there was some difference between her and the gipsies which made her hesitate sometimes to marry and settle down among them for ever  at first she tried to account for it by saying that she came of an ancient and civilized race  whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people  not much better than savages  one night when they were questioning her about england she could not help with some pride describing the house where she was born  how it had     bedrooms and had been in the possession of her family for four or five hundred years  her ancestors were earls  or even dukes  she added  at this she noticed again that the gipsies were uneasy  but not angry as before when she had praised the beauty of nature  now they were courteous  but concerned as people of fine breeding are when a stranger has been made to reveal his low birth or poverty  rustum followed her out of the tent alone and said that she need not mind if her father were a duke  and possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she described  they would none of them think the worse of her for that  then she was seized with a shame that she had never felt before  it was clear that rustum and the other gipsies thought a descent of four or five hundred years only the meanest possible  their own families went back at least two or three thousand years  to the gipsy whose ancestors had built the pyramids centuries before christ was born  the genealogy of howards and plantagenets was no better and no worse than that of the smiths and the joneses  both were negligible  moreover  where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such antiquity  there was nothing specially memorable or desirable in ancient birth  vagabonds and beggars all shared it  and then  though he was too courteous to speak openly  it was clear that the gipsy thought that there was no more vulgar ambition than to possess bedrooms by the hundred  they were on top of a hill as they spoke  it was night  the mountains rose around them  when the whole earth is ours  looked at from the gipsy point of view  a duke  orlando understood  was nothing but a profiteer or robber who snatched land and money from people who rated these things of little worth  and could think of nothing better to do than to build three hundred and sixty five bedrooms when one was enough  and none was even better than one  she could not deny that her ancestors had accumulated field after field  house after house  honour after honour  yet had none of them been saints or heroes  or great benefactors of the human race  nor could she counter the argument  rustum was too much of a gentleman to press it  but she understood  that any man who did now what her ancestors had done three or four hundred years ago would be denounced  and by her own family most loudly  for a vulgar upstart  an adventurer  a nouveau riche ,2864,515,5.499999999999999,1.1923903669353164,1.3894736842105262,1.1923903669353164,0.1755649521145138,4.5,0.9474975306975308,1.103448275862069,0.9474975306975308,0.13432203370496554,55.172602199857785,0.823301381304486,0.7962668227144556,0.823301381304486,0.22295040818675055,4.671392857142859,1.863276332199272,2.139720128799057,1.863276332199272,0.3821891225680037,13.455,1.4023393734948706,1.399062945610104,1.4023393734948706,-0.017982111951219456,18.461566588718473,0.1292939874343269,0.3658327966687402,0.1292939874343269,-0.17681717705492586,1.8897711474745995,0.9862750076706467,1.0543484269501426,0.9862750076706467,0.3219398128106834,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9444}",0.9444,1.0941238985823107,0.49328449328449336,1.0941238985823107,-0.004588969764794691,0.12679539295392953,0.08517246793671654,0.0928410617254503,0.08517246793671654,-0.15142330942920332,1.0632236887013042,1.7644556007436585,1.3670551667460693,1.7644556007436585,0.11534819432767117,80.31527376767048,1.8940614420694581,1.5373459882522298,1.8940614420694581,-0.5619166400290864,-0.9959,-0.8020366539535124,-0.05811681563084604,-0.8020366539535124,0.10967620928765812
181,181,2,"She sought to answer such arguments by the familiar if oblique method of finding the gipsy life itself rude and barbarous; and so, in a short time, much bad blood was bred between them. Indeed, such differences of opinion are enough to cause bloodshed and revolution. Towns have been sacked for less, and a million martyrs have suffered at the stake rather than yield an inch upon any of the points here debated. No passion is stronger in the breast of man than the desire to make others believe as he believes. Nothing so cuts at the root of his happiness and fills him with rage as the sense that another rates low what he prizes high. Whigs and Tories, Liberal party and Labour party--for what do they battle except their own prestige? It is not love of truth but desire to prevail that sets quarter against quarter and makes parish desire the downfall of parish.

184,184,2,"What was to be done, Orlando could not think. To leave the gipsies and become once more an Ambassador seemed to her intolerable. But it was equally impossible to remain for ever where there was neither ink nor writing paper, neither reverence for the Talbots nor respect for a multiplicity of bedrooms. So she was thinking, one fine morning on the slopes of Mount Athos, when minding her goats. And then Nature, in whom she trusted, either played her a trick or worked a miracle--again, opinions differ too much for it to be possible to say which.

185,185,2,"Suddenly a shadow, though there was nothing to cast a shadow, appeared on the bald mountain-side opposite. It deepened quickly and soon a green hollow showed where there had been barren rock before. As she looked, the hollow deepened and widened, and a great park-like space opened in the flank of the hill. Within, she could see an undulating and grassy lawn; she could see oak trees dotted here and there; she could see the thrushes hopping among the branches. She could see the deer stepping delicately from shade to shade, and could even hear the hum of insects and the gentle sighs and shivers of a summer's day in England. After she had gazed entranced for some time, snow began falling; soon the whole landscape was covered and marked with violet shades instead of yellow sunlight. Now she saw heavy carts coming along the roads, laden with tree trunks, which they were taking, she knew, to be sawn for firewood; and then appeared the roofs and belfries and towers and courtyards of her own home. The snow was falling steadily, and she could now hear the slither and flop which it made as it slid down the roof and fell to the ground. The smoke went up from a thousand chimneys. All was so clear and minute that she could see a Daw pecking for worms in the snow. Then, gradually, the violet shadows deepened and closed over the carts and the lawns and the great house itself. All was swallowed up. Now there was nothing left of the grassy hollow, and instead of the green lawns was only the blazing hill-side which a thousand vultures seemed to have picked bare. At this, she burst into a passion of tears, and striding back to the gipsies' camp, told them that she must sail for England the very next day.",suddenly a shadow  though there was nothing to cast a shadow  appeared on the bald mountain side opposite  it deepened quickly and soon a green hollow showed where there had been barren rock before  as she looked  the hollow deepened and widened  and a great park like space opened in the flank of the hill  within  she could see an undulating and grassy lawn  she could see oak trees dotted here and there  she could see the thrushes hopping among the branches  she could see the deer stepping delicately from shade to shade  and could even hear the hum of insects and the gentle sighs and shivers of a summer own day in england  after she had gazed entranced for some time  snow began falling  soon the whole landscape was covered and marked with violet shades instead of yellow sunlight  now she saw heavy carts coming along the roads  laden with tree trunks  which they were taking  she knew  to be sawn for firewood  and then appeared the roofs and belfries and towers and courtyards of her own home  the snow was falling steadily  and she could now hear the slither and flop which it made as it slid down the roof and fell to the ground  the smoke went up from a thousand chimneys  all was so clear and minute that she could see a daw pecking for worms in the snow  then  gradually  the violet shadows deepened and closed over the carts and the lawns and the great house itself  all was swallowed up  now there was nothing left of the grassy hollow  and instead of the green lawns was only the blazing hill side which a thousand vultures seemed to have picked bare  at this  she burst into a passion of tears  and striding back to the gipsies  camp  told them that she must sail for england the very next day ,1713,310,-2.3,-0.8106588757744178,-0.7999999999999999,-0.8106588757744178,-0.4259216535075731,-2.3,-0.8295459186017518,-0.7724137931034483,-0.8295459186017518,-0.3711655937026575,-14.816147201501735,-0.1847059499840082,-0.21383088682809798,-0.1847059499840082,-0.0994639319172237,5.543154761904764,2.2435575191803645,2.561606750370306,2.2435575191803645,0.9190660724471884,9.319999999999997,0.7280425423637416,0.8375093365926527,0.7280425423637416,0.07832323175110277,-12.698902121430947,-0.8118284798624936,-0.7762816001632256,-0.8118284798624936,-0.5029056070578751,0.17095791006162445,-0.14175094932335633,0.09538149833064928,-0.14175094932335633,0.04838382608153738,"{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.9345}",0.9345,1.0790898108185145,0.48548584032455006,1.0790898108185145,0.16161346724527445,0.09238683127572014,-0.14499956387574958,-0.09377730086984357,-0.14499956387574958,-0.11208860603708734,0.4678347963122249,0.27730894855280286,0.32832216738459835,0.27730894855280286,-0.06091160761314229,52.99695211910358,0.8147435184439654,0.748184816327653,0.8147435184439654,-0.38638692529399205,-0.5189,-0.25254084219868456,0.20627728123051334,-0.25254084219868456,0.13087232860512013

Birds sang; the torrents rushed. It recalled the feeling of indescribable pleasure with which she had first seen Sasha, hundreds of years ago. Then she had pursued, now she fled. Which is the greater ecstasy? The man's or the woman's? And are they not perhaps the same? No, she thought, this is the most delicious (thanking the Captain but refusing), to refuse, and see him frown. Well, she would, if he wished it, have the very thinnest, smallest shiver in the world. This was the most delicious of all, to yield and see him smile.

193,193,3,"'But what used we young fellows in the cockpit of the ""Marie Rose"" to say about a woman who threw herself overboard for the pleasure of being rescued by a blue-jacket?' she said. 'We had a word for them. Ah! I have it...' (But we must omit that word; it was disrespectful in the extreme and passing strange on a lady's lips.) 'Lord! Lord! she cried again at the conclusion of her thoughts, 'must I then begin to respect the opinion of the other sex, however monstrous I think it? If I wear skirts, if I can't swim, if I have to be rescued by a blue-jacket, by God!' she cried, 'I must!' Upon which a gloom fell over her. Candid by nature, and averse to all kinds of equivocation, to tell lies bored her. It seemed to her a roundabout way of going to work. Yet, she reflected, the flowered paduasoy--the pleasure of being rescued by a blue-jacket--if these were only to be obtained by roundabout ways, roundabout one must go, she supposed. She remembered how, as a young man, she had insisted that women must be obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled. 'Now I shall have to pay in my own person for those desires,' she reflected; 'for women are not (judging by my own short experience of the sex) obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled by nature. They can only attain these graces, without which they may enjoy none of the delights of life, by the most tedious discipline. There's the hairdressing,' she thought, 'that alone will take an hour of my morning, there's looking in the looking-glass, another hour; there's staying and lacing; there's washing and powdering; there's changing from silk to lace and from lace to paduasoy; there's being chaste year in year out...' Here she tossed her foot impatiently, and showed an inch or two of calf. A sailor on the mast, who happened to look down at the moment, started so violently that he missed his footing and only saved himself by the skin of his teeth. 'If the sight of my ankles means death to an honest fellow who, no doubt, has a wife and family to support, I must, in all humanity, keep them covered,' Orlando thought. Yet her legs were among her chiefest beauties. And she fell to thinking what an odd pass we have come to when all a woman's beauty has to be kept covered lest a sailor may fall from a mast-head. 'A pox on them!' she said, realizing for the first time what, in other circumstances, she would have been taught as a child, that is to say, the sacred responsibilities of womanhood.", but what used we young fellows in the cockpit of the  marie rose  to say about a woman who threw herself overboard for the pleasure of being rescued by a blue jacket   she said   we had a word for them  ah  i have it      but we must omit that word  it was disrespectful in the extreme and passing strange on a lady own lips    lord  lord  she cried again at the conclusion of her thoughts   must i then begin to respect the opinion of the other sex  however monstrous i think it  if i wear skirts  if i cannot swim  if i have to be rescued by a blue jacket  by god   she cried   i must   upon which a gloom fell over her  candid by nature  and averse to all kinds of equivocation  to tell lies bored her  it seemed to her a roundabout way of going to work  yet  she reflected  the flowered paduasoy  the pleasure of being rescued by a blue jacket  if these were only to be obtained by roundabout ways  roundabout one must go  she supposed  she remembered how  as a young man  she had insisted that women must be obedient  chaste  scented  and exquisitely apparelled   now i shall have to pay in my own person for those desires   she reflected   for women are not  judging by my own short experience of the sex  obedient  chaste  scented  and exquisitely apparelled by nature  they can only attain these graces  without which they may enjoy none of the delights of life  by the most tedious discipline  there is the hairdressing   she thought   that alone will take an hour of my morning  there is looking in the looking glass  another hour  there is staying and lacing  there is washing and powdering  there is changing from silk to lace and from lace to paduasoy  there is being chaste year in year out     here she tossed her foot impatiently  and showed an inch or two of calf  a sailor on the mast  who happened to look down at the moment  started so violently that he missed his footing and only saved himself by the skin of his teeth   if the sight of my ankles means death to an honest fellow who  no doubt  has a wife and family to support  i must  in all humanity  keep them covered   orlando thought  yet her legs were among her chiefest beauties  and she fell to thinking what an odd pass we have come to when all a woman own beauty has to be kept covered lest a sailor may fall from a mast head   a pox on them   she said  realizing for the first time what  in other circumstances  she would have been taught as a child  that is to say  the sacred responsibilities of womanhood ,2481,447,4.75,0.9997894782132268,1.1789473684210527,0.9997894782132268,0.17379649911830347,4.75,1.012830010451181,1.1724137931034482,1.012830010451181,0.1934058799360206,-70.07153710071591,-0.9805172566299616,-1.0112925253695753,-0.9805172566299616,-0.3262316962599265,-7.7347222222222225,-3.5485363914749857,-3.8641829427477163,-3.5485363914749857,-1.2249597677466244,17.894000000000005,2.1262096596837656,2.001901269776602,2.1262096596837656,0.32204662649298055,49.57991898022527,1.0691444387649212,1.5064035179446436,1.0691444387649212,0.14187358916973394,1.76407433683073,0.9037824703598129,0.9842191762458347,0.9037824703598129,0.346243844385629,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.7295}",0.7295,0.7677778924772772,0.32399858206309823,0.7677778924772772,-0.03299418341569776,0.14912698412698408,0.23455702408230172,0.21395873638553897,0.23455702408230172,-0.0850680704425995,0.8493026331914169,1.2301292375861008,0.9938421920721187,1.2301292375861008,0.06313805142039669,75.05334451243469,1.6861681962439683,1.3853413991319488,1.6861681962439683,-0.42210290647819726,-0.9975,-0.8038798264877005,-0.059003672140234276,-0.8038798264877005,0.0853940908967077
194,194,3,"'And that's the last oath I shall ever be able to swear,' she thought; 'once I set foot on English soil. And I shall never be able to crack a man over the head, or tell him he lies in his teeth, or draw my sword and run him through the body, or sit among my peers, or wear a coronet, or walk in procession, or sentence a man to death, or lead an army, or prance down Whitehall on a charger, or wear seventy-two different medals on my breast. All I can do, once I set foot on English soil, is to pour out tea and ask my lords how they like it. D'you take sugar? D'you take cream?' And mincing out the words, she was horrified to perceive how low an opinion she was forming of the other sex, the manly, to which it had once been her pride to belong--'To fall from a mast-head', she thought, 'because you see a woman's ankles; to dress up like a Guy Fawkes and parade the streets, so that women may praise you; to deny a woman teaching lest she may laugh at you; to be the slave of the frailest chit in petticoats. and yet to go about as if you were the Lords of creation.--Heavens!' she thought, 'what fools they make of us--what fools we are!' And here it would seem from some ambiguity in her terms that she was censuring both sexes equally, as if she belonged to neither; and indeed, for the time being, she seemed to vacillate; she was man; she was woman; she knew the secrets, shared the weaknesses of each. It was a most bewildering and whirligig state of mind to be in. The comforts of ignorance seemed utterly denied her. She was a feather blown on the gale. Thus it is no great wonder, as she pitted one sex against the other, and found each alternately full of the most deplorable infirmities, and was not sure to which she belonged--it was no great wonder that she was about to cry out that she would return to Turkey and become a gipsy again when the anchor fell with a great splash into the sea; the sails came tumbling on deck, and she perceived (so sunk had she been in thought that she had seen nothing for several days) that the ship was anchored off the coast of Italy. The Captain at once sent to ask the honour of her company ashore with him in the longboat.", and that is the last oath i shall ever be able to swear   she thought   once i set foot on english soil  and i shall never be able to crack a man over the head  or tell him he lies in his teeth  or draw my sword and run him through the body  or sit among my peers  or wear a coronet  or walk in procession  or sentence a man to death  or lead an army  or prance down whitehall on a charger  or wear seventy two different medals on my breast  all i can do  once i set foot on english soil  is to pour out tea and ask my lords how they like it  d you take sugar  d you take cream   and mincing out the words  she was horrified to perceive how low an opinion she was forming of the other sex  the manly  to which it had once been her pride to belong   to fall from a mast head   she thought   because you see a woman own ankles  to dress up like a guy fawkes and parade the streets  so that women may praise you  to deny a woman teaching lest she may laugh at you  to be the slave of the frailest chit in petticoats  and yet to go about as if you were the lords of creation   heavens   she thought   what fools they make of us  what fools we are   and here it would seem from some ambiguity in her terms that she was censuring both sexes equally  as if she belonged to neither  and indeed  for the time being  she seemed to vacillate  she was man  she was woman  she knew the secrets  shared the weaknesses of each  it was a most bewildering and whirligig state of mind to be in  the comforts of ignorance seemed utterly denied her  she was a feather blown on the gale  thus it is no great wonder  as she pitted one sex against the other  and found each alternately full of the most deplorable infirmities  and was not sure to which she belonged  it was no great wonder that she was about to cry out that she would return to turkey and become a gipsy again when the anchor fell with a great splash into the sea  the sails came tumbling on deck  and she perceived  so sunk had she been in thought that she had seen nothing for several days  that the ship was anchored off the coast of italy  the captain at once sent to ask the honour of her company ashore with him in the longboat ,2176,422,-1.549999999999999,-0.6180579870523276,-0.5894736842105259,-0.6180579870523276,-0.3014178146458969,-2.5499999999999994,-0.8948783983554017,-0.8413793103448274,-0.8948783983554017,-0.3280947391306555,-99.03195432434185,-1.397617335260906,-1.4292575748266962,-1.397617335260906,-0.488376695186202,0.8361111111111114,0.19024441050018098,0.28364675627753294,0.19024441050018098,-0.049809411466752586,3.905999999999999,-0.15482155527686975,0.10226115298431443,-0.15482155527686975,-0.4305200025590099,24.89354030382701,0.3235553455884038,0.6015818108572696,0.3235553455884038,-0.07857393453953342,-0.8105796087625803,-0.7859162227207527,-0.4522417100921347,-0.7859162227207527,-0.1685217364841521,"{'neg': 0.086, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.6422}",0.6422,0.6352045731056186,0.25522864232541653,0.6352045731056186,-0.04850481503670897,0.07268518518518519,-0.27679141129785173,-0.20063119869423357,-0.27679141129785173,-0.20757021836448955,0.8052158200160371,1.1200103598951736,0.9169270391907899,1.1200103598951736,0.06570512995001451,70.35831004059197,1.5006723622506222,1.2497130485440182,1.5006723622506222,-0.4358908297966598,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,0.07414934453901216

196,196,3,"'Ignorant and poor as we are compared with the other sex,' she thought, continuing the sentence which she had left unfinished the other day, 'armoured with every weapon as they are, while they debar us even from a knowledge of the alphabet' (and from these opening words it is plain that something had happened during the night to give her a push towards the female sex, for she was speaking more as a woman speaks than as a man, yet with a sort of content after all), 'still--they fall from the mast-head.' Here she gave a great yawn and fell asleep. When she woke, the ship was sailing before a fair breeze so near the shore that towns on the cliffs' edge seemed only kept from slipping into the water by the interposition of some great rock or the twisted roots of some ancient olive tree. The scent of oranges wafted from a million trees, heavy with the fruit, reached her on deck. A score of blue dolphins, twisting their tails, leapt high now and again into the air. Stretching her arms out (arms, she had learnt already, have no such fatal effects as legs), she thanked Heaven that she was not prancing down Whitehall on a warhorse, nor even sentencing a man to death. 'Better is it', she thought, 'to be clothed with poverty and ignorance, which are the dark garments of the female sex; better to leave the rule and discipline of the world to others; better be quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all the other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the humane spirit, which are', she said aloud, as her habit was when deeply moved, 'contemplation, solitude, love.'", ignorant and poor as we are compared with the other sex   she thought  continuing the sentence which she had left unfinished the other day   armoured with every weapon as they are  while they debar us even from a knowledge of the alphabet   and from these opening words it is plain that something had happened during the night to give her a push towards the female sex  for she was speaking more as a woman speaks than as a man  yet with a sort of content after all    owntill  they fall from the mast head   here she gave a great yawn and fell asleep  when she woke  the ship was sailing before a fair breeze so near the shore that towns on the cliffs  edge seemed only kept from slipping into the water by the interposition of some great rock or the twisted roots of some ancient olive tree  the scent of oranges wafted from a million trees  heavy with the fruit  reached her on deck  a score of blue dolphins  twisting their tails  leapt high now and again into the air  stretching her arms out  arms  she had learnt already  have no such fatal effects as legs   she thanked heaven that she was not prancing down whitehall on a warhorse  nor even sentencing a man to death   better is it   she thought   to be clothed with poverty and ignorance  which are the dark garments of the female sex  better to leave the rule and discipline of the world to others  better be quit of martial ambition  the love of power  and all the other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the humane spirit  which are   she said aloud  as her habit was when deeply moved   contemplation  solitude  love  ,1627,295,5.0,1.0639897744539235,1.249122807017544,1.0639897744539235,0.3839218697385961,5.0,1.078162490204831,1.2413793103448276,1.078162490204831,0.3912167843092582,14.939348920210435,0.24384518849696604,0.21560896937627602,0.24384518849696604,0.10539055406866683,0.35069444444444464,-0.02150472096802848,0.04873078158796486,-0.02150472096802848,-0.09810202135764859,14.198999999999993,1.5236638819257182,1.5001018537380313,1.5236638819257182,0.520141709457846,38.23182367924466,0.7264041690943398,1.0904655184096879,0.7264041690943398,0.22118552470470693,2.071203796190663,1.1053459647374737,1.1555740319800503,1.1053459647374737,0.6159897983103935,"{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9657}",0.9657,1.126469966195327,0.5100634132892198,1.126469966195327,0.19807702803512747,0.1520362103174603,0.25401795097387886,0.22973722294837146,0.25401795097387886,0.0529060496888499,0.8529781223527094,1.2393097773496946,1.0002545587276508,1.2393097773496946,0.3777980933104051,53.16089743556035,0.8212208240713967,0.7529208055926947,0.8212208240713967,-0.2782036095828123,-0.9967,-0.8029582402206064,-0.05856024388554015,-0.8029582402206064,-0.00815201729166566
197,197,3,"'Praise God that I'm a woman!' she cried, and was about to run into extreme folly--than which none is more distressing in woman or man either--of being proud of her sex, when she paused over the singular word, which, for all we can do to put it in its place, has crept in at the end of the last sentence: Love. 'Love,' said Orlando. Instantly--such is its impetuosity--love took a human shape--such is its pride. For where other thoughts are content to remain abstract, nothing will satisfy this one but to put on flesh and blood, mantilla and petticoats, hose and jerkin. And as all Orlando's loves had been women, now, through the culpable laggardry of the human frame to adapt itself to convention, though she herself was a woman, it was still a woman she loved; and if the consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it was to quicken and deepen those feelings which she had had as a man. For now a thousand hints and mysteries became plain to her that were then dark. Now, the obscurity, which divides the sexes and lets linger innumerable impurities in its gloom, was removed, and if there is anything in what the poet says about truth and beauty, this affection gained in beauty what it lost in falsity.

Not one of these words so coupled together seemed to her wrong; nevertheless, as the chalky cliffs loomed nearer, she felt culpable; dishonoured; unchaste, which, for one who had never given the matter a thought, was strange. Closer and closer they drew, till the samphire gatherers, hanging half-way down the cliff, were plain to the naked eye.

202,202,3,"Among the hurry of these thoughts, however, there now rose, like a dome of smooth, white marble, something which, whether fact or fancy, was so impressive to her fevered imagination that she settled upon it as one has seen a swarm of vibrant dragonflies alight, with apparent satisfaction, upon the glass bell which shelters some tender vegetable. The form of it, by the hazard of fancy, recalled that earliest, most persistent memory--the man with the big forehead in Twitchett's sitting-room, the man who sat writing, or rather looking, but certainly not at her, for he never seemed to see her poised there in all her finery, lovely boy though she must have been, she could not deny it--and whenever she thought of him, the thought spread round it, like the risen moon on turbulent waters, a sheet of silver calm. Now her hand went to her bosom (the other was still in the Captain's keeping), where the pages of her poem were hidden safe. It might have been a talisman that she kept there. The distraction of sex, which hers was, and what it meant, subsided; she thought now only of the glory of poetry, and the great lines of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Milton began booming and reverberating, as if a golden clapper beat against a golden bell in the cathedral tower which was her mind. The truth was that the image of the marble dome which her eyes had first discovered so faintly that it suggested a poet's forehead and thus started a flock of irrelevant ideas, was no figment, but a reality; and as the ship advanced down the Thames before a favouring gale, the image with all its associations gave place to the truth, and revealed itself as nothing more and nothing less than the dome of a vast cathedral rising among a fretwork of white spires.",among the hurry of these thoughts  however  there now rose  like a dome of smooth  white marble  something which  whether fact or fancy  was so impressive to her fevered imagination that she settled upon it as one has seen a swarm of vibrant dragonflies alight  with apparent satisfaction  upon the glass bell which shelters some tender vegetable  the form of it  by the hazard of fancy  recalled that earliest  most persistent memory  the man with the big forehead in twitchett own sitting room  the man who sat writing  or rather looking  but certainly not at her  for he never seemed to see her poised there in all her finery  lovely boy though she must have been  she could not deny it  and whenever she thought of him  the thought spread round it  like the risen moon on turbulent waters  a sheet of silver calm  now her hand went to her bosom  the other was still in the captain own keeping   where the pages of her poem were hidden safe  it might have been a talisman that she kept there  the distraction of sex  which hers was  and what it meant  subsided  she thought now only of the glory of poetry  and the great lines of marlowe  shakespeare  ben jonson  milton began booming and reverberating  as if a golden clapper beat against a golden bell in the cathedral tower which was her mind  the truth was that the image of the marble dome which her eyes had first discovered so faintly that it suggested a poet own forehead and thus started a flock of irrelevant ideas  was no figment  but a reality  and as the ship advanced down the thames before a favouring gale  the image with all its associations gave place to the truth  and revealed itself as nothing more and nothing less than the dome of a vast cathedral rising among a fretwork of white spires ,1758,311,10.049999999999999,2.3608357585159947,2.666666666666666,2.3608357585159947,0.8945819191249061,10.049999999999999,2.397878581228563,2.634482758620689,2.397878581228563,0.8719494340516157,192.33893959288122,2.7988285178912844,2.775890753876494,2.7988285178912844,1.2870602018302701,2.640773809523809,0.977476875355729,1.1570079857028204,0.977476875355729,0.34688077017172125,14.86099999999999,1.6316166031370372,1.5900047531744406,1.6316166031370372,0.5116407509738727,88.83867797949651,2.254855105574343,2.945341881545695,2.254855105574343,0.8836856692769611,3.2429285783069646,1.874327689982798,1.809307253853905,1.874327689982798,0.9148495886878039,"{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9942}",0.9942,1.169749915818377,0.5325140809011777,1.169749915818377,0.18727002340251062,0.20792370711725544,0.6278707964262369,0.5328487926752886,0.6278707964262369,0.16919141618035238,1.1730245646937658,2.038713329141293,1.5586170092831548,2.038713329141293,0.657193490960146,55.300466282708236,0.9057529207084019,0.8147278477876575,0.9057529207084019,-0.306177008724466,-0.7756,-0.548254835652488,0.06399224000554282,-0.548254835652488,0.06399967355566123
203,203,3,"'St Paul's,' said Captain Bartolus, who stood by her side. 'The Tower of London,' he continued. 'Greenwich Hospital, erected in memory of Queen Mary by her husband, his late majesty, William the Third. Westminster Abbey. The Houses of Parliament.' As he spoke, each of these famous buildings rose to view. It was a fine September morning. A myriad of little water-craft plied from bank to bank. Rarely has a gayer, or more interesting, spectacle presented itself to the gaze of a returned traveller. Orlando hung over the prow, absorbed in wonder. Her eyes had been used too long to savages and nature not to be entranced by these urban glories. That, then, was the dome of St Paul's which Mr Wren had built during her absence. Near by, a shock of golden hair burst from a pillar--Captain Bartolus was at her side to inform her that that was the Monument; there had been a plague and a fire during her absence, he said. Do what she could to restrain them, the tears came to her eyes, until, remembering that it is becoming in a woman to weep, she let them flow. Here, she thought, had been the great carnival. Here, where the waves slapped briskly, had stood the Royal Pavilion. Here she had first met Sasha. About here (she looked down into the sparkling waters) one had been used to see the frozen bumboat woman with her apples on her lap. All that splendour and corruption was gone. Gone, too, was the dark night, the monstrous downpour, the violent surges of the flood. Here, where yellow icebergs had raced circling with a crew of terror-stricken wretches on top, a covey of swans floated, orgulous, undulant, superb. London itself had completely changed since she had last seen it. Then, she remembered, it had been a huddle of little black, beetle-browed houses. The heads of rebels had grinned on pikes at Temple Bar. The cobbled pavements had reeked of garbage and ordure. Now, as the ship sailed past Wapping, she caught glimpses of broad and orderly thoroughfares. Stately coaches drawn by teams of well-fed horses stood at the doors of houses whose bow windows, whose plate glass, whose polished knockers, testified to the wealth and modest dignity of the dwellers within. Ladies in flowered silk (she put the Captain's glass to her eye) walked on raised footpaths. Citizens in broidered coats took snuff at street corners under lamp-posts. She caught sight of a variety of painted signs swinging in the breeze and could form a rapid notion from what was painted on them of the tobacco, of the stuff, of the silk, of the gold, of the silver ware, of the gloves, of the perfumes, and of a thousand other articles which were sold within. Nor could she do more as the ship sailed to its anchorage by London Bridge than glance at coffee-house windows where, on balconies, since the weather was fine, a great number of decent citizens sat at ease, with china dishes in front of them, clay pipes by their sides, while one among them read from a news sheet, and was frequently interrupted by the laughter or the comments of the others. Were these taverns, were these wits, were these poets? she asked of Captain Bartolus, who obligingly informed her that even now--if she turned her head a little to the left and looked along the line of his first finger--so--they were passing the Cocoa Tree, where,--yes, there he was--one might see Mr Addison taking his coffee; the other two gentlemen--'there, Ma'am, a little to the right of the lamp-post, one of 'em humped, t'other much the same as you or me'--were Mr Dryden and Mr Pope.' 'Sad dogs,' said the Captain, by which he meant that they were Papists, 'but men of parts, none the less,' he added, hurrying aft to superintend the arrangements for landing. (The Captain must have been mistaken, as a reference to any textbook of literature will show; but the mistake was a kindly one, and so we let it stand.)", ownt paul own   said captain bartolus  who

No sooner had she returned to her home in Blackfriars than she was made aware by a succession of Bow Street runners and other grave emissaries from the Law Courts that she was a party to three major suits which had been preferred against her during her absence, as well as innumerable minor litigations, some arising out of, others depending on them. The chief charges against her were ( ) that she was dead, and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; ( ) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same thing; ( ) that she was an English Duke who had married one Rosina Pepita, a dancer; and had had by her three sons, which sons now declaring that their father was deceased, claimed that all his property descended to them. Such grave charges as these would, of course, take time and money to dispose of. All her estates were put in Chancery and her titles pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation. Thus it was in a highly ambiguous condition, uncertain whether she was alive or dead, man or woman, Duke or nonentity, that she posted down to her country seat, where, pending the legal judgment, she had the Law's permission to reside in a state of incognito or incognita, as the case might turn out to be.",but now orlando was to learn how little the most tempestuous flutter of excitement avails against the iron countenance of the law  how harder than the stones of london bridge it is  and than the lips of a cannon more severe  no sooner had she returned to her home in blackfriars than she was made aware by a succession of bow street runners and other grave emissaries from the law courts that she was a party to three major suits which had been preferred against her during her absence  as well as innumerable minor litigations  some arising out of  others depending on them  the chief charges against her were     that she was dead  and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever      that she was a woman  which amounts to much the same thing      that she was an english duke who had married one rosina pepita  a dancer  and had had by her three sons  which sons now declaring that their father was deceased  claimed that all his property descended to them  such grave charges as these would  of course  take time and money to dispose of  all her estates were put in chancery and her titles pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation  thus it was in a highly ambiguous condition  uncertain whether she was alive or dead  man or woman  duke or nonentity  that she posted down to her country seat  where  pending the legal judgment  she had the law own permission to reside in a state of incognito or incognita  as the case might turn out to be ,1468,267,-0.34999999999999987,-0.30989656509698416,-0.2526315789473684,-0.30989656509698416,-0.22291685916527668,-1.0999999999999999,-0.5159500157842313,-0.4413793103448275,-0.5159500157842313,-0.26793874590721733,-30.44907280449101,-0.4098579030062563,-0.43944975386163115,-0.4098579030062563,-0.23733120499680396,1.9285166666666669,0.6667750768004778,0.8123132266767756,0.6667750768004778,0.26959386910827393,2.6340000000000003,-0.36224732775541735,-0.07048278671827246,-0.36224732775541735,-0.41562183570182865,6.423290541639889,-0.23429143102687328,-0.07540217043968384,-0.23429143102687328,-0.22687093228568775,-2.4698569380725943,-1.874869842911933,-1.377992134618373,-1.874869842911933,-0.8115835563829259,"{'neg': 0.124, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.9666}",-0.9666,-1.8079106182474667,-1.0120918508015282,-1.8079106182474667,-0.7723090706818297,0.08533068783068783,-0.1922008066563174,-0.13204701839725094,-0.1922008066563174,-0.09571586503102421,0.3212323016687583,-0.08887089104250184,0.07255513692517154,-0.08887089104250184,-0.15803703300074473,45.69235335434299,0.5261465660718078,0.5371723758199951,0.5261465660718078,-0.384345741284336,-0.998,-0.8044558179046343,-0.059280814799418054,-0.8044558179046343,-0.03744346473246421
206,206,3,"It was a fine evening in December when she arrived and the snow was falling and the violet shadows were slanting much as she had seen them from the hill-top at Broussa. The great house lay more like a town than a house, brown and blue, rose and purple in the snow, with all its chimneys smoking busily as if inspired with a life of their own. She could not restrain a cry as she saw it there tranquil and massive, couched upon the meadows. As the yellow coach entered the park and came bowling along the drive between the trees, the red deer raised their heads as if expectantly, and it was observed that instead of showing the timidity natural to their kind, they followed the coach and stood about the courtyard when it drew up. Some tossed their antlers, others pawed the ground as the step was let down and Orlando alighted. One, it is said, actually knelt in the snow before her. She had not time to reach her hand towards the knocker before both wings of the great door were flung open, and there, with lights and torches held above their heads, were Mrs Grimsditch, Mr Dupper, and a whole retinue of servants come to greet her. But the orderly procession was interrupted first by the impetuosity of Canute, the elk-hound, who threw himself with such ardour upon his mistress that he almost knocked her to the ground; next, by the agitation of Mrs Grimsditch, who, making as if to curtsey, was overcome with emotion and could do no more than gasp Milord!

210,210,3,"It was a little book bound in velvet, stitched with gold, which had been held by Mary Queen of Scots on the scaffold, and the eye of faith could detect a brownish stain, said to be made of a drop of the Royal blood. But what pious thoughts it roused in Orlando, what evil passions it soothed asleep, who dare say, seeing that of all communions this with the deity is the most inscrutable? Novelist, poet, historian all falter with their hand on that door; nor does the believer himself enlighten us, for is he more ready to die than other people, or more eager to share his goods? Does he not keep as many maids and carriage horses as the rest? and yet with it all, holds a faith he says which should make goods a vanity and death desirable. In the Queen's prayerbook, along with the blood-stain, was also a lock of hair and a crumb of pastry; Orlando now added to these keepsakes a flake of tobacco, and so, reading and smoking, was moved by the humane jumble of them all--the hair, the pastry, the blood-stain, the tobacco--to such a mood of contemplation as gave her a reverent air suitable in the circumstances, though she had, it is said, no traffic with the usual God. Nothing, however, can be more arrogant, though nothing is commoner than to assume that of Gods there is only one, and of religions none but the speaker's. Orlando, it seemed, had a faith of her own. With all the religious ardour in the world, she now reflected upon her sins and the imperfections that had crept into her spiritual state. The letter S, she reflected, is the serpent in the poet's Eden. Do what she would there were still too many of these sinful reptiles in the first stanzas of 'The Oak Tree'. But 'S' was nothing, in her opinion, compared with the termination 'ing'. The present participle is the Devil himself, she thought, now that we are in the place for believing in Devils. To evade such temptations is the first duty of the poet, she concluded, for as the ear is the antechamber to the soul, poetry can adulterate and destroy more surely than lust or gunpowder. The poet's, then, is the highest office of all, she continued. His words reach where others fall short. A silly song of Shakespeare's has done more for the poor and the wicked than all the preachers and philanthropists in the world. No time, no devotion, can be too great, therefore, which makes the vehicle of our message less distorting. We must shape our words till they are the thinnest integument for our thoughts.

214,214,3,"How she had loved sound when she was a boy, and thought the volley of tumultuous syllables from the lips the finest of all poetry. Then--it was the effect of Sasha and her disillusionment perhaps--into this high frenzy was let fall some black drop, which turned her rhapsody into sluggishness. Slowly there had opened within her something intricate and many-chambered, which one must take a torch to explore, in prose not verse; and she remembered how passionately she had studied that doctor at Norwich, Browne, whose book was at her hand there. She had formed here in solitude after her affair with Greene, or tried to form, for Heaven knows these growths are agelong in coming, a spirit capable of resistance. 'I will write,' she had said, 'what I enjoy writing'; and so had scratched out twenty-six volumes. Yet still, for all her travels and adventures and profound thinkings and turnings this way and that, she was only in process of fabrication. What the future might bring, Heaven only knew. Change was incessant, and change perhaps would never cease. High battlements of thought, habits that had seemed durable as stone, went down like shadows at the touch of another mind and left a naked sky and fresh stars twinkling in it. Here she went to the window, and in spite of the cold could not help unlatching it. She leant out into the damp night air. She heard a fox bark in the woods, and the clutter of a pheasant trailing through the branches. She heard the snow slither and flop from the roof to the ground. 'By my life,' she exclaimed, 'this is a thousand times better than Turkey. Rustum,' she cried, as if she were arguing with the gipsy (and in this new power of bearing an argument in mind and continuing it with someone who was not there to contradict she showed again the development of her soul), 'you were wrong. This is better than Turkey. Hair, pastry, tobacco--of what odds and ends are we compounded,' she said (thinking of Queen Mary's prayer-book).

It is true that each visit began, continued, or concluded with a declaration of love, but in between there was much room for silence. They sat on either side of the fireplace and sometimes the Archduke knocked over the fire-irons and Orlando picked them up again. Then the Archduke would bethink him how he had shot an elk in Sweden, and Orlando would ask, was it a very big elk, and the Archduke would say that it was not as big as the reindeer which he shot in Norway; and Orlando would ask, had he ever shot a tiger, and the Archduke would say he had shot an albatross, and Orlando would say (half hiding her yawn) was an albatross as big as an elephant, and the Archduke would say--something very sensible, no doubt, but Orlando heard it not, for she was looking at her writing-table, out of the window, at the door. Upon which the Archduke would say, 'I adore you', at the very same moment that Orlando said 'Look, it's beginning to rain', at which they were both much embarrassed, and blushed scarlet, and could neither of them think what to say next. Indeed, Orlando was at her wit's end what to talk about and had she not bethought her of a game called Fly Loo, at which great sums of money can be lost with very little expense of spirit, she would have had to marry him, she supposed; for how else to get rid of him she knew not. By this device, however, and it was a simple one, needing only three lumps of sugar and a sufficiency of flies, the embarrassment of conversation was overcome and the necessity of marriage avoided. For now, the Archduke would bet her five hundred pounds to a tester that a fly would settle on this lump and not on that. Thus, they would have occupation for a whole morning watching the flies (who were naturally sluggish at this season and often spent an hour or so circling round the ceiling) until at length some fine bluebottle made his choice and the match was won. Many hundreds of pounds changed hands between them at this game, which the Archduke, who was a born gambler, swore was every bit as good as horse racing, and vowed he could play at for ever.

229,229,3,"She began to detest the sight of sugar; flies made her dizzy. Some way out of the difficulty there must be, she supposed, but she was still awkward in the arts of her sex, and as she could no longer knock a man over the head or run him through the body with a rapier, she could think of no better method than this. She caught a blue-bottle, gently pressed the life out of it (it was half dead already; or her kindness for the dumb creatures would not have permitted it) and secured it by a drop of gum arabic to a lump of sugar. While the Archduke was gazing at the ceiling, she deftly substituted this lump for the one she had laid her money on, and crying 'Loo Loo!' declared that she had won her bet. Her reckoning was that the Archduke, with all his knowledge of sport and horseracing, would detect the fraud and, as to cheat at Loo is the most heinous of crimes, and men have been banished from the society of mankind to that of apes in the tropics for ever because of it, she calculated that he would be manly enough to refuse to have anything further to do with her. But she misjudged the simplicity of the amiable nobleman. He was no nice judge of flies. A dead fly looked to him much the same as a living one. She played the trick twenty times on him and he paid her over   ,    pounds (which is about   ,    pounds   shillings and   pence of our own money) before Orlando cheated so grossly that even he could be deceived no longer. When he realized the truth at last, a painful scene ensued. The Archduke rose to his full height. He coloured scarlet. Tears rolled down his cheeks one by one. That she had won a fortune from him was nothing--she was welcome to it; that she had deceived him was something--it hurt him to think her capable of it; but that she had cheated at Loo was everything. To love a woman who cheated at play was, he said, impossible. Here he broke down completely. Happily, he said, recovering slightly, there were no witnesses. She was, after all, only a woman, he said. In short, he was preparing in the chivalry of his heart to forgive her and had bent to ask her pardon for the violence of his language, when she cut the matter short, as he stooped his proud head, by dropping a small toad between his skin and his shirt.",she began to detest the sight of sugar  flies made her dizzy  some way out of the difficulty there must be  she supposed  but she was still awkward in the arts of her sex  and as she could no longer knock a man over the head or run him through the body with a rapier  she could think of no better method than this  she caught a blue bottle  gently pressed the life out of it  it was half dead already  or her kindness for the dumb creatures would not have permitted it  and secured it by a drop of gum arabic to a lump of sugar  while the archduke was gazing at the ceiling  she deftly substituted this lump for the one she had laid her money on  and crying  loo loo   declared that she had won her bet  her reckoning was that the archduke  with all his knowledge of sport and horseracing  would detect the fraud and  as to cheat at loo is the most heinous of crimes  and men have been banished from the society of mankind to that of apes in the tropics for ever because of it  she calculated that he would be manly enough to refuse to have anything further to do with her  but she misjudged the simplicity of the amiable nobleman  he was no nice judge of flies  a dead fly looked to him much the same as a living one  she played the trick twenty times on him and he paid her over        pounds  which is about        pounds   shillings and   pence of our own money  before orlando cheated so grossly that even he could be deceived no longer  when he realized the truth at last  a painful scene ensued  the archduke rose to his full height  he coloured scarlet  tears rolled down his cheeks one by one  that she had won a fortune from him was nothing  she was welcome to it  that she had deceived him was something  it hurt him to think her capable of it  but that she had cheated at loo was everything  to love a woman who cheated at play was  he said  impossible  here he broke down completely  happily  he said  recovering slightly  there were no witnesses  she was  after all  only a woman  he said  in short  he was preparing in the chivalry of his heart to forgive her and had bent to ask her pardon for the violence of his language  when she cut the matter short  as he stooped his proud head  by dropping a small toad between his skin and his shirt ,2257,430,-4.65,-1.414141660436966,-1.4596491228070176,-1.414141660436966,-0.5387350354459122,-5.6499999999999995,-1.705001147300663,-1.6965517241379309,-1.705001147300663,-0.5501246246015887,-99.06443420818408,-1.3980851241743015,-1.429726333828048,-1.3980851241743015,-0.4794478118889448,-5.301337301587299,-2.487041846982729,-2.6865534345742907,-2.487041846982729,-0.921806045695018,6.634000000000001,0.2900349756362427,0.4727371494533852,0.2900349756362427,-0.27959332287531335,-31.121413922764866,-1.3682334531493356,-1.4515158577036784,-1.3682334531493356,-0.6362550269434103,-4.378775007744912,-3.1276581537619568,-2.4430230864483558,-3.1276581537619568,-0.893422482980296,"{'neg': 0.195, 'neu': 0.687, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': -0.9912}",-0.9912,-1.8452680484484152,-1.0314703217929024,-1.8452680484484152,-0.5871911527289403,0.07121913580246914,-0.2865983764454494,-0.20858246785348974,-0.2865983764454494,-0.21259082890165484,0.7099756661529752,0.8821220187081885,0.7507682613794341,0.8821220187081885,-0.015856504692535203,67.95210104611549,1.405605596102359,1.1802034082958175,1.405605596102359,-0.5376311127839231,-1.0,-0.8067597835723693,-0.06038938543615332,-0.8067597835723693,0.07772530516296336

Then since pearls do not show to advantage against a morning gown of sprigged cotton, she changed to a dove grey taffeta; thence to one of peach bloom; thence to a wine-coloured brocade. Perhaps a dash of powder was needed, and if her hair were disposed--so--about her brow, it might become her. Then she slipped her feet into pointed slippers, and drew an emerald ring upon her finger. 'Now,' she said when all was ready and lit the silver sconces on either side of the mirror. What woman would not have kindled to see what Orlando saw then burning in the snow--for all about the looking-glass were snowy lawns, and she was like a fire, a burning bush, and the candle flames about her head were silver leaves; or again, the glass was green water, and she a mermaid, slung with pearls, a siren in a cave, singing so that oarsmen leant from their boats and fell down, down to embrace her; so dark, so bright, so hard, so soft, was she, so astonishingly seductive that it was a thousand pities that there was no one there to put it in plain English, and say outright, 'Damn it, Madam, you are loveliness incarnate,' which was the truth. Even Orlando (who had no conceit of her person) knew it, for she smiled the involuntary smile which women smile when their own beauty, which seems not their own, forms like a drop falling or a fountain rising and confronts them all of a sudden in the glass--this smile she smiled and then she listened for a moment and heard only the leaves blowing and the sparrows twittering, and then she sighed, 'Life, a lover,' and then she turned on her heel with extraordinary rapidity; whipped her pearls from her neck, stripped the satins from her back, stood erect in the neat black silk knickerbockers of an ordinary nobleman, and rang the bell.

236,236,3,"And as she drove, we may seize the opportunity, since the landscape was of a simple English kind which needs no description, to draw the reader's attention more particularly than we could at the moment to one or two remarks which have slipped in here and there in the course of the narrative. For example, it may have been observed that Orlando hid her manuscripts when interrupted. Next, that she looked long and intently in the glass; and now, as she drove to London, one might notice her starting and suppressing a cry when the horses galloped faster than she liked. Her modesty as to her writing, her vanity as to her person, her fears for her safety all seems to hint that what was said a short time ago about there being no change in Orlando the man and Orlando the woman, was ceasing to be altogether true. She was becoming a little more modest, as women are, of her brains, and a little more vain, as women are, of her person. Certain susceptibilities were asserting themselves, and others were diminishing. The change of clothes had, some philosophers will say, much to do with it. Vain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than merely to keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world's view of us. For example, when Captain Bartolus saw Orlando's skirt, he had an awning stretched for her immediately, pressed her to take another slice of beef, and invited her to go ashore with him in the long-boat. These compliments would certainly not have been paid her had her skirts, instead of flowing, been cut tight to her legs in the fashion of breeches. And when we are paid compliments, it behoves us to make some return. Orlando curtseyed; she complied; she flattered the good man's humours as she would not have done had his neat breeches been a woman's skirts, and his braided coat a woman's satin bodice. Thus, there is much to support the view that it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may make them take the mould of arm or breast, but they mould our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking. So, having now worn skirts for a considerable time, a certain change was visible in Orlando, which is to be found if the reader will look at the above, even in her face. If we compare the picture of Orlando as a man with that of Orlando as a woman we shall see that though both are undoubtedly one and the same person, there are certain changes. The man has his hand free to seize his sword, the woman must use hers to keep the satins from slipping from her shoulders. The man looks the world full in the face, as if it were made for his uses and fashioned to his liking. The woman takes a sidelong glance at it, full of subtlety, even of suspicion.

237,237,3,"That is the view of some philosophers and wise ones, but on the whole, we incline to another. The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual--openness indeed was the soul of her nature--something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed. For here again, we come to a dilemma. Different though the sexes are, they intermix. In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above. Of the complications and confusions which thus result everyone has had experience; but here we leave the general question and note only the odd effect it had in the particular case of Orlando herself.",that is the view of some philosophers and wise ones  but on the whole  we incline to another  the difference between the sexes is  happily  one of great profundity  clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath  it was a change in orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman own dress and of a woman own sex  and perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual  openness indeed was the soul of her nature  something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed  for here again  we come to a dilemma  different though the sexes are  they intermix  in every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place  and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness  while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above  of the complications and confusions which thus result everyone has had experience  but here we leave the general question and note only the odd effect it had in the particular case of orlando herself ,1015,179,2.5,0.42198681204695726,0.5473684210526316,0.42198681204695726,0.2847981261013969,2.5,0.4248376926683301,0.5517241379310345,0.4248376926683301,0.29790222017141516,32.20878428217144,0.4925668416335675,0.46484641472875937,0.4925668416335675,0.3744668132109517,1.924999999999999,0.6652410315905273,0.8106113461391099,0.6652410315905273,0.4847766634334884,5.814,0.1563171034409522,0.36137706253819524,0.1563171034409522,0.13740123394147094,59.17359672482182,1.3588970016493325,1.8580374286085501,1.3588970016493325,1.0744001786939419,-0.37668428590395353,-0.5011585910309364,-0.2101611535504774,-0.5011585910309364,-0.18462783387855405,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.8573}",0.8573,0.9618542981553753,0.4246721020914569,0.9618542981553753,0.41144846787097694,0.16642857142857143,0.35029396013996617,0.3077956692604904,0.35029396013996617,0.36747167313366697,0.8354681204279791,1.1955737569517841,0.9697060935973767,1.1955737569517841,0.9414461861103643,35.21998073201965,0.11239422727278653,0.234650502120002,0.11239422727278653,-0.08457439299921349,-0.654,-0.40817372305419236,0.13139333471904657,-0.40817372305419236,-0.030577240911631536
238,238,3,"For it was this mixture in her of man and woman, one being uppermost and then the other, that often gave her conduct an unexpected turn. The curious of her own sex would argue, for example, if Orlando was a woman, how did she never take more than ten minutes to dress? And were not her clothes chosen rather at random, and sometimes worn rather shabby? And then they would say, still, she has none of the formality of a man, or a man's love of power. She is excessively tender-hearted. She could not endure to see a donkey beaten or a kitten drowned. Yet again, they noted, she detested household matters, was up at dawn and out among the fields in summer before the sun had risen. No farmer knew more about the crops than she did. She could drink with the best and liked games of hazard. She rode well and drove six horses at a gallop over London Bridge. Yet again, though bold and active as a man, it was remarked that the sight of another in danger brought on the most womanly palpitations. She would burst into tears on slight provocation. She was unversed in geography, found mathematics intolerable, and held some caprices which are more common among women than men, as for instance that to travel south is to travel downhill. Whether, then, Orlando was most man or woman, it is difficult to say and cannot now be decided. For her coach was now rattling on the cobbles. She had reached her home in the city. The steps were being let down; the iron gates were being opened. She was entering her father's house at Blackfriars, which though fashion was fast deserting that end of the town, was still a pleasant, roomy mansion, with gardens running down to the river, and a pleasant grove of nut trees to walk in.",for it was this mixture in her of man and woman  one being uppermost and then the other  that often gave her conduct an unexpected turn  the curious of her own sex would argue  for example  if orlando was a woman  how did she never take more than ten minutes to dress  and were not her clothes chosen rather at random  and sometimes worn rather shabby  and then they would say  still  she has none of the formality of a man  or a man own love of power  she is excessively tender hearted  she could not endure to see a donkey beaten or a kitten drowned  yet again  they noted  she detested household matters  was up at dawn and out among the fields in summer before the sun had risen  no farmer knew more about the crops than she did  she could drink with the best and liked games of hazard  she rode well and drove six horses at a gallop over london bridge  yet again  though bold and active as a man  it was remarked that the sight of another in danger brought on the most womanly palpitations  she would burst into tears on slight provocation  she was unversed in geography  found mathematics intolerable  and held some caprices which are more common among women than men  as for instance that to travel south is to travel downhill  whether  then  orlando was most man or woman  it is difficult to say and cannot now be decided  for her coach was now rattling on the cobbles  she had reached her home in the city  the steps were being let down  the iron gates were being opened  she was entering her father own house at blackfriars  which though fashion was fast deserting that end of the town  was still a pleasant  roomy mansion  with gardens running down to the river  and a pleasant grove of nut trees to walk in ,1715,315,2.55,0.4348268712950965,0.5614035087719298,0.4348268712950965,0.08967794423850016,2.55,0.43790418861906005,0.5655172413793103,0.43790418861906005,0.11421712054812035,-14.788411731779181,-0.18430649211319045,-0.21343060057238594,-0.18430649211319045,-0.097701900730367,0.9446892857142861,0.23760853239262913,0.33619284599479077,0.23760853239262913,0.012205809644814316,6.770000000000001,0.31221257395155916,0.49120662728322156,0.31221257395155916,-0.13130337510833864,44.410463016555084,0.9130142086208888,1.3169291510852796,0.9130142086208888,0.2695231675919222,1.876476216553234,0.9775497856108523,1.0469308676747326,0.9775497856108523,0.5226430898783944,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.8271}",0.8271,0.9159927375021784,0.40088227185001374,0.9159927375021784,0.10688475777888816,0.20737547892720312,0.6242034883422397,0.5298754208699528,0.6242034883422397,0.16142570715886212,1.0418980168524123,1.711188900774598,1.329849771472215,1.711188900774598,0.509877374286338,54.58839902700317,0.8776198984167629,0.7941579226937854,0.8776198984167629,-0.3590315337890237,-0.9878,-0.7927055929991851,-0.05362710455206824,-0.7927055929991851,0.0116459761746026
239,239,3,"Here she took up her lodging and began instantly to look about her for what she had come in search of--that is to say, life and a lover. About the first there might be some doubt; the second she found without the least difficulty two days after her arrival. It was a Tuesday that she came to town. On Thursday she went for a walk in the Mall, as was then the habit of persons of quality. She had not made more than a turn or two of the avenue before she was observed by a little knot of vulgar people who go there to spy upon their betters. As she came past them, a common woman carrying a child at her breast stepped forward, peered familiarly into Orlando's face, and cried out, 'Lawk upon us, if it ain't the Lady Orlando!' Her companions came crowding round, and Orlando found herself in a moment the centre of a mob of staring citizens and tradesmen's wives, all eager to gaze upon the heroine of the celebrated lawsuit. Such was the interest that the case excited in the minds of the common people. She might, indeed, have found herself gravely discommoded by the pressure of the crowd--she had forgotten that ladies are not supposed to walk in public places alone--had not a tall gentleman at once stepped forward and offered her the protection of his arm. It was the Archduke. She was overcome with distress and yet with some amusement at the sight. Not only had this magnanimous nobleman forgiven her, but in order to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part, he had procured a jewel made in the shape of that reptile which he pressed upon her with a repetition of his suit as he handed her to her coach.",here she took up her lodging and began instantly to look about her for what she had come in search of  that is to say  life and a lover  about the first there might be some doubt  the second she found without the least difficulty two days after her arrival  it was a tuesday that she came to town  on thursday she went for a walk in the mall  as was then the habit of persons of quality  she had not made more than a turn or two of the avenue before she was observed by a little knot of vulgar people who go there to spy upon their betters  as she came past them  a common woman carrying a child at her breast stepped forward  peered familiarly into orlando own face  and cried out   lawk upon us  if it are not the lady orlando   her companions came crowding round  and orlando found herself in a moment the centre of a mob of staring citizens and tradesmen own wives  all eager to gaze upon the heroine of the celebrated lawsuit  such was the interest that the case excited in the minds of the common people  she might  indeed  have found herself gravely discommoded by the pressure of the crowd  she had forgotten that ladies are not supposed to walk in public places alone  had not a tall gentleman at once stepped forward and offered her the protection of his arm  it was the archduke  she was overcome with distress and yet with some amusement at the sight  not only had this magnanimous nobleman forgiven her  but in order to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part  he had procured a jewel made in the shape of that reptile which he pressed upon her with a repetition of his suit as he handed her to her coach ,1628,305,6.05,1.3336310186648492,1.543859649122807,1.3336310186648492,0.4798632330765609,5.05,1.091228986155561,1.2551724137931033,1.091228986155561,0.3789598689604421,89.02350677804387,1.3108363105240675,1.284812788642304,1.3108363105240675,0.6074309151463656,0.4713333333333335,0.031120542434914772,0.10711361867390441,0.031120542434914772,-0.07637458722911827,9.808000000000003,0.8076209833775251,0.9037821688055958,0.8076209833775251,0.12950103953826905,50.82658993441846,1.106796954689222,1.552097337833576,1.106796954689222,0.378452770968404,1.027433693322694,0.4203385750215899,0.5732297795942077,0.4203385750215899,0.2955470757347113,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.8838}",0.8838,1.002097058331194,0.4455472842569618,1.002097058331194,0.1451708321624503,0.07562499999999998,-0.25712586539661647,-0.18468681159067257,-0.25712586539661647,-0.15009778524725445,0.2630529521848024,-0.23418973376482505,-0.02894626990805619,-0.23418973376482505,-0.2661503861430131,53.255313103892966,0.8249510870214202,0.7556482491167854,0.8249510870214202,-0.34369536598556094,-0.5738,-0.3157846997780137,0.1758470172521305,-0.3157846997780137,0.11395554308679977
240,240,3,"What with the crowd, what with the Duke, what with the jewel, she drove home in the vilest temper imaginable. Was it impossible then to go for a walk without being half-suffocated, presented with a toad set in emeralds, and asked in marriage by an Archduke?

241,241,3,"To give a truthful account of London society at that or indeed at any other time, is beyond the powers of the biographer or the historian. Only those who have little need of the truth, and no respect for it--the poets and the novelists--can be trusted to do it, for this is one of the cases where the truth does not exist. Nothing exists. The whole thing is a miasma--a mirage. To make our meaning plain--Orlando could come home from one of these routs at three or four in the morning with cheeks like a Christmas tree and eyes like stars. She would untie a lace, pace the room a score of times, untie another lace, stop, and pace the room again. Often the sun would be blazing over Southwark chimneys before she could persuade herself to get into bed, and there she would lie, pitching and tossing, laughing and sighing for an hour or longer before she slept at last. And what was all this stir about? Society. And what had society said or done to throw a reasonable lady into such an excitement? In plain language, nothing. Rack her memory as she would, next day Orlando could never remember a single word to magnify into the name something. Lord O. had been gallant. Lord A. polite. The Marquis of C. charming. Mr M. amusing. But when she tried to recollect in what their gallantry, politeness, charm, or wit had consisted, she was bound to suppose her memory at fault, for she could not name a thing. It was the same always. Nothing remained over the next day, yet the excitement of the moment was intense. Thus we are forced to conclude that society is one of those brews such as skilled housekeepers serve hot about Christmas time, whose flavour depends upon the proper mixing and stirring of a dozen different ingredients. Take one out, and it is in itself insipid. Take away Lord O., Lord A., Lord C., or Mr M. and separately each is nothing. Stir them all together and they combine to give off the most intoxicating of flavours, the most seductive of scents. Yet this intoxication, this seductiveness, entirely evade our analysis. At one and the same time, therefore, society is everything and society is nothing. Society is the most powerful concoction in the world and society has no existence whatsoever. Such monsters the poets and the novelists alone can deal with; with such something-nothings their works are stuffed out to prodigious size; and to them with the best will in the world we are content to leave it.",to give a truthful account of london society at that or indeed at any other time  is beyond the powers of the biographer or the historian  only those who have little need of the truth  and no respect for it  the poets and the novelists  can be trusted to do it  for this is one of the cases where the truth does not exist  nothing exists  the whole thing is a miasma  a mirage  to make our meaning plain  orlando could come home from one of these routs at three or four in the morning with cheeks like a christmas tree and eyes like stars  she would untie a lace  pace the room a score of times  untie another lace  stop  and pace the room again  often the sun would be blazing over southwark chimneys before she could persuade herself to get into bed  and there she would lie  pitching and tossing  laughing and sighing for an hour or longer before she slept at last  and what was all this stir about  society  and what had society said or done to throw a reasonable lady into such an excitement  in plain language  nothing  rack her memory as she would  next day orlando could never remember a single word to magnify into the name something  lord o  had been gallant  lord a  polite  the marquis of c  charming  mr m  amusing  but when she tried to recollect in what their gallantry  politeness  charm  or wit had consisted  she was bound to suppose her memory at fault  for she could not name a thing  it was the same always  nothing remained over the next day  yet the excitement of the moment was intense  thus we are forced to conclude that society is one of those brews such as skilled housekeepers serve hot about christmas time  whose flavour depends upon the proper mixing and stirring of a dozen different ingredients  take one out  and it is in itself insipid  take away lord o   lord a   lord c   or mr m  and separately each is nothing  stir them all together and they combine to give off the most intoxicating of flavours  the most seductive of scents  yet this intoxication  this seductiveness  entirely evade our analysis  at one and the same time  therefore  society is everything and society is nothing  society is the most powerful concoction in the world and society has no existence whatsoever  such monsters the poets and the novelists alone can deal with  with such something nothings their works are stuffed out to prodigious size  and to them with the best will in the world we are content to leave it ,2428,434,13.149999999999999,3.156919431900633,3.5368421052631573,3.156919431900633,0.8275979625968652,13.149999999999999,3.208001330173824,3.4896551724137925,3.208001330173824,0.8088910942604959,225.84517362610484,3.281399357322534,3.2594623356212953,3.281399357322534,1.0829617495731572,8.095833333333335,3.357090505448195,3.796968071591903,3.357090505448195,0.9661605696358658,5.957000000000006,0.17963619578720505,0.38079717525633283,0.17963619578720505,-0.32121566512987604,105.69181895819905,2.7638612366153557,3.563054507201596,2.7638612366153557,0.7048514341094031,4.5274480810529045,2.7173345448423345,2.5259713424748074,2.7173345448423345,0.9152430746921943,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.9717}",0.9717,1.135581534537022,0.5147898696285793,1.135581534537022,0.05244146531102285,0.15117187499999998,0.24823608139014944,0.2250494117231821,0.24823608139014944,-0.07390556236022085,0.7937485381689596,1.0913676861291572,0.8969208815015829,1.0913676861291572,0.040575156967756265,72.43916929684647,1.5828849051992595,1.3098241106510145,1.5828849051992595,-0.4337306174969831,-0.9988,-0.8053774041717282,-0.059724243054112176,-0.8053774041717282,0.07969872743179897
242,242,3,"Following the example of our predecessors, therefore, we will only say that society in the reign of Queen Anne was of unparalleled brilliance. To have the entry there was the aim of every well-bred person. The graces were supreme. Fathers instructed their sons, mothers their daughters. No education was complete for either sex which did not include the science of deportment, the art of bowing and curtseying, the management of the sword and the fan, the care of the teeth, the conduct of the leg, the flexibility of the knee, the proper methods of entering and leaving the room, with a thousand etceteras, such as will immediately suggest themselves to anybody who has himself been in society. Since Orlando had won the praise of Queen Elizabeth for the way she handed a bowl of rose water as a boy, it must be supposed that she was sufficiently expert to pass muster. Yet it is true that there was an absentmindedness about her which sometimes made her clumsy; she was apt to think of poetry when she should have been thinking of taffeta; her walk was a little too much of a stride for a woman, perhaps, and her gestures, being abrupt, might endanger a cup of tea on occasion.",following the example of our predecessors  therefore  we will only say that society in the reign of queen anne was of unparalleled brilliance  to have the entry there was the aim of every well bred person  the graces were supreme  fathers instructed their sons  mothers their daughters  no education was complete for either sex which did not include the science of deportment  the art of bowing and curtseying  the management of the sword and the fan  the care of the teeth  the conduct of the leg  the flexibility of the knee  the proper methods of entering and leaving the room  with a thousand etceteras  such as will immediately suggest themselves to anybody who has himself been in society  since orlando had won the praise of queen elizabeth for the way she handed a bowl of rose water as a boy  it must be supposed that she was sufficiently expert to pass muster  yet it is true that there was an absentmindedness about her which sometimes made her clumsy  she was apt to think of poetry when she should have been thinking of taffeta  her walk was a little too much of a stride for a woman  perhaps  and her gestures  being abrupt  might endanger a cup of tea on occasion ,1179,209,8.6,1.9884740403199546,2.2596491228070175,1.9884740403199546,1.1881378632283661,8.1,1.8882852391500922,2.096551724137931,1.8882852391500922,1.0734556006080676,94.53124861934974,1.3901611191878562,1.3643020989420345,1.3901611191878562,0.9412850071061079,1.6472666666666669,0.5440878117867083,0.6762031125862534,0.5440878117867083,0.3097355699775542,16.311000000000003,1.868068938116516,1.7869219800366682,1.868068938116516,1.2515673709760415,45.611200586099976,0.9492794238375651,1.3609393897550068,0.9492794238375651,0.5974706509263269,3.671673431672771,2.1557051619483665,2.0485142405376107,2.1557051619483665,1.5413116572172592,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9799}",0.9799,1.1480340112706713,0.5212493599590373,1.1480340112706713,0.39724993607799286,0.10312499999999997,-0.07316784547009993,-0.035537741677046146,-0.07316784547009993,0.03623925007989038,0.23100152328550763,-0.31424694644519,-0.08486413686857869,-0.31424694644519,-0.189091164086588,40.0212404052332,0.30208690634524016,0.37334744548168114,0.30208690634524016,-0.14622511347285774,-0.9594,-0.7599892805173464,-0.03788540151042757,-0.7599892805173464,-0.10697328157638103
243,243,3,"Whether this slight disability was enough to counterbalance the splendour of her bearing, or whether she inherited a drop too much of that black humour which ran in the veins of all her race, certain it is that she had not been in the world more than a score of times before she might have been heard to ask herself, had there been anybody but her spaniel Pippin to hear her, 'What the devil is the matter with me?' The occasion was Tuesday, the   th of June     ; she had just returned from a great ball at Arlington House; the dawn was in the sky, and she was pulling off her stockings. 'I don't care if I never meet another soul as long as I live,' cried Orlando, bursting into tears. Lovers she had in plenty, but life, which is, after all, of some importance in its way, escaped her. 'Is this', she asked--but there was none to answer, 'is this', she finished her sentence all the same, 'what people call life?' The spaniel raised her forepaw in token of sympathy. The spaniel licked Orlando with her tongue. Orlando stroked the spaniel with her hand. Orlando kissed the spaniel with her lips. In short, there was the truest sympathy between them that can be between a dog and its mistress, and yet it cannot be denied that the dumbness of animals is a great impediment to the refinements of intercourse. They wag their tails; they bow the front part of the body and elevate the hind; they roll, they jump, they paw, they whine, they bark, they slobber, they have all sorts of ceremonies and artifices of their own, but the whole thing is of no avail, since speak they cannot. Such was her quarrel, she thought, setting the dog gently on to the floor, with the great people at Arlington House. They, too, wag their tails, bow, roll, jump, paw, and slobber, but talk they cannot. 'All these months that I've been out in the world', said Orlando, pitching one stocking across the room, 'I've heard nothing but what Pippin might have said. I'm cold. I'm happy. I'm hungry. I've caught a mouse. I've buried a bone. Please kiss my nose.' And it was not enough.",whether this slight disability was enough to counterbalance the splendour of her bearing  or whether she inherited a drop too much of that black humour which ran in the veins of all her race  certain it is that she had not been in the world more than a score of times before she might have been heard to ask herself  had there been anybody but her spaniel pippin to hear her   what the devil is the matter with me   the occasion was tuesday  the   th of june       she had just returned from a great ball at arlington house  the dawn was in the sky  and she was pulling off her stockings   i do not care if i never meet another soul as long as i live   cried orlando  bursting into tears  lovers she had in plenty  but life  which is  after all  of some importance in its way  escaped her   is this   she asked  but there was none to answer   is this   she finished her sentence all the same   what people call life   the spaniel raised her forepaw in token of sympathy  the spaniel licked orlando with her tongue  orlando stroked the spaniel with her hand  orlando kissed the spaniel with her lips  in short  there was the truest sympathy between them that can be between a dog and its mistress  and yet it cannot be denied that the dumbness of animals is a great impediment to the refinements of intercourse  they wag their tails  they bow the front part of the body and elevate the hind  they roll  they jump  they paw  they whine  they bark  they slobber  they have all sorts of ceremonies and artifices of their own  but the whole thing is of no avail  since speak they cannot  such was her quarrel  she thought  setting the dog gently on to the floor  with the great people at arlington house  they  too  wag their tails  bow  roll  jump  paw  and slobber  but talk they cannot   these months that I have been out in the world   said orlando  pitching one stocking across the room   I have heard nothing but what pippin might have said  I am cold  I am happy  I am hungry  I have caught a mouse  I have buried a bone  please kiss my nose   and it was not enough ,2060,377,0.24999999999999978,-0.15581585411931237,-0.08421052631578956,-0.15581585411931237,-0.15731480473666792,1.0499999999999998,0.0459093100971595,0.15172413793103443,0.0459093100971595,-0.05191208304464792,28.774318127687334,0.44310221921362564,0.4152792139169324,0.44310221921362564,0.15883848044789212,-1.9458333333333337,-1.0232992528212028,-1.062667112973411,-1.0232992528212028,-0.4850563185590143,17.137999999999995,2.00292830434274,1.8992327018401571,2.00292830434274,0.4547696987330929,31.34669956721482,0.5184565591841009,0.8381073319693505,0.5184565591841009,0.02398498983634494,2.4790755477011,1.3730247984895763,1.383135416953629,1.3730247984895763,0.5769273314009427,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9921}",0.9921,1.166560866898784,0.5308598211824018,1.166560866898784,0.10770831693111903,0.2133658008658009,0.6642750433439423,0.5623645461654092,0.6642750433439423,0.09130148344784843,0.7159154369126571,0.896958221252373,0.7611309604079071,0.896958221252373,0.06281243981962967,64.29069253704853,1.2609472279789946,1.0744340470927114,1.2609472279789946,-0.3913649615961769,-0.9991,-0.8057229990218884,-0.059890528649622445,-0.8057229990218884,0.05125813334456118

245,245,3,"Orlando threw the second stocking after the first and went to bed dismally enough, determined that she would forswear society for ever. But again as it turned out, she was too hasty in coming to her conclusions. For the very next morning she woke to find, among the usual cards of invitation upon her table, one from a certain great Lady, the Countess of R. Having determined overnight that she would never go into society again, we can only explain Orlando's behaviour--she sent a messenger hot-foot to R-- House to say that she would attend her Ladyship with all the pleasure in the world--by the fact that she was still suffering from the effect of three honeyed words dropped into her ear on the deck of the ""Enamoured Lady"" by Captain Nicholas Benedict Bartolus as they sailed down the Thames. Addison, Dryden, Pope, he had said, pointing to the Cocoa Tree, and Addison, Dryden, Pope had chimed in her head like an incantation ever since. Who can credit such folly? but so it was. All her experience with Nick Greene had taught her nothing. Such names still exercised over her the most powerful fascination. Something, perhaps, we must believe in, and as Orlando, we have said, had no belief in the usual divinities she bestowed her credulity upon great men--yet with a distinction. Admirals, soldiers, statesmen, moved her not at all. But the very thought of a great writer stirred her to such a pitch of belief that she almost believed him to be invisible. Her instinct was a sound one. One can only believe entirely, perhaps, in what one cannot see. The little glimpse she had of these great men from the deck of the ship was of the nature of a vision. That the cup was china, or the gazette paper, she doubted. When Lord O. said one day that he had dined with Dryden the night before, she flatly disbelieved him. Now, the Lady R.'s reception room had the reputation of being the antechamber to the presence room of genius; it was the place where men and women met to swing censers and chant hymns to the bust of genius in a niche in the wall. Sometimes the God himself vouchsafed his presence for a moment. Intellect alone admitted the suppliant, and nothing (so the report ran) was said inside that was not witty.",orlando threw the second stocking after the first and went to bed dismally enough  determined that she would forswear society for ever  but again as it turned out  she was too hasty in coming to her conclusions  for the very next morning she woke to find  among the usual cards of invitation upon her table  one from a certain great lady  the countess of r  having determined overnight that she would never go into society again  we can only explain orlando own behaviour  she sent a messenger hot foot to r   house to say that she would attend her ladyship with all the pleasure in the world  by the fact that she was still suffering from the effect of three honeyed words dropped into her ear on the deck of the  enamoured lady  by captain nicholas benedict bartolus as they sailed down the thames  addison  dryden  pope  he had said  pointing to the cocoa tree  and addison  dryden  pope had chimed in her head like an incantation ever since  who can credit such folly  but so it was  all her experience with nick greene had taught her nothing  such names still exercised over her the most powerful fascination  something  perhaps  we must believe in  and as orlando  we have said  had no belief in the usual divinities she bestowed her credulity upon great men  yet with a distinction  admirals  soldiers  statesmen  moved her not at all  but the very thought of a great writer stirred her to such a pitch of belief that she almost believed him to be invisible  her instinct was a sound one  one can only believe entirely  perhaps  in what one cannot see  the little glimpse she had of these great men from the deck of the ship was of the nature of a vision  that the cup was china  or the gazette paper  she doubted  when lord o  said one day that he had dined with dryden the night before  she flatly disbelieved him  now  the lady r  own reception room had the reputation of being the antechamber to the presence room of genius  it was the place where men and women met to swing censers and chant hymns to the bust of genius in a niche in the wall  sometimes the god himself vouchsafed his presence for a moment  intellect alone admitted the suppliant  and nothing  so the report ran  was said inside that was not witty ,2223,397,6.95,1.564752085131357,1.7964912280701755,1.564752085131357,0.40243757154574616,7.750000000000001,1.7968197674949824,2.0000000000000004,1.7968197674949824,0.471691315162531,128.59096407493,1.8807034302661858,1.8558616833555326,1.8807034302661858,0.6740808332212922,3.7044642857142867,1.4414814099157423,1.6717778775118437,1.4414814099157423,0.3980616917412245,9.749999999999998,0.7981628899783452,0.895905479731106,0.7981628899783452,-0.05630125157410205,137.50913952822833,3.724822238716285,4.729244278917453,3.724822238716285,1.141441195061953,3.443223222065641,2.00577743233335,1.9210564161033716,2.00577743233335,0.7609346736575784,"{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958,1.1721796673761624,0.5337744692583403,1.1721796673761624,0.09035896977762599,0.1927225056689342,0.5261841448285179,0.45040351785395094,0.5261841448285179,0.030186217073259396,1.0561319949555608,1.7467421553852367,1.3546827889452164,1.7467421553852367,0.3044307658021574,67.06087132499273,1.3703940547620803,1.1544579067886944,1.3703940547620803,-0.4102359612927499,-0.998,-0.8044558179046343,-0.059280814799418054,-0.8044558179046343,0.06237167106118387

248,248,3,"The truth would seem to be--if we dare use such a word in such a connection--that all these groups of people lie under an enchantment. The hostess is our modern Sibyl. She is a witch who lays her guests under a spell. In this house they think themselves happy; in that witty; in a third profound. It is all an illusion (which is nothing against it, for illusions are the most valuable and necessary of all things, and she who can create one is among the world's greatest benefactors), but as it is notorious that illusions are shattered by conflict with reality, so no real happiness, no real wit, no real profundity are tolerated where the illusion prevails. This serves to explain why Madame du Deffand said no more than three witty things in the course of fifty years. Had she said more, her circle would have been destroyed. The witticism, as it left her lips, bowled over the current conversation as a cannon ball lays low the violets and the daisies. When she made her famous 'mot de Saint Denis' the very grass was singed. Disillusionment and desolation followed. Not a word was uttered.

249,249,3,"For about the third time Orlando went there a certain incident occurred. She was still under the illusion that she was listening to the most brilliant epigrams in the world, though, as a matter of fact, old General C. was only saying, at some length, how the gout had left his left leg and gone to his right, while Mr L. interrupted when any proper name was mentioned, 'R.? Oh! I know Billy R. as well as I know myself. S.? My dearest friend. T.? Stayed with him a fortnight in Yorkshire'--which, such is the force of illusion, sounded like the wittiest repartee, the most searching comment upon human life, and kept the company in a roar; when the door opened and a little gentleman entered whose name Orlando did not catch. Soon a curiously disagreeable sensation came over her. To judge from their faces, the rest began to feel it as well. One gentleman said there was a draught. The Marchioness of C. feared a cat must be under the sofa. It was as if their eyes were being slowly opened after a pleasant dream and nothing met them but a cheap wash-stand and a dirty counterpane. It was as if the fumes of some delicious wine were slowly leaving them. Still the General talked and still Mr L. remembered. But it became more and more apparent how red the General's neck was, how bald Mr L.'s head was. As for what they said--nothing more tedious and trivial could be imagined. Everybody fidgeted and those who had fans yawned behind them. At last Lady R. rapped with hers upon the arm of her great chair.

Doors were slammed and carriages drove off. Orlando found herself near Mr Pope on the staircase. His lean and misshapen frame was shaken by a variety of emotions.

At the same time, the strangest tempest of emotion seized now upon the luckless Orlando. A disillusionment so complete as that inflicted not an hour ago leaves the mind rocking from side to side. Everything appears ten times more bare and stark than before. It is a moment fraught with the highest danger for the human spirit. Women turn nuns and men priests in such moments.

253,253,3,"For if it is rash to walk into a lion's den unarmed, rash to navigate the Atlantic in a rowing boat, rash to stand on one foot on the top of St Paul's, it is still more rash to go home alone with a poet. A poet is Atlantic and lion in one. While one drowns us the other gnaws us. If we survive the teeth, we succumb to the waves. A man who can destroy illusions is both beast and flood. Illusions are to the soul what atmosphere is to the earth. Roll up that tender air and the plant dies, the colour fades. The earth we walk on is a parched cinder.

254,254,3,"On this showing, however, Orlando should have been a heap of cinders by the time the chariot drew up at her house in Blackfriars. That she was still flesh and blood, though certainly exhausted, is entirely due to a fact to which we drew attention earlier in the narrative. The less we see the more we believe. Now the streets that lie between Mayfair and Blackfriars were at that time very imperfectly lit. True, the lighting was a great improvement upon that of the Elizabethan age. Then the benighted traveller had to trust to the stars or the red flame of some night watchman to save him from the gravel pits at Park Lane or the oak woods where swine rooted in the Tottenham Court Road. But even so it wanted much of our modern efficiency. Lamp-posts lit with oil-lamps occurred every two hundred yards or so, but between lay a considerable stretch of pitch darkness. Thus for ten minutes Orlando and Mr Pope would be in blackness; and then for about half a minute again in the light. A very strange state of mind was thus bred in Orlando. As the light faded, she began to feel steal over her the most delicious balm. 'This is indeed a very great honour for a young woman to be driving with Mr Pope,' she began to think, looking at the outline of his nose. 'I am the most blessed of my sex. Half an inch from me--indeed, I feel the knot of his knee ribbons pressing against my thigh--is the greatest wit in Her Majesty's dominions. Future ages will think of us with curiosity and envy me with fury.' Here came the lamp-post again. 'What a foolish wretch I am!' she thought. 'There is no such thing as fame and glory. Ages to come will never cast a thought on me or on Mr Pope either. What's an ""age"", indeed? What are ""we""?' and their progress through Berkeley Square seemed the groping of two blind ants, momentarily thrown together without interest or concern in common, across a blackened desert. She shivered. But here again was darkness. Her illusion revived. 'How noble his brow is,' she thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr Pope's forehead in the darkness). 'What a weight of genius lives in it! What wit, wisdom, and truth--what a wealth of all those jewels, indeed, for which people are ready to barter their lives! Yours is the only light that burns for ever. But for you the human pilgrimage would be performed in utter darkness'; (here the coach gave a great lurch as it fell into a rut in Park Lane) 'without genius we should be upset and undone. Most august, most lucid of beams,'--thus she was apostrophizing the hump on the cushion when they drove beneath one of the street lamps in Berkeley Square and she realized her mistake. Mr Pope had a forehead no bigger than another man's. 'Wretched man,' she thought, 'how you have deceived me! I took that hump for your forehead. When one sees you plain, how ignoble, how despicable you are! Deformed and weakly, there is nothing to venerate in you, much to pity, most to despise.'",on this showing  however  orlando should have been a heap of cinders by the time the chariot drew up at her house in blackfriars  that she was still flesh and blood  though certainly exhausted  is entirely due to a fact to which we drew attention earlier in the narrative  the less we see the more we believe  now the streets that lie between mayfair and blackfriars were at that time very imperfectly lit  true  the lighting was a great improvement upon that of the elizabethan age  then the benighted traveller had to trust to the stars or the red flame of some night watchman to save him from the gravel pits at park lane or the oak woods where swine rooted in the tottenham court road  but even so it wanted much of our modern efficiency  lamp posts lit with oil lamps occurred every two hundred yards or so  but between lay a considerable stretch of pitch darkness  thus for ten minutes orlando and mr pope would be in blackness  and then for about half a minute again in the light  a very strange state of mind was thus bred in orlando  as the light faded  she began to feel steal over her the most delicious balm   this is indeed a very great honour for a young woman to be driving with mr pope   she began to think  looking at the outline of his nose   i am the most blessed of my sex  half an inch from me  indeed  i feel the knot of his knee ribbons pressing against my thigh  is the greatest wit in her majesty own dominions  future ages will think of us with curiosity and envy me with fury   here came the lamp post again   what a foolish wretch i am   she thought   there is no such thing as fame and glory  ages to come will never cast a thought on me or on mr pope either  what is an  age   indeed  what are  we    and their progress through berkeley square seemed the groping of two blind ants  momentarily thrown together without interest or concern in common  across a blackened desert  she shivered  but here again was darkness  her illusion revived   how noble his brow is   she thought  mistaking a hump on a cushion for mr pope own forehead in the darkness    what a weight of genius lives in it  what wit  wisdom  and truth  what a wealth of all those jewels  indeed  for which people are ready to barter their lives  yours is the only light that burns for ever  but for you the human pilgrimage would be performed in utter darkness    here the coach gave a great lurch as it fell into a rut in park lane   without genius we should be upset and undone  most august  most lucid of beams    thus she was apostrophizing the hump on the cushion when they drove beneath one of the street lamps in berkeley square and she realized her mistake  mr pope had a forehead no bigger than another man own   wretched man   she thought   how you have deceived me  i took that hump for your forehead  when one sees you plain  how ignoble  how despicable you are  deformed and weakly  there is nothing to venerate in you  much to pity  most to despise  ,2953,536,-3.4499999999999997,-1.1059802384816222,-1.1228070175438596,-1.1059802384816222,-0.39326047239794903,-2.9500000000000006,-0.9994103659612422,-0.9517241379310346,-0.9994103659612422,-0.31123424161039964,-123.21258240616068,-1.7458768854045519,-1.7782393361763438,-1.7458768854045519,-0.4783902319224986,1.6931071428571443,0.5640844078782229,0.6983874768324747,0.5640844078782229,0.02194148492366453,7.268,0.39342172072382053,0.5588375093365927,0.39342172072382053,-0.3252775153876872,49.06636278812211,1.0536337840599663,1.4875803119768791,1.0536337840599663,0.05961981758642972,1.4052731589635716,0.66830776419374,0.7840354354909603,0.66830776419374,0.23002162316414945,"{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9806}",0.9806,1.1490970275772023,0.521800779865296,1.1490970275772023,-0.005195486526486429,0.22157142857142856,0.7191656260705397,0.606868609450931,0.7191656260705397,-0.02452045866190582,1.6786896737422663,3.3017502847581603,2.4408152533363023,3.3017502847581603,0.4541053607775293,85.87780415888493,2.1138311200600617,1.6980342274079159,2.1138311200600617,-0.5119946823652838,-0.9639,-0.7651732032697504,-0.040379685443081875,-0.7651732032697504,0.12072342972466223

260,260,3,"It was happy for Orlando, though at first disappointing, that this should be so, for she now began to live much in the company of men of genius. Nor were they so different from the rest of us as one might have supposed. Addison, Pope, Swift, proved, she found, to be fond of tea. They liked arbours. They collected little bits of coloured glass. They adored grottos. Rank was not distasteful to them. Praise was delightful. They wore plum-coloured suits one day and grey another. Mr Swift had a fine malacca cane. Mr Addison scented his handkerchiefs. Mr Pope suffered with his head. A piece of gossip did not come amiss. Nor were they without their jealousies. (We are jotting down a few reflections that came to Orlando higgledy-piggledy.) At first, she was annoyed with herself for noticing such trifles, and kept a book in which to write down their memorable sayings, but the page remained empty. All the same, her spirits revived, and she took to tearing up her cards of invitation to great parties; kept her evenings free; began to look forward to Mr Pope's visit, to Mr Addison's, to Mr Swift's--and so on and so on. If the reader will here refer to the ""Rape of the Lock"", to the ""Spectator"", to ""Gulliver's Travels"", he will understand precisely what these mysterious words may mean. Indeed, biographers and critics might save themselves all their labours if readers would only take this advice.

272,272,3,"'Lord,' she thought, as she raised the sugar tongs, 'how women in ages to come will envy me! And yet--' she paused; for Mr Pope needed her attention. And yet--let us finish her thought for her--when anybody says 'How future ages will envy me', it is safe to say that they are extremely uneasy at the present moment. Was this life quite so exciting, quite so flattering, quite so glorious as it sounds when the memoir writer has done his work upon it? For one thing, Orlando had a positive hatred of tea; for another, the intellect, divine as it is, and all-worshipful, has a habit of lodging in the most seedy of carcases, and often, alas, acts the cannibal among the other faculties so that often, where the Mind is biggest, the Heart, the Senses, Magnanimity, Charity, Tolerance, Kindliness, and the rest of them scarcely have room to breathe. Then the high opinion poets have of themselves; then the low one they have of others; then the enmities, injuries, envies, and repartees in which they are constantly engaged; then the volubility with which they impart them; then the rapacity with which they demand sympathy for them; all this, one may whisper, lest the wits may overhear us, makes pouring out tea a more precarious and, indeed, arduous occupation than is generally allowed. Added to which (we whisper again lest the women may overhear us), there is a little secret which men share among them; Lord Chesterfield whispered it to his son with strict injunctions to secrecy, 'Women are but children of a larger growth...A man of sense only trifles with them, plays with them, humours and flatters them', which, since children always hear what they are not meant to, and sometimes, even, grow up, may have somehow leaked out, so that the whole ceremony of pouring out tea is a curious one. A woman knows very well that, though a wit sends her his poems, praises her judgment, solicits her criticism, and drinks her tea, this by no means signifies that he respects her opinions, admires her understanding, or will refuse, though the rapier is denied him, to run her through the body with his pen. All this, we say, whisper it as low as we can, may have leaked out by now; so that even with the cream jug suspended and the sugar tongs distended the ladies may fidget a little, look out of the window a little, yawn a little, and so let the sugar fall with a great plop--as Orlando did now--into Mr Pope's tea. Never was any mortal so ready to suspect an insult or so quick to avenge one as Mr Pope. He turned to Orlando and presented her instantly with the rough draught of a certain famous line in the 'Characters of Women'. Much polish was afterwards bestowed on it, but even in the original it was striking enough. Orlando received it with a curtsey. Mr Pope left her with a bow. Orlando, to cool her cheeks, for really she felt as if the little man had struck her, strolled in the nut grove at the bottom of the garden. Soon the cool breezes did their work. To her amazement she found that she was hugely relieved to find herself alone. She watched the merry boatloads rowing up the river. No doubt the sight put her in mind of one or two incidents in her past life. She sat herself down in profound meditation beneath a fine willow tree. There she sat till the stars were in the sky. Then she rose, turned, and went into the house, where she sought her bedroom and locked the door. Now she opened a cupboard in which hung still many of the clothes she had worn as a young man of fashion, and from among them she chose a black velvet suit richly trimmed with Venetian lace. It was a little out of fashion, indeed, but it fitted her to perfection and dressed in it she looked the very figure of a noble Lord. She took a turn or two before the mirror to make sure that her petticoats had not lost her the freedom of her legs, and then let herself secretly out of doors.", lord   she thought  as she raised the

and  indeed  arduous occupation than is generally allowed  added to which  we whisper again lest the women may overhear us   there is a little secret which men share among them  lord chesterfield whispered it to his son with strict injunctions to secrecy   women are but children of a larger growth   a man of sense only trifles with them  plays with them  humours and flatters them   which  since children always hear what they are not meant to  and sometimes  even  grow up  may have somehow leaked out  so that the whole ceremony of pouring out tea is a curious one  a woman knows very well that  though a wit sends her his poems  praises her judgment  solicits her criticism  and drinks her tea  this by no means signifies that he respects her opinions  admires her understanding  or will refuse  though the rapier is denied him  to run her through the body with his pen  all this  we say  whisper it as low as we can  may have leaked out by now  so that even with the cream jug suspended and the sugar tongs distended the ladies may fidget a little  look out of the window a little  yawn a little  and so let the sugar fall with a great plop  as orlando did now  into mr pope own tea  never was any mortal so ready to suspect an insult or so quick to avenge one as mr pope  he turned to orlando and presented her instantly with the rough draught of a certain famous line in the  characters of women   much polish was afterwards bestowed on it  but even in the original it was striking enough  orlando received it with a curtsey  mr pope left her with a bow  orlando  to cool her cheeks  for really she felt as if the little man had struck her  strolled in the nut grove at the bottom of the garden  soon the cool breezes did their work  to her amazement she found that she was hugely relieved to find herself alone  she watched the merry boatloads rowing up the river  no doubt the sight put her in mind of one or two incidents in her past life  she sat herself down in profound meditation beneath a fine willow tree  there she sat till the stars were in the sky  then she rose  turned  and went into the house  where she sought her bedroom and locked the door  now she opened a cupboard in which hung still many of the clothes she had worn as a young man of fashion  and from among them she chose a black velvet suit richly trimmed with venetian lace  it was a little out of fashion  indeed  but it fitted her to perfection and dressed in it she looked the very figure of a noble lord  she took a turn or two before the mirror to make sure that her petticoats had not lost her the freedom of her legs  and then let herself secretly out of doors

A myriad stars mingling with the light of a sickle moon, which again was enforced by the street lamps, made a light infinitely becoming to the human countenance and to the architecture of Mr Wren. Everything appeared in its tenderest form, yet, just as it seemed on the point of dissolution, some drop of silver sharpened it to animation. Thus it was that talk should be, thought Orlando (indulging in foolish reverie); that society should be, that friendship should be, that love should be.

274,274,3,"She entered Leicester Square as she made these observations. The buildings had an airy yet formal symmetry not theirs by day. The canopy of the sky seemed most dexterously washed in to fill up the outline of roof and chimney. A young woman who sat dejectedly with one arm drooping by her side, the other reposing in her lap, on a seat beneath a plane tree in the middle of the square seemed the very figure of grace, simplicity, and desolation. Orlando swept her hat off to her in the manner of a gallant paying his addresses to a lady of fashion in a public place. The young woman raised her head. It was of the most exquisite shapeliness. The young woman raised her eyes. Orlando saw them to be of a lustre such as is sometimes seen on teapots but rarely in a human face. Through this silver glaze the young woman looked up at him (for a man he was to her) appealing, hoping, trembling, fearing. She rose; she accepted his arm. For--need we stress the point?--she was of the tribe which nightly burnishes their wares, and sets them in order on the common counter to wait the highest bidder. She led Orlando to the room in Gerrard Street which was her lodging. To feel her hanging lightly yet like a suppliant on her arm, roused in Orlando all the feelings which become a man. She looked, she felt, she talked like one. Yet, having been so lately a woman herself, she suspected that the girl's timidity and her hesitating answers and the very fumbling with the key in the latch and the fold of her cloak and the droop of her wrist were all put on to gratify her masculinity. Upstairs they went, and the pains which the poor creature had been at to decorate her room and hide the fact that she had no other deceived Orlando not a moment. The deception roused her scorn; the truth roused her pity. One thing showing through the other bred the oddest assortment of feeling, so that she did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Meanwhile Nell, as the girl called herself, unbuttoned her gloves; carefully concealed the left-hand thumb, which wanted mending; then drew behind a screen, where, perhaps, she rouged her cheeks, arranged her clothes, fixed a new kerchief round her neck--all the time prattling as women do, to amuse her lover, though Orlando could have sworn, from the tone of her voice, that her thoughts were elsewhere. When all was ready, out she came, prepared--but here Orlando could stand it no longer. In the strangest torment of anger, merriment, and pity she flung off all disguise and admitted herself a woman.",she entered leicester square as she made these observations  the buildings had an airy yet formal symmetry not theirs by day  the canopy of the sky seemed most dexterously washed in to fill up the outline of roof and chimney  a young woman who sat dejectedly with one arm drooping by her side  the other reposing in her lap  on a seat beneath a plane tree in the middle of the square seemed the very figure of grace  simplicity  and desolation  orlando swept her hat off to her in the manner of a gallant paying his addresses to a lady of fashion in a public place  the young woman raised her head  it was of the most exquisite shapeliness  the young woman raised her eyes  orlando saw them to be of a lustre such as is sometimes seen on teapots but rarely in a human face  through this silver glaze the young woman looked up at him  for a man he was to her  appealing  hoping  trembling  fearing  she rose  she accepted his arm  for  need we stress the point   she was of the tribe which nightly burnishes their wares  and sets them in order on the common counter to wait the highest bidder  she led orlando to the room in gerrard street which was her lodging  to feel her hanging lightly yet like a suppliant on her arm  roused in orlando all the feelings which become a man  she looked  she felt  she talked like one  yet  having been so lately a woman herself  she suspected that the girl own timidity and her hesitating answers and the very fumbling with the key in the latch and the fold of her cloak and the droop of her wrist were all put on to gratify her masculinity  upstairs they went  and the pains which the poor creature had been at to decorate her room and hide the fact that she had no other deceived orlando not a moment  the deception roused her scorn  the truth roused her pity  one thing showing through the other bred the oddest assortment of feeling  so that she did not know whether to laugh or to cry  meanwhile nell  as the girl called herself  unbuttoned her gloves  carefully concealed the left hand thumb  which wanted mending  then drew behind a screen  where  perhaps  she rouged her cheeks  arranged her clothes  fixed a new kerchief round her neck  all the time prattling as women do  to amuse her lover  though orlando could have sworn  from the tone of her voice  that her thoughts were elsewhere  when all was ready  out she came  prepared  but here orlando could stand it no longer  in the strangest torment of anger  merriment  and pity she flung off all disguise and admitted herself a woman ,2529,457,-0.6000000000000002,-0.37409686133768083,-0.32280701754385976,-0.37409686133768083,-0.22298494938441332,-1.6,-0.6466149752915316,-0.5793103448275863,-0.6466149752915316,-0.24858061551315774,-42.03018660236592,-0.5766539625528995,-0.6065917105509999,-0.5766539625528995,-0.19139789237380497,-1.9414166666666657,-1.0213726083632082,-1.0605296800706556,-1.0213726083632082,-0.4294103022916033,19.473000000000013,2.3836980989476246,2.216337339580365,2.3836980989476246,0.38511672808315645,24.78663808474292,0.3203266367676294,0.597663559029772,0.3203266367676294,-0.09874630657173253,-0.480944416770328,-0.5695826241585128,-0.26833036897080936,-0.5695826241585128,-0.09233181858373225,"{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': -0.5587}",-0.5587,-1.1884758304845853,-0.6907715939974005,-1.1884758304845853,-0.43480479684943046,0.0813961038961039,-0.21852074374143532,-0.15338663782780693,-0.21852074374143532,-0.2031143928121424,0.4817005716601057,0.31194251604494916,0.35251280748502617,0.31194251604494916,-0.2053474500131661,73.26386615467997,1.6154678036535655,1.333647636385237,1.6154678036535655,-0.5108831789369659,0.5883,1.0229345514594819,0.8199819857271531,1.0229345514594819,0.3723566899479167

276,276,3,"'Well, my dear,' she said, when she had somewhat recovered, 'I'm by no means sorry to hear it. For the plain Dunstable of the matter is' (and it was remarkable how soon, on discovering that they were of the same sex, her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive, appealing ways), 'the plain Dunstable of the matter is, that I'm not in the mood for the society of the other sex to-night. Indeed, I'm in the devil of a fix.' Whereupon, drawing up the fire and stirring a bowl of punch, she told Orlando the whole story of her life. Since it is Orlando's life that engages us at present, we need not relate the adventures of the other lady, but it is certain that Orlando had never known the hours speed faster or more merrily, though Mistress Nell had not a particle of wit about her, and when the name of Mr Pope came up in talk asked innocently if he were connected with the perruque maker of that name in Jermyn Street. Yet, to Orlando, such is the charm of ease and the seduction of beauty, this poor girl's talk, larded though it was with the commonest expressions of the street corners, tasted like wine after the fine phrases she had been used to, and she was forced to the conclusion that there was something in the sneer of Mr Pope, in the condescension of Mr Addison, and in the secret of Lord Chesterfield which took away her relish for the society of wits, deeply though she must continue to respect their works.", well  my dear   she said  when she had somewhat recovered   I am by no means sorry to hear it  for the plain dunstable of the matter is   and it was remarkable how soon  on discovering that they were of the same sex  her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive  appealing ways    the plain dunstable of the matter is  that I am not in the mood for the society of the other sex to night  indeed  I am in the devil of a fix   whereupon  drawing up the fire and stirring a bowl of punch  she told orlando the whole story of her life  since it is orlando own life that engages us at present  we need not relate the adventures of the other lady  but it is certain that orlando had never known the hours speed faster or more merrily  though mistress nell had not a particle of wit about her  and when the name of mr pope came up in talk asked innocently if he were connected with the perruque maker of that name in jermyn street  yet  to orlando  such is the charm of ease and the seduction of beauty  this poor girl own talk  larded though it was with the commonest expressions of the street corners  tasted like wine after the fine phrases she had been used to  and she was forced to the conclusion that there was something in the sneer of mr pope  in the condescension of mr addison  and in the secret of lord chesterfield which took away her relish for the society of wits  deeply though she must continue to respect their works ,1426,265,7.950000000000001,1.8215532700941437,2.0771929824561406,1.8215532700941437,0.8176433168978078,8.75,2.0581496865095827,2.2758620689655173,2.0581496865095827,0.8939668147248697,90.87991541479904,1.3375730865305286,1.3116050106494168,1.3375730865305286,0.7136973320131328,3.320183333333334,1.2738498399797222,1.4858062356580268,1.2738498399797222,0.5929264326508604,5.744000000000001,0.14490216313159826,0.35187071365519135,0.14490216313159826,-0.1268183996255258,64.09385875601328,1.5075009647544677,2.0383781723335987,1.5075009647544677,0.6977791336491129,3.5074681233868916,2.047940195987629,1.9569001799041617,2.047940195987629,1.161236186969252,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9692}",0.9692,1.1317850477279823,0.5128205128205129,1.1317850477279823,0.25210154862068906,0.09535147392290247,-0.12516793510609986,-0.07769825747153392,-0.12516793510609986,-0.0651799917851798,0.35679589408035345,-4.108909144030108e-05,0.13460042780309492,-4.108909144030108e-05,-0.1125627825189311,48.753806915077796,0.6471013502988798,0.6256104691575808,0.6471013502988798,-0.23410223735483812,-0.9998,-0.8065293870055958,-0.0602785283724798,-0.8065293870055958,-0.04029791847672195
277,277,3,"These poor creatures, she ascertained, for Nell brought Prue, and Prue Kitty, and Kitty Rose, had a society of their own of which they now elected her a member. Each would tell the story of the adventures which had landed her in her present way of life. Several were the natural daughters of earls and one was a good deal nearer than she should have been to the King's person. None was too wretched or too poor but to have some ring or handkerchief in her pocket which stood her in lieu of pedigree. So they would draw round the punch-bowl which Orlando made it her business to furnish generously, and many were the fine tales they told and many the amusing observations they made, for it cannot be denied that when women get together--but hist--they are always careful to see that the doors are shut and that not a word of it gets into print. All they desire is--but hist again--is that not a man's step on the stair? All they desire, we were about to say when the gentleman took the very words out of our mouths. Women have no desires, says this gentleman, coming into Nell's parlour; only affectations. Without desires (she has served him and he is gone) their conversation cannot be of the slightest interest to anyone. 'It is well known', says Mr S. W., 'that when they lack the stimulus of the other sex, women can find nothing to say to each other. When they are alone, they do not talk, they scratch.' And since they cannot talk together and scratching cannot continue without interruption and it is well known (Mr T. R. has proved it) 'that women are incapable of any feeling of affection for their own sex and hold each other in the greatest aversion', what can we suppose that women do when they seek out each other's society?",these poor creatures  she ascertained  for nell brought prue  and prue kitty  and kitty rose  had a society of their own of which they now elected her a member  each would tell the story of the adventures which had landed her in her present way of life  several were the natural daughters of earls and one was a good deal nearer than she should have been to the king own person  none was too wretched or too poor but to have some ring or handkerchief in her pocket which stood her in lieu of pedigree  so they would draw round the punch bowl which orlando made it her business to furnish generously  and many were the fine tales they told and many the amusing observations they made  for it cannot be denied that when women get together  but hist  they are always careful to see that the doors are shut and that not a word of it gets into print  all they desire is  but hist again  is that not a man own step on the stair  all they desire  we were about to say when the gentleman took the very words out of our mouths  women have no desires  says this gentleman  coming into nell own parlour  only affectations  without desires  she has served him and he is gone  their conversation cannot be of the slightest interest to anyone   it is well known   says mr s  w    that when they lack the stimulus of the other sex  women can find nothing to say to each other  when they are alone  they do not talk  they scratch   and since they cannot talk together and scratching cannot continue without interruption and it is well known  mr t  r  has proved it   that women are incapable of any feeling of affection for their own sex and hold each other in the greatest aversion   what can we suppose that women do when they seek out each other own society ,1737,317,6.4,1.4235114334018246,1.642105263157895,1.4235114334018246,0.49160149486804927,6.4,1.4440243768252716,1.6275862068965519,1.4440243768252716,0.4925858096989572,-29.468546341822705,-0.3957359495302191,-0.4252985146616366,-0.3957359495302191,-0.1934601338089956,0.7216166666666659,0.14029948517338994,0.22823750509152607,0.14029948517338994,-0.03182791619929441,6.034000000000005,0.19219263012749435,0.3912541590276371,0.19219263012749435,-0.1913945446193573,76.01240262804022,1.8674701783040033,2.4752246354640346,1.8674701783040033,0.6889622755114319,1.3589501365051335,0.6379068046234132,0.758190715654964,0.6379068046234132,0.3761118022337068,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.9786}",0.9786,1.146059838129971,0.5202252944188429,1.146059838129971,0.17182580122626404,0.2544871794871794,0.9393516756289381,0.7853905597997616,0.9393516756289381,0.27108853492767276,1.1414151797709906,1.9597602422318412,1.5034703452648595,1.9597602422318412,0.6028892313157511,55.20734929552105,0.9020739672734858,0.8120379200651549,0.9020739672734858,-0.34898149703730386,-0.9963,-0.8024974470870594,-0.058338529758193064,-0.8024974470870594,0.011072745129560035

As we peer and grope in the ill-lit, ill-paved, ill-ventilated courtyards that lay about Gerrard Street and Drury Lane at that time, we seem now to catch sight of her and then again to lose it. The task is made still more difficult by the fact that she found it convenient at this time to change frequently from one set of clothes to another. Thus she often occurs in contemporary memoirs as 'Lord' So-and-so, who was in fact her cousin; her bounty is ascribed to him, and it is he who is said to have written the poems that were really hers. She had, it seems, no difficulty in sustaining the different parts, for her sex changed far more frequently than those who have worn only one set of clothing can conceive; nor can there be any doubt that she reaped a twofold harvest by this device; the pleasures of life were increased and its experiences multiplied.

There was the little shadow with the pouting lips, fidgeting this way and that on his chair, uneasy, petulant, officious; there was the bent female shadow, crooking a finger in the cup to feel how deep the tea was, for she was blind; and there was the Roman-looking rolling shadow in the big armchair--he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast gulps. Dr Johnson, Mr Boswell, and Mrs Williams,--those were the shadows' names. So absorbed was she in the sight, that she forgot to think how other ages would have envied her, though it seems probable that on this occasion they would. She was content to gaze and gaze. At length Mr Boswell rose. He saluted the old woman with tart asperity. But with what humility did he not abase himself before the great Roman shadow, who now rose to its full height and rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent phrases that ever left human lips; so Orlando thought them, though she never heard a word that any of the three shadows said as they sat there drinking tea.",never was any play so absorbing  she wanted to cry out  bravo  bravo  for  to be sure  what a fine drama it was  what a page torn from the thickest volume of human life  there was the little shadow with the pouting lips  fidgeting this way and that on his chair  uneasy  petulant  officious  there was the bent female shadow  crooking a finger in the cup to feel how deep the tea was  for she was blind  and there was the roman looking rolling shadow in the big armchair  he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast gulps  dr johnson  mr boswell  and mrs williams   those were the shadows  names  so absorbed was she in the sight  that she forgot to think how other ages would have envied her  though it seems probable that on this occasion they would  she was content to gaze and gaze  at length mr boswell rose  he saluted the old woman with tart asperity  but with what humility did he not abase himself before the great roman shadow  who now rose to its full height and rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent phrases that ever left human lips  so orlando thought them  though she never heard a word that any of the three shadows said as they sat there drinking tea ,1267,232,-0.1499999999999999,-0.2585363281044269,-0.19649122807017544,-0.2585363281044269,-0.20083972088106414,-0.1499999999999999,-0.26768659272036094,-0.17931034482758618,-0.26768659272036094,-0.15927466154395864,-15.470699581361366,-0.19413308796338782,-0.2232775745504392,-0.19413308796338782,-0.13877588352763592,-1.989583333333333,-1.042383938490011,-1.083839797387492,-1.042383938490011,-0.693118568810215,7.570999999999998,0.44283210520573846,0.5999864195015956,0.44283210520573846,0.1411468709728567,12.93340502675422,-0.03767003025121752,0.16321091165595272,-0.03767003025121752,-0.09233713434496683,1.2581257387538478,0.5717375808321655,0.7019383777412842,0.5717375808321655,0.4757828293136064,"{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': 0.8267}",0.8267,0.9153852996127321,0.4005671747607231,0.9153852996127321,0.23887037974362255,0.1492777777777778,0.23556574049748358,0.2147765812133485,0.23556574049748358,0.15011799953399718,0.6817791589829428,0.8116935277211802,0.7015758044178668,0.8116935277211802,0.39279470295098834,42.59654286923742,0.4038343761903528,0.4477417928613795,0.4038343761903528,-0.23844010652095582,-0.9093,-0.7022749405405814,-0.010115707060209297,-0.7022749405405814,-0.05225041394496552
283,283,3,"At length she came home one night after one of these saunterings and mounted to her bedroom. She took off her laced coat and stood there in shirt and breeches looking out of the window. There was something stirring in the air which forbade her to go to bed. A white haze lay over the town, for it was a frosty night in midwinter and a magnificent vista lay all round her. She could see St Paul's, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, with all the spires and domes of the city churches, the smooth bulk of its banks, the opulent and ample curves of its halls and meeting-places. On the north rose the smooth, shorn heights of Hampstead, and in the west the streets and squares of Mayfair shone out in one clear radiance. Upon this serene and orderly prospect the stars looked down, glittering, positive, hard, from a cloudless sky. In the extreme clearness of the atmosphere the line of every roof, the cowl of every chimney, was perceptible; even the cobbles in the streets showed distinct one from another, and Orlando could not help comparing this orderly scene with the irregular and huddled purlieus which had been the city of London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Then, she remembered, the city, if such one could call it, lay crowded, a mere huddle and conglomeration of houses, under her windows at Blackfriars. The stars reflected themselves in deep pits of stagnant water which lay in the middle of the streets. A black shadow at the corner where the wine shop used to stand was, as likely as not, the corpse of a murdered man. She could remember the cries of many a one wounded in such night brawlings, when she was a little boy, held to the diamond-paned window in her nurse's arms. Troops of ruffians, men and women, unspeakably interlaced, lurched down the streets, trolling out wild songs with jewels flashing in their ears, and knives gleaming in their fists. On such a night as this the impermeable tangle of the forests on Highgate and Hampstead would be outlined, writhing in contorted intricacy against the sky. Here and there, on one of the hills which rose above London, was a stark gallows tree, with a corpse nailed to rot or parch on its cross; for danger and insecurity, lust and violence, poetry and filth swarmed over the tortuous Elizabethan highways and buzzed and stank--Orlando could remember even now the smell of them on a hot night--in the little rooms and narrow pathways of the city. Now--she leant out of her window--all was light, order, and serenity. There was the faint rattle of a coach on the cobbles. She heard the far-away cry of the night watchman--'Just twelve o'clock on a frosty morning'. No sooner had the words left his lips than the first stroke of midnight sounded. Orlando then for the first time noticed a small cloud gathered behind the dome of St Paul's. As the strokes sounded, the cloud increased, and she saw it darken and spread with extraordinary speed. At the same time a light breeze rose and by the time the sixth stroke of midnight had struck the whole of the eastern sky was covered with an irregular moving darkness, though the sky to the west and north stayed clear as ever. Then the cloud spread north. Height upon height above the city was engulfed by it. Only Mayfair, with all its lights shining. burnt more brilliantly than ever by contrast. With the eighth stroke, some hurrying tatters of cloud sprawled over Piccadilly. They seemed to mass themselves and to advance with extraordinary rapidity towards the west end. As the ninth, tenth, and eleventh strokes struck, a huge blackness sprawled over the whole of London. With the twelfth stroke of midnight, the darkness was complete. A turbulent welter of cloud covered the city. All was darkness; all was doubt; all was confusion. The Eighteenth century was over; the Nineteenth century had begun.",at length she came home one night after one of these saunterings and mounted to her bedroom  she took off her laced coat and stood

284,284,4,"The great cloud which hung, not only over London, but over the whole of the British Isles on the first day of the nineteenth century stayed, or rather, did not stay, for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales, long enough to have extraordinary consequences upon those who lived beneath its shadow. A change seemed to have come over the climate of England. Rain fell frequently, but only in fitful gusts, which were no sooner over than they began again. The sun shone, of course, but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so saturated with water, that its beams were discoloured and purples, oranges, and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more positive landscapes of the eighteenth century. Under this bruised and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense, and the white of the snow was muddied. But what was worse, damp now began to make its way into every house--damp, which is the most insidious of all enemies, for while the sun can be shut out by blinds, and the frost roasted by a hot fire, damp steals in while we sleep; damp is silent, imperceptible, ubiquitous. Damp swells the wood, furs the kettle, rusts the iron, rots the stone. So gradual is the process, that it is not until we pick up some chest of drawers, or coal scuttle, and the whole thing drops to pieces in our hands, that we suspect even that the disease is at work.",the great cloud which hung  not only over london  but over the whole of the british isles on the first day of the nineteenth century stayed  or rather  did not stay  for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales  long enough to have extraordinary consequences upon those who lived beneath its shadow  a change seemed to have come over the climate of england  rain fell frequently  but only in fitful gusts  which were no sooner over than they began again  the sun shone  of course  but it was so girt about with clouds and the air was so saturated with water  that its beams were discoloured and purples  oranges  and reds of a dull sort took the place of the more positive landscapes of the eighteenth century  under this bruised and sullen canopy the green of the cabbages was less intense  and the white of the snow was muddied  but what was worse  damp now began to make its way into every house  damp  which is the most insidious of all enemies  for while the sun can be shut out by blinds  and the frost roasted by a hot fire  damp steals in while we sleep  damp is silent  imperceptible  ubiquitous  damp swells the wood  furs the kettle  rusts the iron  rots the stone  so gradual is the process  that it is not until we pick up some chest of drawers  or coal scuttle  and the whole thing drops to pieces in our hands  that we suspect even that the disease is at work ,1387,254,-5.450000000000001,-1.6195826084071954,-1.6842105263157898,-1.6195826084071954,-0.8924273424123613,-5.45,-1.6527351634977432,-1.6413793103448275,-1.6527351634977432,-0.8103315637380938,-107.01296395833359,-1.5125631842860567,-1.5444417954348086,-1.5125631842860567,-0.8767882262960143,-3.5659404761904767,-1.7300246373062342,-1.8467132216068538,-1.7300246373062342,-1.0260339966753669,-1.4259999999999993,-1.024313865697952,-0.6218510219325049,-1.024313865697952,-0.794146165737926,-12.868966504483868,-0.8169648407197982,-0.7825149139840095,-0.8169648407197982,-0.544089212098495,-1.4181220104254735,-1.1846352831357843,-0.7912041163892141,-1.1846352831357843,-0.4898381241593439,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': -0.9674}",-0.9674,-1.8091254940263595,-1.0127220449801095,-1.8091254940263595,-0.7988338865668896,0.09384469696969695,-0.13524734255273974,-0.08587041678563903,-0.13524734255273974,-0.05785432889585431,0.40572253667132463,0.12216658670200202,0.21995928964426414,0.12216658670200202,-0.03292283443551187,43.429986569280125,0.43676285310635804,0.4718179940101921,0.43676285310635804,-0.3860794129737523,-0.9996,-0.8062989904388224,-0.06016767130880629,-0.8062989904388224,-0.05355819301779751
285,285,4,"Thus, stealthily and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it. Everywhere the effects were felt. The hardy country gentleman, who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a room designed, perhaps by the brothers Adam, with classic dignity, now felt chilly. Rugs appeared; beards were grown; trousers were fastened tight under the instep. The chill which he felt in his legs the country gentleman soon transferred to his house; furniture was muffled; walls and tables were covered; nothing was left bare. Then a change of diet became essential. The muffin was invented and the crumpet. Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and, as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces, and mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and china ornaments, the home--which had become extremely important--was completely altered.",thus  stealthily and imperceptibly  none marking the exact day or hour of the change  the constitution of england was altered and nobody knew it  everywhere the effects were felt  the hardy country gentleman  who had sat down gladly to a meal of ale and beef in a room designed  perhaps by the brothers adam  with classic dignity  now felt chilly  rugs appeared  beards were grown  trousers were fastened tight under the instep  the chill which he felt in his legs the country gentleman soon transferred to his house  furniture was muffled  walls and tables were covered  nothing was left bare  then a change of diet became essential  the muffin was invented and the crumpet  coffee supplanted the after dinner port  and  as coffee led to a drawing room in which to drink it  and a drawing room to glass cases  and glass cases to artificial flowers  and artificial flowers to mantelpieces  and mantelpieces to pianofortes  and pianofortes to drawing room ballads  and drawing room ballads  skipping a stage or two  to innumerable little dogs  mats  and china ornaments  the home  which had become extremely important  was completely altered ,1141,181,6.75,1.5133918481387998,1.7403508771929825,1.5133918481387998,1.0600069984990088,6.75,1.5354898484803818,1.7241379310344827,1.5354898484803818,1.0276797224047427,64.13913612666565,0.9524411646522046,0.9256744126410201,0.9524411646522046,0.7374567657782365,3.635416666666667,1.4113613617853775,1.6383624844229534,1.4113613617853775,1.053371284652159,1.042999999999999,-0.6216926139294502,-0.2865485163305494,-0.6216926139294502,-0.5159481948390644,52.505696668004205,1.1575100901900435,1.6136410839204616,1.1575100901900435,0.902499961440773,1.1243446554449479,0.48393948197975495,0.6272987183672274,0.48393948197975495,0.5449963418363225,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.8399}",0.8399,0.9354307499644605,0.41096537870731426,0.9354307499644605,0.3904672604032368,-0.07033068783068783,-1.2334792955910205,-0.9762924511743345,-1.2334792955910205,-0.6332802251097777,-0.2249067703064503,-1.453002642408459,-0.8802551750458149,-1.453002642408459,-0.934239990802921,35.229465870608365,0.11276897504164916,0.23492450515652932,0.11276897504164916,-0.1093931075359721,-0.9897,-0.7948943603835334,-0.05468024665696675,-0.7948943603835334,-0.17853551119379202
286,286,4,"Outside the house--it was another effect of the damp--ivy grew in unparalleled profusion. Houses that had been of bare stone were smothered in greenery. No garden, however formal its original design, lacked a shrubbery, a wilderness, a maze. What light penetrated to the bedrooms where children were born was naturally of an obfusc green, and what light penetrated to the drawing-rooms where grown men and women lived came through curtains of brown and purple plush. But the change did not stop at outward things. The damp struck within. Men felt the chill in their hearts; the damp in their minds. In a desperate effort to snuggle their feelings into some sort of warmth one subterfuge was tried after another. Love, birth, and death were all swaddled in a variety of fine phrases. The sexes drew further and further apart. No open conversation was tolerated. Evasions and concealments were sedulously practised on both sides. And just as the ivy and the evergreen rioted in the damp earth outside, so did the same fertility show itself within. The life of the average woman was a succession of childbirths. She married at nineteen and had fifteen or eighteen children by the time she was thirty; for twins abounded. Thus the British Empire came into existence; and thus--for there is no stopping damp; it gets into the inkpot as it gets into the woodwork--sentences swelled, adjectives multiplied, lyrics became epics, and little trifles that had been essays a column long were now encyclopaedias in ten or twenty volumes. But Eusebius Chubb shall be our witness to the effect this all had upon the mind of a sensitive man who could do nothing to stop it. There is a passage towards the end of his memoirs where he describes how, after writing thirty-five folio pages one morning 'all about nothing' he screwed the lid of his inkpot and went for a turn in his garden. Soon he found himself involved in the shrubbery. Innumerable leaves creaked and glistened above his head. He seemed to himself 'to crush the mould of a million more under his feet'. Thick smoke exuded from a damp bonfire at the end of the garden. He reflected that no fire on earth could ever hope to consume that vast vegetable encumbrance. Wherever he looked, vegetation was rampant. Cucumbers 'came scrolloping across the grass to his feet'. Giant cauliflowers towered deck above deck till they rivalled, to his disordered imagination, the elm trees themselves. Hens laid incessantly eggs of no special tint. Then, remembering with a sigh his own fecundity and his poor wife Jane, now in the throes of her fifteenth confinement indoors, how, he asked himself, could he blame the fowls? He looked upwards into the sky. Did not heaven itself, or that great frontispiece of heaven, which is the sky, indicate the assent, indeed, the instigation of the heavenly hierarchy? For there, winter or summer, year in year out, the clouds turned and tumbled, like whales, he pondered, or elephants rather; but no, there was no escaping the simile which was pressed upon him from a thousand airy acres; the whole sky itself as it spread wide above the British Isles was nothing but a vast feather bed; and the undistinguished fecundity of the garden, the bedroom and the henroost was copied there. He went indoors, wrote the passage quoted above, laid his head in a gas oven, and when they found him later he was past revival.",outside the house  it was another effect of the damp  ivy grew in unparalleled profusion  houses that had been of bare stone were smothered in greenery  no garden  however formal its original design  lacked a shrubbery  a wilderness  a maze  what light penetrated to the bedrooms where children were born was naturally of an obfusc green  and what light penetrated to the drawing rooms where grown men and women lived came through curtains of brown and purple plush  but the change did not stop at outward things  the damp struck within  men felt the chill in their hearts  the damp in their minds  in a desperate effort to snuggle their feelings into some sort of warmth one subterfuge was tried after another  love  birth  and death were all swaddled in a variety of fine phrases  the sexes drew further and further apart  no open conversation was tolerated  evasions and concealments were sedulously practised on both sides  and just as the ivy and the evergreen rioted in the damp earth outside  so did the same fertility show itself within  the life of the average woman was a succession of childbirths  she married at nineteen and had fifteen or eighteen children by the time she was thirty  for twins abounded  thus the british empire came into existence  and thus  for there is no stopping damp  it gets into the inkpot as it gets into the woodwork  sentences swelled  adjectives multiplied  lyrics became epics  and little trifles that had been essays a column long were now encyclopaedias in ten or twenty volumes  but eusebius chubb shall be our witness to the effect this all had upon the mind of a sensitive man who could do nothing to stop it  there is a passage towards the end of his memoirs where he describes how  after writing thirty five folio pages one morning  about nothing  he screwed the lid of his inkpot and went for a turn in his garden  soon he found himself involved in the shrubbery  innumerable leaves creaked and glistened above his head  he seemed to himself  to crush the mould of a million more under his feet   thick smoke exuded from a damp bonfire at the end of the garden  he reflected that no fire on earth could ever hope to consume that vast vegetable encumbrance  wherever he looked  vegetation was rampant  cucumbers  came scrolloping across the grass to his feet   giant cauliflowers towered deck above deck till they rivalled  to his disordered imagination  the elm trees themselves  hens laid incessantly eggs of no special tint  then  remembering with a sigh his own fecundity and his poor wife jane  now in the throes of her fifteenth confinement indoors  how  he asked himself  could he blame the fowls  he looked upwards into the sky  did not heaven itself  or that great frontispiece of heaven  which is the sky  indicate the assent  indeed  the instigation of the heavenly hierarchy  for there  winter or summer  year in year out  the clouds turned and tumbled  like whales  he pondered  or elephants rather  but no  there was no escaping the simile which was pressed upon him from a thousand airy acres  the whole sky itself as it spread wide above the british isles was nothing but a vast feather bed  and the undistinguished fecundity of the garden  the bedroom and the henroost was copied there  he went indoors  wrote the passage quoted above  laid his head in a gas oven  and when they found him later he was past revival ,3386,579,1.1500000000000012,0.07530521234719584,0.16842105263157928,0.07530521234719584,-0.1133455140521559,1.1500000000000004,0.07204230199861968,0.17931034482758632,0.07204230199861968,-0.07690808139633509,-13.568703328986196,-0.16673973999137545,-0.1958274189966473,-0.16673973999137545,-0.04876989452132549,-2.520833333333333,-1.2741265501826866,-1.3409366795584785,-1.2741265501826866,-0.43584481940718245,16.229000000000003,1.854697150896987,1.7757859713451492,1.854697150896987,0.028556532642058617,79.41404174427689,1.9702080102571953,2.5999037936506135,1.9702080102571953,0.2532706993598915,-0.9273712249885444,-0.8625644424310339,-0.5174025402875619,-0.8625644424310339,-0.1405231106075022,"{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.0617}",-0.0617,-0.43373425284753697,-0.2992634605537831,-0.43373425284753697,-0.2777173589430623,0.056889880952380956,-0.3824522436907096,-0.2862986508878888,-0.3824522436907096,-0.2637319272234756,0.44065096486235167,0.20940989223654666,0.28089645431366794,0.20940989223654666,-0.29833649897792053,89.33676134056311,2.250490850890716,1.7979552525076876,2.250490850890716,-0.5812999105645632,-0.9996,-0.8062989904388224,-0.06016767130880629,-0.8062989904388224,0.12658655476791755
287,287,4,"While this went on in every part of England, it was all very well for Orlando to mew herself in her house at Blackfriars and pretend that the climate was the same; that one could still say what one liked and wear knee-breeches or skirts as the fancy took one. Even she, at length, was forced to acknowledge that times were changed. One afternoon in the early part of the century she was driving through St James's Park in her old panelled coach when one of those sunbeams, which occasionally, though not often, managed to come to earth, struggled through, marbling the clouds with strange prismatic colours as it passed. Such a sight was sufficiently strange after the clear and uniform skies of the eighteenth century to cause her to pull the window down and look at it. The puce and flamingo clouds made her think with a pleasurable anguish, which proves that she was insensibly afflicted with the damp already, of dolphins dying in Ionian seas. But what was her surprise when, as it struck the earth, the sunbeam seemed to call forth, or to light up, a pyramid, hecatomb, or trophy (for it had something of a banquet-table air)--a conglomeration at any rate of the most heterogeneous and ill-assorted objects, piled higgledy-piggledy in a vast mound where the statue of Queen Victoria now stands! Draped about a vast cross of fretted and floriated gold were widow's weeds and bridal veils; hooked on to other excrescences were crystal palaces, bassinettes, military helmets, memorial wreaths, trousers, whiskers, wedding cakes, cannon, Christmas trees, telescopes, extinct monsters, globes, maps, elephants, and mathematical instruments--the whole supported like a gigantic coat of arms on the right side by a female figure clothed in flowing white; on the left by a portly gentleman wearing a frock-coat and sponge-bag trousers. The incongruity of the objects, the association of the fully clothed and the partly draped, the garishness of the different colours and their plaid-like juxtapositions afflicted Orlando with the most profound dismay. She had never, in all her life, seen anything at once so indecent, so hideous, and so monumental. It might, and indeed it must be, the effect of the sun on the water-logged air; it would vanish with the first breeze that blew; but for all that, it looked, as she drove past, as if it were destined to endure for ever. Nothing, she felt, sinking back into the corner of her coach, no wind, rain, sun, or thunder, could ever demolish that garish erection. Only the noses would mottle and the trumpets would rust; but there they would remain, pointing east, west, south, and north, eternally. She looked back as her coach swept up Constitution Hill. Yes, there it was, still beaming placidly in a light which--she pulled her watch out of her fob--was, of course, the light of twelve o'clock mid-day. None other could be so prosaic, so matter-of-fact, so impervious to any hint of dawn or sunset, so seemingly calculated to last for ever. She was determined not to look again. Already she felt the tides of her blood run sluggishly.

296,296,4,"At length the colour on her cheeks resumed its stability and it seemed as if the spirit of the age--if such indeed it were--lay dormant for a time. Then Orlando felt in the bosom of her shirt as if for some locket or relic of lost affection, and drew out no such thing, but a roll of paper, sea-stained, blood-stained, travel-stained--the manuscript of her poem, 'The Oak Tree'. She had carried this about with her for so many years now, and in such hazardous circumstances, that many of the pages were stained, some were torn, while the straits she had been in for writing paper when with the gipsies, had forced her to overscore the margins and cross the lines till the manuscript looked like a piece of darning most conscientiously carried out. She turned back to the first page and read the date,     , written in her own boyish hand. She had been working at it for close three hundred years now. It was time to make an end. Meanwhile she began turning and dipping and reading and skipping and thinking as she read, how very little she had changed all these years. She had been a gloomy boy, in love with death, as boys are; and then she had been amorous and florid; and then she had been sprightly and satirical; and sometimes she had tried prose and sometimes she had tried drama.

Orlando, who had just dipped her pen in the ink, and was about to indite some reflection upon the eternity of all things, was much annoyed to be impeded by a blot, which spread and meandered round her pen. It was some infirmity of the quill, she supposed; it was split or dirty. She dipped it again. The blot increased. She tried to go on with what she was saying; no words came. Next she began to decorate the blot with wings and whiskers, till it became a round-headed monster, something between a bat and a wombat. But as for writing poetry with Basket and Bartholomew in the room, it was impossible. No sooner had she said 'Impossible' than, to her astonishment and alarm, the pen began to curve and caracole with the smoothest possible fluency.

305,305,4,"Meanwhile, she became conscious, as she stood at the window, of an extraordinary tingling and vibration all over her, as if she were made of a thousand wires upon which some breeze or errant fingers were playing scales. Now her toes tingled; now her marrow. She had the queerest sensations about the thigh bones. Her hairs seemed to erect themselves. Her arms sang and twanged as the telegraph wires would be singing and twanging in twenty years or so. But all this agitation seemed at length to concentrate in her hands; and then in one hand, and then in one finger of that hand, and then finally to contract itself so that it made a ring of quivering sensibility about the second finger of the left hand. And when she raised it to see what caused this agitation, she saw nothing--nothing but the vast solitary emerald which Queen Elizabeth had given her. And was that not enough? she asked. It was of the finest water. It was worth ten thousand pounds at least. The vibration seemed, in the oddest way (but remember we are dealing with some of the darkest manifestations of the human soul) to say No, that is not enough; and, further, to assume a note of interrogation, as though it were asking, what did it mean, this hiatus, this strange oversight? till poor Orlando felt positively ashamed of the second finger of her left hand without in the least knowing why. At this moment, Bartholomew came in to ask which dress she should lay out for dinner, and Orlando, whose senses were much quickened, instantly glanced at Bartholomew's left hand, and instantly perceived what she had never noticed before--a thick ring of rather jaundiced yellow circling the third finger where her own was bare.",meanwhile  she became conscious  as she stood at the window  of an extraordinary tingling and vibration all over her  as if she were made of a thousand wires upon which some breeze or errant fingers were playing scales  now her toes tingled  now her marrow  she had the queerest sensations about the thigh bones  her hairs seemed to erect themselves  her arms sang and twanged as the telegraph wires would be singing and twanging in twenty years or so  but all this agitation seemed at length to concentrate in her hands  and then in one hand  and then in one finger of that hand  and then finally to contract itself so that it made a ring of quivering sensibility about the second finger of the left hand  and when she raised it to see what caused this agitation  she saw nothing  nothing but the vast solitary emerald which queen elizabeth had given her  and was that not enough  she asked  it was of the finest water  it was worth ten thousand pounds at least  the vibration seemed  in the oddest way  but remember we are dealing with some of the darkest manifestations of the human soul  to say no  that is not enough  and  further  to assume a note of interrogation  as though it were asking  what did it mean  this hiatus  this strange oversight  till poor orlando felt positively ashamed of the second finger of her left hand without in the least knowing why  at this moment  bartholomew came in to ask which dress she should lay out for dinner  and orlando  whose senses were much quickened  instantly glanced at bartholomew own left hand  and instantly perceived what she had never noticed before  a thick ring of rather jaundiced yellow circling the third finger where her own was bare ,1694,297,-7.15,-2.0561446228439326,-2.16140350877193,-2.0561446228439326,-0.9794112987007727,-3.1499999999999995,-1.051676349764162,-1.0068965517241377,-1.051676349764162,-0.4708634653426463,-14.916951792223603,-0.1861577799901778,-0.21528572759994288,-0.1861577799901778,-0.10452391543950332,-0.3958333333333328,-0.34715610341198416,-0.31254915087453233,-0.34715610341198416,-0.2517566859952534,5.917000000000001,0.17311337275328756,0.37536497589461554,0.17311337275328756,-0.1696832800537185,6.367892586476321,-0.23596458494287179,-0.07743265344479841,-0.23596458494287179,-0.23797894237618752,-0.3446028531795507,-0.48010412853147866,-0.19226215653568907,-0.48010412853147866,-0.10179703339738234,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.802}",0.802,0.8778760099394222,0.3811099294970263,0.8778760099394222,0.11738879349718172,0.024936868686868684,-0.59619816612894,-0.4595990894457017,-0.59619816612894,-0.27458169136473326,0.13093009121791502,-0.5642027267455259,-0.2594517049450751,-0.5642027267455259,-0.3999641688403866,50.312016564214396,0.7086645614183137,0.6706234303722509,0.7086645614183137,-0.40460183500072927,-0.9988,-0.8053774041717282,-0.059724243054112176,-0.8053774041717282,-0.006873222276442318

307,307,4,"At this, Bartholomew made as if she had been struck in the breast by a rogue. She started back a pace or two, clenched her hand and flung it away from her with a gesture that was noble in the extreme. 'No,' she said, with resolute dignity, her Ladyship might look if she pleased, but as for taking off her wedding ring, not the Archbishop nor the Pope nor Queen Victoria on her throne could force her to do that. Her Thomas had put it on her finger twenty-five years, six months, three weeks ago; she had slept in it; worked in it; washed in it; prayed in it; and proposed to be buried in it. In fact, Orlando understood her to say, but her voice was much broken with emotion; that it was by the gleam on her wedding ring that she would be assigned her station among the angels and its lustre would be tarnished for ever if she let it out of her keeping for a second.",at this  bartholomew made as if she had been struck in the breast by a rogue  she started back a pace or two  clenched her hand and flung it away from her with a gesture that was noble in the extreme   no   she said  with resolute dignity  her ladyship might look if she pleased  but as for taking off her wedding ring  not the archbishop nor the pope nor queen victoria on her throne could force her to do that  her thomas had put it on her finger twenty five years  six months  three weeks ago  she had slept in it  worked in it  washed in it  prayed in it  and proposed to be buried in it  in fact  orlando understood her to say  but her voice was much broken with emotion  that it was by the gleam on her wedding ring that she would be assigned her station among the angels and its lustre would be tarnished for ever if she let it out of her keeping for a second ,867,170,-0.6000000000000001,-0.37409686133768083,-0.3228070175438597,-0.37409686133768083,-0.29664639035691237,-0.6000000000000001,-0.38528505627693116,-0.303448275862069,-0.38528505627693116,-0.24946654973937282,16.282233482835796,0.26318597534883414,0.23498986462715732,0.26318597534883414,0.19932285069368777,0.20833333333333376,-0.08360568227129438,-0.020164461346743833,-0.08360568227129438,-0.09586593949075647,6.07,0.19806317085801847,0.3961431384531814,0.19806317085801847,0.2162744704047413,6.604294146864366,-0.22882467886974042,-0.06876790491151381,-0.22882467886974042,-0.16407670700565846,0.7631165100319559,0.24687200102646728,0.4257609144933196,0.24687200102646728,0.39383529139830753,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': 0.0516}",0.0516,-0.2616774706618678,-0.21001221001221002,-0.2616774706618678,-0.21999173079188664,0.09583333333333333,-0.12194459317788825,-0.07508484354808334,-0.12194459317788825,0.08960751517733466,0.15043684268196442,-0.5154792780790989,-0.22541965175250456,-0.5154792780790989,-0.25902407546820755,32.43245167635813,0.0022619098081022746,0.15412543456135652,0.0022619098081022746,-0.15453095495004457,-0.9689,-0.770933117439088,-0.043151112034920024,-0.770933117439088,-0.19741075854635454
308,308,4,"'Heaven help us,' said Orlando, standing at the window and watching the pigeons at their pranks, 'what a world we live in! What a world to be sure!' Its complexities amazed her. It now seemed to her that the whole world was ringed with gold. She went in to dinner. Wedding rings abounded. She went to church. Wedding rings were everywhere. She drove out. Gold, or pinchbeck, thin, thick, plain, smooth, they glowed dully on every hand. Rings filled the jewellers' shops, not the flashing pastes and diamonds of Orlando's recollection, but simple bands without a stone in them. At the same time, she began to notice a new habit among the town people. In the old days, one would meet a boy trifling with a girl under a hawthorn hedge frequently enough. Orlando had flicked many a couple with the tip of her whip and laughed and passed on. Now, all that was changed. Couples trudged and plodded in the middle of the road indissolubly linked together. The woman's right hand was invariably passed through the man's left and her fingers were firmly gripped by his. Often it was not till the horses' noses were on them that they budged, and then, though they moved it was all in one piece, heavily, to the side of the road. Orlando could only suppose that some new discovery had been made about the race; that they were somehow stuck together, couple after couple, but who had made it and when, she could not guess. It did not seem to be Nature. She looked at the doves and the rabbits and the elk-hounds and she could not see that Nature had changed her ways or mended them, since the time of Elizabeth at least. There was no indissoluble alliance among the brutes that she could see. Could it be Queen Victoria then, or Lord Melbourne? Was it from them that the great discovery of marriage proceeded? Yet the Queen, she pondered, was said to be fond of dogs, and Lord Melbourne, she had heard, was said to be fond of women. It was strange--it was distasteful; indeed, there was something in this indissolubility of bodies which was repugnant to her sense of decency and sanitation. Her ruminations, however, were accompanied by such a tingling and twanging of the afflicted finger that she could scarcely keep her ideas in order. They were languishing and ogling like a housemaid's fancies. They made her blush. There was nothing for it but to buy one of those ugly bands and wear it like the rest. This she did, slipping it, overcome with shame, upon her finger in the shadow of a curtain; but without avail. The tingling persisted more violently, more indignantly than ever. She did not sleep a wink that night. Next morning when she took up the pen to write, either she could think of nothing, and the pen made one large lachrymose blot after another, or it ambled off, more alarmingly still, into mellifluous fluencies about early death and corruption, which were worse than no thinking at all. For it would seem--her case proved it--that we write, not with the fingers, but with the whole person. The nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every fibre of our being, threads the heart, pierces the liver. Though the seat of her trouble seemed to be the left hand, she could feel herself poisoned through and through, and was forced at length to consider the most desperate of remedies, which was to yield completely and submissively to the spirit of the age, and take a husband.", heaven help us   said orlando  standing at the window and watching the pigeons at their pranks   what a world we live in  what a world to be sure   its complexities amazed her  it now seemed to her that the whole world was ringed with gold  she went in to dinner  wedding rings abounded  she went to church  wedding rings were everywhere  she drove out  gold  or pinchbeck  thin  thick  plain  smooth  they glowed dully on every hand  rings filled the jewellers  shops  not the flashing pastes and diamonds of orlando own recollection  but simple bands without a stone in them  at the same time  she began to notice a new habit among the town people  in the old days  one would meet a boy trifling with a girl under a hawthorn hedge frequently enough  orlando had flicked many a couple with the tip of her whip and laughed and passed on  now  all that was changed  couples trudged and plodded in the middle of the road indissolubly linked together  the woman own right hand was invariably passed through the man own left and her fingers were firmly gripped by his  often it was not till the horses  noses were on them that they budged  and then  though they moved it was all in one piece  heavily  to the side of the road  orlando could only suppose that some new discovery had been made about the race  that they were somehow stuck together  couple after couple  but who had made it and when  she could not guess  it did not seem to be nature  she looked at the doves and the rabbits and the elk hounds and she could not see that nature had changed her ways or mended them  since the time of elizabeth at least  there was no indissoluble alliance among the brutes that she could see  could it be queen victoria then  or lord melbourne  was it from them that the great discovery of marriage proceeded  yet the queen  she pondered  was said to be fond of dogs  and lord melbourne  she had heard  was said to be fond of women  it was strange  it was distasteful  indeed  there was something in this indissolubility of bodies which was repugnant to her sense of decency and sanitation  her ruminations  however  were accompanied by such a tingling and twanging of the afflicted finger that she could scarcely keep her ideas in order  they were languishing and ogling like a housemaid own fancies  they made her blush  there was nothing for it but to buy one of those ugly bands and wear it like the rest  this she did  slipping it  overcome with shame  upon her finger in the shadow of a curtain  but without avail  the tingling persisted more violently  more indignantly than ever  she did not sleep a wink that night  next morning when she took up the pen to write  either she could think of nothing  and the pen made one large lachrymose blot after another  or it ambled off  more alarmingly still  into mellifluous fluencies about early death and corruption  which were worse than no thinking at all  for it would seem  her case proved it  that we write  not with the fingers  but with the whole person  the nerve which controls the pen winds itself about every fibre of our being  threads the heart  pierces the liver  though the seat of her trouble seemed to be the left hand  she could feel herself poisoned through and through  and was forced at length to consider the most desperate of remedies  which was to yield completely and submissively to the spirit of the age  and take a husband ,3387,602,-2.7000000000000024,-0.9133793497595329,-0.9122807017543867,-0.9133793497595329,-0.32840530315329636,0.3000000000000008,-0.15008812916379055,-0.05517241379310322,-0.15008812916379055,-0.12345611917688633,-67.44490026704717,-0.9426873309973848,-0.9733841490636347,-0.9426873309973848,-0.23315495987583382,9.588523809523812,4.008234014909211,4.519351257427004,4.008234014909211,0.8000355252509481,14.02499999999999,1.4952896017281805,1.4764717865145638,1.4952896017281805,-0.08715796369875363,-30.462805025120083,-1.348341851501726,-1.4273760826932744,-1.348341851501726,-0.5438236427496772,-1.3817543119844908,-1.1607678221780688,-0.7709137094294674,-1.1607678221780688,-0.2013756890745573,"{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.9682}",-0.9682,-1.810340369805252,-1.0133522391586909,-1.810340369805252,-0.4891063641790933,0.0988501082251082,-0.10176423188134506,-0.05872305557546501,-0.10176423188134506,-0.21367107683920705,0.629692696999638,0.681593338495079,0.6107042285895943,0.681593338495079,-0.20790175854923595,91.50284110475073,2.3360703657513158,1.8605281318806812,2.3360703657513158,-0.6081669943082613,-0.9999,-0.8066445852889826,-0.06033395690431656,-0.8066445852889826,0.1319249370110482
309,309,4,"That this was much against her natural temperament has been sufficiently made plain. When the sound of the Archduke's chariot wheels died away, the cry that rose to her lips was 'Life! A Lover!' not 'Life! A Husband!' and it was in pursuit of this aim that she had gone to town and run about the world as has been shown in the previous chapter. Such is the indomitable nature of the spirit of the age, however, that it batters down anyone who tries to make stand against it far more effectually than those who bend its own way. Orlando had inclined herself naturally to the Elizabethan spirit, to the Restoration spirit, to the spirit of the eighteenth century, and had in consequence scarcely been aware of the change from one age to the other. But the spirit of the nineteenth century was antipathetic to her in the extreme, and thus it took her and broke her, and she was aware of her defeat at its hands as she had never been before. For it is probable that the human spirit has its place in time assigned to it; some are born of this age, some of that; and now that Orlando was grown a woman, a year or two past thirty indeed, the lines of her character were fixed, and to bend them the wrong way was intolerable.",that this was much against her natural temperament has been sufficiently made plain  when the sound of the archduke own chariot wheels died away  the cry that rose to her lips was  life  a lover   not  life  a husband   and it was in pursuit of this aim that she had gone to town and run about the world as has been shown in the previous chapter  such is the indomitable nature of the spirit of the age  however  that it batters down anyone who tries to make stand against it far more effectually than those who bend its own way  orlando had inclined herself naturally to the elizabethan spirit  to the restoration spirit  to the spirit of the eighteenth century  and had in consequence scarcely been aware of the change from one age to the other  but the spirit of the nineteenth century was antipathetic to her in the extreme  and thus it took her and broke her  and she was aware of her defeat at its hands as she had never been before  for it is probable that the human spirit has its place in time assigned to it  some are born of this age  some of that  and now that orlando was grown a woman  a year or two past thirty indeed  the lines of her character were fixed  and to bend them the wrong way was intolerable ,1218,229,0.9500000000000002,0.023944975354638267,0.11228070175438601,0.023944975354638267,-0.04148574261429698,0.9500000000000002,0.019776318195699548,0.12413793103448281,0.019776318195699548,-0.009259675427007235,-46.59774842851022,-0.6424379042042055,-0.6725120731556322,-0.6424379042042055,-0.4234688632246455,4.018750000000001,1.578579560026367,1.8238755288129986,1.578579560026367,0.8988341773328247,1.9369999999999985,-0.4759075191214143,-0.16513886059618405,-0.4759075191214143,-0.4500194534504603,12.954979437396734,-0.037018430213900264,0.16400167142363084,-0.037018430213900264,-0.08883678147514236,-0.18056801721650254,-0.37245104046469546,-0.10074320647986539,-0.37245104046469546,-0.0691796003955211,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.8201}",-0.8201,-1.5854364912377534,-0.8966875418488323,-1.5854364912377534,-0.7668190510165701,0.0940648723257419,-0.13377450536966176,-0.08467627316483883,-0.13377450536966176,-0.02650619174498351,0.3971109708238948,0.10065684494525223,0.2049352982056498,0.10065684494525223,0.010486528080609896,42.252916028661595,0.3902580440553315,0.43781523281489937,0.3902580440553315,-0.2278567758831568,-0.9953,-0.8013454642531916,-0.05778424443982544,-0.8013454642531916,-0.08706345358294083
310,310,4,"So she stood mournfully at the drawing-room window (Bartholomew had so christened the library) dragged down by the weight of the crinoline which she had submissively adopted. It was heavier and more drab than any dress she had yet worn. None had ever so impeded her movements. No longer could she stride through the garden with her dogs, or run lightly to the high mound and fling herself beneath the oak tree. Her skirts collected damp leaves and straw. The plumed hat tossed on the breeze. The thin shoes were quickly soaked and mud-caked. Her muscles had lost their pliancy. She became nervous lest there should be robbers behind the wainscot and afraid, for the first time in her life, of ghosts in the corridors. All these things inclined her, step by step, to submit to the new discovery, whether Queen Victoria's or another's, that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life, whom it supports, by whom it is supported, till death them do part. It would be a comfort, she felt, to lean; to sit down; yes, to lie down; never, never, never to get up again. Thus did the spirit work upon her, for all her past pride, and as she came sloping down the scale of emotion to this lowly and unaccustomed lodging-place, those twangings and tinglings which had been so captious and so interrogative modulated into the sweetest melodies, till it seemed as if angels were plucking harp-strings with white fingers and her whole being was pervaded by a seraphic harmony.",so she stood mournfully at the drawing room window  bartholomew had so christened the library  dragged down by the weight of the crinoline which she had submissively adopted  it was heavier and more drab than any dress she had yet worn  none had ever so impeded her movements  no longer could she stride through the garden with her dogs  or run lightly to the high mound and fling herself beneath the oak tree  her skirts collected damp leaves and straw  the plumed hat tossed on the breeze  the thin shoes were quickly soaked and mud caked  her muscles had lost their pliancy  she became nervous lest there should be robbers behind the wainscot and afraid  for the first time in her life  of ghosts in the corridors  all these things inclined her  step by step  to submit to the new discovery  whether queen victoria own or another own  that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life  whom it supports  by whom it is supported  till death them do part  it would be a comfort  she felt  to lean  to sit down  yes  to lie down  never  never  never to get up again  thus did the spirit work upon her  for all her past pride  and as she came sloping down the scale of emotion to this lowly and unaccustomed lodging place  those twangings and tinglings which had been so captious and so interrogative modulated into the sweetest melodies  till it seemed as if angels were plucking harp strings with white fingers and her whole being was pervaded by a seraphic harmony ,1478,260,2.2,0.34494645655812134,0.46315789473684216,0.34494645655812134,0.10185127822945854,1.2000000000000004,0.08510879794934971,0.19310344827586218,0.08510879794934971,0.005347958821651188,-30.378994780208323,-0.4088486099006734,-0.4384383677113904,-0.4088486099006734,-0.24315997179027904,-1.5375000000000005,-0.8451755199123228,-0.8650553917753195,-0.8451755199123228,-0.5308864172993558,2.4910000000000005,-0.38556642010166914,-0.0899028994364092,-0.38556642010166914,-0.42257639871554453,12.834090375937965,-0.04066957592828473,0.15957076446918592,-0.04066957592828473,-0.11944561246163882,-0.17594803368744646,-0.3694190290580903,-0.0981656074023764,-0.3694190290580903,-0.059372286161378324,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': -0.5129}",-0.5129,-1.1189241921429822,-0.6546929772736224,-1.1189241921429822,-0.5403983320110085,0.04776182881446039,-0.4435132763117232,-0.3358055776694867,-0.4435132763117232,-0.19887123445984903,0.16223748034838723,-0.4860039569508878,-0.2048319116815812,-0.4860039569508878,-0.34183748025758953,47.3300210619231,0.5908490808336034,0.5844806908754608,0.5908490808336034,-0.2567727477789846,-0.8747,-0.6624163344887637,0.009062564955310671,-0.6624163344887637,-0.00697661195164308

315,315,4,"At every step she glanced nervously lest some male form should be hiding behind a furze bush or some savage cow be lowering its horns to toss her. But there were only the rooks flaunting in the sky. A steel-blue plume from one of them fell among the heather. She loved wild birds' feathers. She had used to collect them as a boy. She picked it up and stuck it in her hat. The air blew upon her spirit somewhat and revived it. As the rooks went whirling and wheeling above her head and feather after feather fell gleaming through the purplish air, she followed them, her long cloak floating behind her, over the moor, up the hill. She had not walked so far for years. Six feathers had she picked from the grass and drawn between her fingers and pressed to her lips to feel their smooth, glinting plumage, when she saw, gleaming on the hill-side, a silver pool, mysterious as the lake into which Sir Bedivere flung the sword of Arthur. A single feather quivered in the air and fell into the middle of it. Then, some strange ecstasy came over her. Some wild notion she had of following the birds to the rim of the world and flinging herself on the spongy turf and there drinking forgetfulness, while the rooks' hoarse laughter sounded over her. She quickened her pace; she ran; she tripped; the tough heather roots flung her to the ground. Her ankle was broken. She could not rise. But there she lay content. The scent of the bog myrtle and the meadow-sweet was in her nostrils. The rooks' hoarse laughter was in her ears. 'I have found my mate,' she murmured. 'It is the moor. I am nature's bride,' she whispered, giving herself in rapture to the cold embraces of the grass as she lay folded in her cloak in the hollow by the pool. 'Here will I lie. (A feather fell upon her brow.) I have found a greener laurel than the bay. My forehead will be cool always. These are wild birds' feathers--the owl's, the nightjar's. I shall dream wild dreams. My hands shall wear no wedding ring,' she continued, slipping it from her finger. 'The roots shall twine about them. Ah!' she sighed, pressing her head luxuriously on its spongy pillow, 'I have sought happiness through many ages and not found it; fame and missed it; love and not known it; life--and behold, death is better. I have known many men and many women,' she continued; 'none have I understood. It is better that I should lie at peace here with only the sky above me--as the gipsy told me years ago. That was in Turkey.' And she looked straight up into the marvellous golden foam into which the clouds had churned themselves, and saw next moment a track in it, and camels passing in single file through the rocky desert among clouds of red dust; and then, when the camels had passed, there were only mountains, very high and full of clefts and with pinnacles of rock, and she fancied she heard goat bells ringing in their passes, and in their folds were fields of irises and gentian. So the sky changed and her eyes slowly lowered themselves down and down till they came to the rain-darkened earth and saw the great hump of the South Downs, flowing in one wave along the coast; and where the land parted, there was the sea, the sea with ships passing; and she fancied she heard a gun far out at sea, and thought at first, 'That's the Armada,' and then thought 'No, it's Nelson', and then remembered how those wars were over and the ships were busy merchant ships; and the sails on the winding river were those of pleasure boats. She saw, too, cattle sprinkled on the dark fields, sheep and cows, and she saw the lights coming here and there in farm-house windows, and lanterns moving among the cattle as the shepherd went his rounds and the cowman; and then the lights went out and the stars rose and tangled themselves about the sky. Indeed, she was falling asleep with the wet feathers on her face and her ear pressed to the ground when she heard, deep within, some hammer on an anvil, or was it a heart beating? Tick-tock, tick-tock, so it hammered, so it beat, the anvil, or the heart in the middle of the earth; until, as she listened, she thought it changed to the trot of a horse's hoofs; one, two, three, four, she counted; then she heard a stumble; then, as it came nearer and nearer, she could hear the crack of a twig and the suck of the wet bog in its hoofs. The horse was almost on her. She sat upright. Towering dark against the yellow-slashed sky of dawn, with the plovers rising and falling about him, she saw a man on horseback. He started.

358,358,5,"This method of writing biography, though it has its merits, is a little bare, perhaps, and the reader, if we go on with it, may complain that he could recite the calendar for himself and so save his pocket whatever sum the Hogarth Press may think proper to charge for this book. But what can the biographer do when his subject has put him in the predicament into which Orlando has now put us? Life, it has been agreed by everyone whose opinion is worth consulting, is the only fit subject for novelist or biographer; life, the same authorities have decided, has nothing whatever to do with sitting still in a chair and thinking. Thought and life are as the poles asunder. Therefore--since sitting in a chair and thinking is precisely what Orlando is doing now--there is nothing for it but to recite the calendar, tell one's beads, blow one's nose, stir the fire, look out of the window, until she has done. Orlando sat so still that you could have heard a pin drop. Would, indeed, that a pin had dropped! That would have been life of a kind. Or if a butterfly had fluttered through the window and settled on her chair, one could write about that. Or suppose she had got up and killed a wasp. Then, at once, we could out with our pens and write. For there would be blood shed, if only the blood of a wasp. Where there is blood there is life. And if killing a wasp is the merest trifle compared with killing a man, still it is a fitter subject for novelist or biographer than this mere wool-gathering; this thinking; this sitting in a chair day in, day out, with a cigarette and a sheet of paper and a pen and an ink pot. If only subjects, we might complain (for our patience is wearing thin), had more consideration for their biographers! What is more irritating than to see one's subject, on whom one has lavished so much time and trouble, slipping out of one's grasp altogether and indulging--witness her sighs and gasps, her flushing, her palings, her eyes now bright as lamps, now haggard as dawns--what is more humiliating than to see all this dumb show of emotion and excitement gone through before our eyes when we know that what causes it--thought and imagination--are of no importance whatsoever?",this method of writing biography  though it has its merits  is a little bare  perhaps  and the reader  if we go on with it  may complain that he could recite the calendar for himself and so save his pocket whatever sum the hogarth press may think proper to charge for this book  but what can the biographer do when his subject has put him in the predicament into which orlando has now put us  life  it has been agreed by everyone whose opinion is worth consulting  is the only fit subject for novelist or biographer  life  the same authorities have decided  has nothing whatever to do with sitting still in a chair and thinking  thought and life are as the poles asunder  therefore  since sitting in a chair and thinking is precisely what orlando is doing now  there is nothing for it but to recite the calendar  tell one own beads  blow one own nose  stir the fire  look out of the window  until she has done  orlando sat so still that you could have heard a pin drop  would  indeed  that a pin had dropped  that would have been life of a kind  or if a butterfly had fluttered through the window and settled on her chair  one could write about that  or suppose she had got up and killed a wasp  then  at once  we could out with our pens and write  for there would be blood she would  if only the blood of a wasp  where there is blood there is life  and if killing a wasp is the merest trifle compared with killing a man  still it is a fitter subject for novelist or biographer than this mere wool gathering  this thinking  this sitting in a chair day in  day out  with a cigarette and a sheet of paper and a pen and an ink pot  if only subjects  we might complain  for our patience is wearing thin   had more consideration for their biographers  what is more irritating than to see one own subject  on whom one has lavished so much time and trouble  slipping out of one own grasp altogether and indulging  witness her sighs and gasps  her flushing  her palings  her eyes now bright as lamps  now haggard as dawns  what is more humiliating than to see all this dumb show of emotion and excitement gone through before our eyes when we know that what causes it  thought and imagination  are of no importance whatsoever ,2204,399,-2.55,-0.8748591720151143,-0.8701754385964912,-0.8748591720151143,-0.3917453800144514,-2.55,-0.8948783983554018,-0.8413793103448275,-0.8948783983554018,-0.3389922319242839,-99.73508630678536,-1.4077441370573203,-1.4394053773099122,-1.4077441370573203,-0.5201961159155634,-1.629761904761902,-0.8854221359485843,-0.9097052704716798,-0.8854221359485843,-0.41944356715841413,6.857,0.3263997140503275,0.5030216608949549,0.3263997140503275,-0.23661488259714122,-37.45647273550977,-1.5595677439066187,-1.6837126818951103,-1.5595677439066187,-0.7275307394060254,-1.9612351367908356,-1.5410705785995307,-1.0942198922436237,-1.5410705785995307,-0.4312503612222288,"{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.9747}",-0.9747,-1.8202112355087545,-1.0184725668596637,-1.8202112355087545,-0.6065798975238134,0.11357526881720433,-0.003261999676909568,0.021140362847804905,-0.003261999676909568,-0.12223950497595795,0.5840223760440842,0.5675192168886083,0.5310264413913701,0.5675192168886083,-0.07532972717671704,67.49917595788459,1.3877110060877886,1.167119482496112,1.3877110060877886,-0.40729061548155404,-1.0,-0.8067597835723693,-0.06038938543615332,-0.8067597835723693,0.06299049248639015
359,359,5,"But Orlando was a woman--Lord Palmerston had just proved it. And when we are writing the life of a woman, we may, it is agreed, waive our demand for action, and substitute love instead. Love, the poet has said, is woman's whole existence. And if we look for a moment at Orlando writing at her table, we must admit that never was there a woman more fitted for that calling. Surely, since she is a woman, and a beautiful woman, and a woman in the prime of life, she will soon give over this pretence of writing and thinking and begin at least to think of a gamekeeper (and as long as she thinks of a man, nobody objects to a woman thinking). And then she will write him a little note (and as long as she writes little notes nobody objects to a woman writing either) and make an assignation for Sunday dusk and Sunday dusk will come; and the gamekeeper will whistle under the window--all of which is, of course, the very stuff of life and the only possible subject for fiction. Surely Orlando must have done one of these things? Alas,--a thousand times, alas, Orlando did none of them. Must it then be admitted that Orlando was one of those monsters of iniquity who do not love? She was kind to dogs, faithful to friends, generosity itself to a dozen starving poets, had a passion for poetry. But love--as the male novelists define it--and who, after all, speak with greater authority?--has nothing whatever to do with kindness, fidelity, generosity, or poetry. Love is slipping off one's petticoat and--But we all know what love is. Did Orlando do that? Truth compels us to say no, she did not. If then, the subject of one's biography will neither love nor kill, but will only think and imagine, we may conclude that he or she is no better than a corpse and so leave her.",but orlando was a woman  lord palmerston had just proved it  and when we are writing the life of a woman  we may  it is agreed  waive our demand for action  and substitute love instead  love  the poet has said  is woman own whole existence  and if we look for a moment at orlando writing at her table  we must admit that never was there a woman more fitted for that calling  surely  since she is a woman  and a beautiful woman  and a woman in the prime of life  she will soon give over this pretence of writing and thinking and begin at least to think of a gamekeeper  and as long as she thinks of a man  nobody objects to a woman thinking   and then she will write him a little note  and as long as she writes little notes nobody objects to a woman writing either  and make an assignation for sunday dusk and sunday dusk will come  and the gamekeeper will whistle under the window  all of which is  of course  the very stuff of life and the only possible subject for fiction  surely orlando must have done one of these things  alas   a thousand times  alas  orlando did none of them  must it then be admitted that orlando was one of those monsters of iniquity who do not love  she was kind to dogs  faithful to friends  generosity itself to a dozen starving poets  had a passion for poetry  but love  as the male novelists define it  and who  after all  speak with greater authority   has nothing whatever to do with kindness  fidelity  generosity  or poetry  love is slipping off one own petticoat and  but we all know what love is  did orlando do that  truth compels us to say no  she did not  if then  the subject of one own biography will neither love nor kill  but will only think and imagine  we may conclude that he or she is no better than a corpse and so leave her ,1769,325,10.200000000000001,2.399355936260413,2.7087719298245614,2.399355936260413,0.86365851938363,11.200000000000001,2.698407988095354,2.9517241379310346,2.698407988095354,0.9391015690819368,161.42925276563216,2.353654240651045,2.3297932862987203,2.353654240651045,1.0336914129677537,5.335416666666668,2.15293771920194,2.4610725073701105,2.15293771920194,0.8298263879607174,27.623000000000015,3.712723292108132,3.323147959530117,3.712723292108132,1.4215384768849395,88.52842065408383,2.2454845745240775,2.933970121981598,2.2454845745240775,0.827394153217841,4.2271640548801255,2.5202635841233043,2.3584357172978545,2.5202635841233043,1.1411387267368673,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.69, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.9978,1.175216856823394,0.5353499547047934,1.175216856823394,0.16944516997007383,0.18357843137254906,0.4650159338603737,0.4008096932529712,0.4650159338603737,0.09046622826429444,1.3292398967302537,2.4289038601180293,1.8311548790129621,2.4289038601180293,0.7581777138977764,59.18029676832176,1.0590409095395517,0.9268068990662741,1.0590409095395517,-0.2561331561069866,-0.9997,-0.8064141887222092,-0.06022309984064304,-0.8064141887222092,0.01652862411663485

She had bought another in Mayfair which was sanitary, convenient, and in the heart of the fashionable world, but was it in Mayfair that her poem would be relieved of its desire? Pray God, she thought, remembering the brightness of their ladyships' eyes and the symmetry of their lordship's legs, they haven't taken to reading there. For that would be a thousand pities. Then there was Lady R.'s. The same sort of talk would be going on there still, she had no doubt. The gout might have shifted from the General's left leg to his right, perhaps. Mr L. might have stayed ten days with R. instead of T. Then Mr Pope would come in. Oh! but Mr Pope was dead. Who were the wits now, she wondered--but that was not a question one could put to a porter, and so she moved on. Her ears were now distracted by the jingling of innumerable bells on the heads of innumerable horses. Fleets of the strangest little boxes on wheels were drawn up by the pavement. She walked out into the Strand. There the uproar was even worse. Vehicles of all sizes, drawn by blood horses and by dray horses, conveying one solitary dowager or crowded to the top by whiskered men in silk hats, were inextricably mixed. Carriages, carts, and omnibuses seemed to her eyes, so long used to the look of a plain sheet of foolscap, alarmingly at loggerheads; and to her ears, attuned to a pen scratching, the uproar of the street sounded violently and hideously cacophonous. Every inch of the pavement was crowded. Streams of people, threading in and out between their own bodies and the lurching and lumbering traffic with incredible agility, poured incessantly east and west. Along the edge of the pavement stood men, holding out trays of toys, and bawled. At corners, women sat beside great baskets of spring flowers and bawled. Boys running in and out of the horses' noses, holding printed sheets to their bodies, bawled too, Disaster! Disaster! At first Orlando supposed that she had arrived at some moment of national crisis; but whether it was happy or tragic, she could not tell. She looked anxiously at people's faces. But that confused her still more. Here would come by a man sunk in despair, muttering to himself as if he knew some terrible sorrow. Past him would nudge a fat, jolly-faced fellow, shouldering his way along as if it were a festival for all the world. Indeed, she came to the conclusion that there was neither rhyme nor reason in any of it. Each man and each woman was bent on his own affairs.

Sometimes she passed down avenues of sedate mansions, soberly numbered 'one', 'two', 'three', and so on right up to two or three hundred, each the copy of the other, with two pillars and six steps and a pair of curtains neatly drawn and family luncheons laid on tables, and a parrot looking out of one window and a man servant out of another, until her mind was dizzied with the monotony. Then she came to great open squares with black shiny, tightly buttoned statues of fat men in the middle, and war horses prancing, and columns rising and fountains falling and pigeons fluttering.

375,375,5,"A violent tumult of emotion besieged her at meeting the man who had caused her, years ago, so much pain. Could this be the plaguy, restless fellow who had burnt holes in her carpets, and toasted cheese in the Italian fireplace and told such merry stories of Marlowe and the rest that they had seen the sun rise nine nights out of ten? He was now sprucely dressed in a grey morning suit, had a pink flower in his button-hole, and grey suede gloves to match. But even as she marvelled, he made another bow, and asked her whether she would honour him by lunching with him? The bow was a thought overdone perhaps, but the imitation of fine breeding was creditable. She followed him, wondering, into a superb restaurant, all red plush, white table-cloths, and silver cruets, as unlike as could be the old tavern or coffee house with its sanded floor, its wooden benches, its bowls of punch and chocolate, and its broadsheets and spittoons. He laid his gloves neatly on the table beside him. Still she could hardly believe that he was the same man. His nails were clean; where they used to be an inch long. His chin was shaved; where a black beard used to sprout. He wore gold sleeve-links; where his ragged linen used to dip in the broth. It was not, indeed, until he had ordered the wine, which he did with a care that reminded her of his taste in Malmsey long ago, that she was convinced he was the same man. 'Ah!' he said, heaving a little sigh, which was yet comfortable enough, 'ah! my dear lady, the great days of literature are over. Marlowe, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson--those were the giants. Dryden, Pope, Addison--those were the heroes. All, all are dead now. And whom have they left us? Tennyson, Browning, Carlyle!'--he threw an immense amount of scorn into his voice. 'The truth of it is,' he said, pouring himself a glass of wine, 'that all our young writers are in the pay of the booksellers. They turn out any trash that serves to pay their tailor's bills. It is an age', he said, helping himself to hors-d'oeuvres, 'marked by precious conceits and wild experiments--none of which the Elizabethans would have tolerated for an instant.'",a violent tumult of emotion besieged her at meeting the man who had caused her  years ago  so much pain  could this be the plaguy  restless fellow who had burnt holes in her carpets  and toasted cheese in the italian fireplace and told such merry stories of marlowe and the rest that they had seen the sun rise nine nights out of ten  he was now sprucely dressed in a grey morning suit  had a pink flower in his button hole  and grey suede gloves to match  but even as she marvelled  he made another bow  and asked her whether she would honour him by lunching with him  the bow was a thought overdone perhaps  but the imitation of fine breeding was creditable  she followed him  wondering  into a superb restaurant  all red plush  white table cloths  and silver cruets  as unlike as could be the old tavern or coffee house with its sanded floor  its wooden benches  its bowls of punch and chocolate  and its broadsheets and spittoons  he laid his gloves neatly on the table beside him  still she could hardly believe that he was the same man  his nails were clean  where they used to be an inch long  his chin was shaved  where a black beard used to sprout  he wore gold sleeve links  where his ragged linen used to dip in the broth  it was not  indeed  until he had ordered the wine  which he did with a care that reminded her of his taste in malmsey long ago  that she was convinced he was the same man   ah   he said  heaving a little sigh  which was yet comfortable enough   ah  my dear lady  the great days of literature are over  marlowe  shakespeare  ben jonson  those were the giants  dryden  pope  addison  those were the heroes  all  all are dead now  and whom have they left us  tennyson  browning  carlyle    he threw an immense amount of scorn into his voice   the truth of it is   he said  pouring himself a glass of wine   that all our young writers are in the pay of the booksellers  they turn out any trash that serves to pay their tailor own bills  it is an age   he said  helping himself to hors d oeuvres   marked by precious conceits and wild experiments  none of which the elizabethans would have tolerated for an instant  ,2143,383,5.250000000000001,1.1281900706946202,1.3192982456140354,1.1281900706946202,0.2761937628435697,4.750000000000001,1.0128300104511812,1.1724137931034486,1.0128300104511812,0.24895935198597569,43.018094369741185,0.6482470603492534,0.6208494788580539,0.6482470603492534,0.2337461288050751,1.838690476190477,0.6275909714275724,0.7688421047779981,0.6275909714275724,0.12199726373703111,19.431,2.3768491347620104,2.210633530250561,2.3768491347620104,0.5837569948623889,62.602473943157236,1.462457490992248,1.9837149359803976,1.462457490992248,0.36490342296606176,2.1403370916657942,1.1507168928237967,1.1941451475521616,1.1507168928237967,0.49029346655739475,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9936}",0.9936,1.1688387589842077,0.5320414352672417,1.1688387589842077,0.10245659400418558,0.07440476190476192,-0.26528850480894006,-0.19130489802623377,-0.26528850480894006,-0.19084830714199177,0.43520212633455774,0.1957999272564779,0.27139025011778406,0.1957999272564779,-0.1792437984952513,65.03331932369144,1.290287624936732,1.0958867641662162,1.290287624936732,-0.3999338832695383,-0.9607,-0.761486858201374,-0.03860597242430547,-0.761486858201374,0.0628200995742634
376,376,5,"'No, my dear lady,' he continued, passing with approval the turbot au gratin, which the waiter exhibited for his sanction, 'the great days are over. We live in degenerate times. We must cherish the past; honour those writers--there are still a few left of 'em--who take antiquity for their model and write, not for pay but--' Here Orlando almost shouted 'Glawr!' Indeed she could have sworn that she had heard him say the very same things three hundred years ago. The names were different, of course, but the spirit was the same. Nick Greene had not changed, for all his knighthood. And yet, some change there was. For while he ran on about taking Addison as one's model (it had been Cicero once, she thought) and lying in bed of a morning (which she was proud to think her pension paid quarterly enabled him to do) rolling the best works of the best authors round and round on one's tongue for an hour, at least, before setting pen to paper, so that the vulgarity of the present time and the deplorable condition of our native tongue (he had lived long in America, she believed) might be purified--while he ran on in much the same way that Greene had run on three hundred years ago, she had time to ask herself, how was it then that he had changed? He had grown plump; but he was a man verging on seventy. He had grown sleek: literature had been a prosperous pursuit evidently; but somehow the old restless, uneasy vivacity had gone. His stories, brilliant as they were, were no longer quite so free and easy. He mentioned, it is true, 'my dear friend Pope' or 'my illustrious friend Addison' every other second, but he had an air of respectability about him which was depressing, and he preferred, it seemed, to enlighten her about the doings and sayings of her own blood relations rather than tell her, as he used to do, scandal about the poets.", no  my dear lady   he continued  passing with approval the turbot au gratin  which the waiter exhibited for his sanction   the great days are over  we live in degenerate times  we must cherish the past  honour those writers  there are still a few left of  them  who take antiquity for their model and write  not for pay but    here orlando almost shouted  glawr   indeed she could have sworn that she had heard him say the very same things three hundred years ago  the names were different  of course  but the spirit was the same  nick greene had not changed  for all his knighthood  and yet  some change there was  for while he ran on about taking addison as one own model  it had been cicero once  she thought  and lying in bed of a morning  which she was proud to think her pension paid quarterly enabled him to do  rolling the best works of the best authors round and round on one own tongue for an hour  at least  before setting pen to paper  so that the vulgarity of the present time and the deplorable condition of our native tongue  he had lived long in america  she believed  might be purified  while he ran on in much the same way that greene had run on three hundred years ago  she had time to ask herself  how was it then that he had changed  he had grown plump  but he was a man verging on seventy  he had grown sleek  literature had been a prosperous pursuit evidently  but somehow the old restless  uneasy vivacity had gone  his stories  brilliant as they were  were no longer quite so free and easy  he mentioned  it is true   my dear friend pope  or  my illustrious friend addison  every other second  but he had an air of respectability about him which was depressing  and he preferred  it seemed  to enlighten her about the doings and sayings of her own blood relations rather than tell her  as he used to do  scandal about the poets ,1848,334,8.85,2.052674336560651,2.3298245614035085,2.052674336560651,0.7012276100100232,9.35,2.214947637918343,2.4413793103448276,2.214947637918343,0.7367613869462388,102.5490754450973,1.5056372248546066,1.480017675823583,1.5056372248546066,0.6389653613530328,8.52202380952381,3.5430039059769967,4.003221704795743,3.5430039059769967,1.3842466232290467,26.957999999999995,3.6042813591692653,3.2328376451415766,3.6042813591692653,1.3168463409917788,75.82459192834078,1.8617978352230948,2.468340871744012,1.8617978352230948,0.634762623192445,4.218697189840432,2.5147069341445585,2.353711851210826,2.5147069341445585,1.1081654074551095,"{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.9951}",0.9951,1.1711166510696314,0.5332230493520816,1.1711166510696314,0.15666217372302874,0.1820869990224829,0.4550391723341002,0.39272075696746356,0.4550391723341002,0.07552249639979047,1.0014902094168097,1.6102593464641362,1.2593531203728265,1.6102593464641362,0.4117643406852803,57.37428178182987,0.9876871722809816,0.8746354325469151,0.9876871722809816,-0.3767789839702672,-0.9993,-0.8059533955886619,-0.060001385713295954,-0.8059533955886619,0.023385665555486324

383,383,5,"Orlando walked up the street. Now that the poem was gone,--and she felt a bare place in her breast where she had been used to carry it--she had nothing to do but reflect upon whatever she liked--the extraordinary chances it might be of the human lot. Here she was in St James's Street; a married woman; with a ring on her finger; where there had been a coffee house once there was now a restaurant; it was about half past three in the afternoon; the sun was shining; there were three pigeons; a mongrel terrier dog; two hansom cabs and a barouche landau. What then, was Life? The thought popped into her head violently, irrelevantly (unless old Greene were somehow the cause of it). And it may be taken as a comment, adverse or favourable, as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband (who was at the Horn), that whenever anything popped violently into her head, she went straight to the nearest telegraph office and wired to him. There was one, as it happened, close at hand. 'My God Shel', she wired; 'life literature Greene toady--' here she dropped into a cypher language which they had invented between them so that a whole spiritual state of the utmost complexity might be conveyed in a word or two without the telegraph clerk being any wiser, and added the words 'Rattigan Glumphoboo', which summed it up precisely.

384,384,5,"There could be no answer to her telegram for some hours; indeed, it was probable, she thought, glancing at the sky, where the upper clouds raced swiftly past, that there was a gale at Cape Horn, so that her husband would be at the mast-head, as likely as not, or cutting away some tattered spar, or even alone in a boat with a biscuit. And so, leaving the post office, she turned to beguile herself into the next shop, which was a shop so common in our day that it needs no description, yet, to her eyes, strange in the extreme; a shop where they sold books. All her life long Orlando had known manuscripts; she had held in her hands the rough brown sheets on which Spenser had written in his little crabbed hand; she had seen Shakespeare's script and Milton's. She owned, indeed, a fair number of quartos and folios, often with a sonnet in her praise in them and sometimes a lock of hair. But these innumerable little volumes, bright, identical, ephemeral, for they seemed bound in cardboard and printed on tissue paper, surprised her infinitely. The whole works of Shakespeare cost half a crown, and could be put in your pocket. One could hardly read them, indeed, the print was so small, but it was a marvel, none the less. 'Works'--the works of every writer she had known or heard of and many more stretched from end to end of the long shelves. On tables and chairs, more 'works' were piled and tumbled, and these she saw, turning a page or two, were often works about other works by Sir Nicholas and a score of others whom, in her ignorance, she supposed, since they were bound and printed, to be very great writers too. So she gave an astounding order to the bookseller to send her everything of any importance in the shop and left.",there could be no answer to her telegram for some hours  indeed  it was probable  she thought  glancing at the sky  where the upper clouds raced swiftly past  that there was a gale at cape horn  so that her husband would be at the mast head  as likely as not  or cutting away some tattered spar  or even alone in a boat with a biscuit  and so  leaving the post office  she turned to beguile herself into the next shop  which was a shop so common in our day that it needs no description  yet  to her eyes  strange in the extreme  a shop where they sold books  all her life long orlando had known manuscripts  she had held in her hands the rough brown sheets on which spenser had written in his little crabbed hand  she had seen shakespeare own script and milton own  she owned  indeed  a fair number of quartos and folios  often with a sonnet in her praise in them and sometimes a lock of hair  but these innumerable little volumes  bright  identical  ephemeral  for they seemed bound in cardboard and printed on tissue paper  surprised her infinitely  the whole works of shakespeare cost half a crown  and could be put in your pocket  one could hardly read them  indeed  the print was so small  but it was a marvel  none the less   works   the works of every writer she had known or heard of and many more stretched from end to end of the long shelves  on tables and chairs  more  works  were piled and tumbled  and these she saw  turning a page or two  were often works about other works by sir nicholas and a score of others whom  in her ignorance  she supposed  since they were bound and printed  to be very great writers too  so she gave an astounding order to the bookseller to send her everything of any importance in the shop and left ,1738,319,2.1,0.3192663380618427,0.43508771929824563,0.3192663380618427,0.03942382658115534,3.1,0.5816356440770903,0.7172413793103448,0.5816356440770903,0.1649820149337576,88.5262287568493,1.3036743038395613,1.2776359295826574,1.3036743038395613,0.5775283574072483,-0.7518333333333334,-0.5024509170827468,-0.4848343086211137,-0.5024509170827468,-0.31415973448054235,11.977,1.1613210623916521,1.1983431791946768,1.1613210623916521,0.2612584782634209,31.690392826318327,0.528836937316713,0.8507046077987851,0.528836937316713,0.09273814723645987,1.871495521526325,0.9742810457897181,1.0441520190433744,0.9742810457897181,0.5147197248050115,"{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.972}",0.972,1.1360371129541065,0.5150261924455473,1.1360371129541065,0.1661890661283027,0.09838709677419356,-0.10486149259820181,-0.061234245657765994,-0.10486149259820181,-0.10419282970583402,0.5269839702986361,0.4250501933059259,0.43151555861183666,0.4250501933059259,-0.015576844144659081,55.63445777628257,0.9189485704994327,0.824376065634737,0.9189485704994327,-0.34609209704533644,-0.9997,-0.8064141887222092,-0.06022309984064304,-0.8064141887222092,0.011810480298014826
385,385,5,"She turned into Hyde Park, which she had known of old (beneath that cleft tree, she remembered, the Duke of Hamilton fell run through the body by Lord Mohun), and her lips, which are often to blame in the matter, began framing the words of her telegram into a senseless singsong; life literature Greene toady Rattigan Glumphoboo; so that several park keepers looked at her with suspicion and were only brought to a favourable opinion of her sanity by noticing the pearl necklace which she wore. She had carried off a sheaf of papers and critical journals from the book shop, and at length, flinging herself on her elbow beneath a tree, she spread these pages round her and did her best to fathom the noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it. For still the old credulity was alive in her; even the blurred type of a weekly newspaper had some sanctity in her eyes. So she read, lying on her elbow, an article by Sir Nicholas on the collected works of a man she had once known--John Donne. But she had pitched herself, without knowing it, not far from the Serpentine. The barking of a thousand dogs sounded in her ears. Carriage wheels rushed ceaselessly in a circle. Leaves sighed overhead. Now and again a braided skirt and a pair of tight scarlet trousers crossed the grass within a few steps of her. Once a gigantic rubber ball bounced on the newspaper. Violets, oranges, reds, and blues broke through the interstices of the leaves and sparkled in the emerald on her finger. She read a sentence and looked up at the sky; she looked up at the sky and looked down at the newspaper. Life? Literature? One to be made into the other? But how monstrously difficult! For--here came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers--how would Addison have put that? Here came two dogs dancing on their hind legs. How would Lamb have described that? For reading Sir Nicholas and his friends (as she did in the intervals of looking about her), she somehow got the impression--here she rose and walked--they made one feel--it was an extremely uncomfortable feeling--one must never, never say what one thought. (She stood on the banks of the Serpentine. It was a bronze colour; spider-thin boats were skimming from side to side.) They made one feel, she continued, that one must always, always write like somebody else. (The tears formed themselves in her eyes.) For really, she thought, pushing a little boat off with her toe, I don't think I could (here the whole of Sir Nicholas' article came before her as articles do, ten minutes after they are read, with the look of his room, his head, his cat, his writing-table, and the time of the day thrown in), I don't think I could, she continued, considering the article from this point of view, sit in a study, no, it's not a study, it's a mouldy kind of drawing-room, all day long, and talk to pretty young men, and tell them little anecdotes, which they mustn't repeat, about what Tupper said about Smiles; and then, she continued, weeping bitterly, they're all so manly; and then, I do detest Duchesses; and I don't like cake; and though I'm spiteful enough, I could never learn to be as spiteful as all that, so how can I be a critic and write the best English prose of my time?

If one looks at the Serpentine in this state of mind, the waves soon become just as big as the waves on the Atlantic; the toy boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners. So Orlando mistook the toy boat for her husband's brig; and the wave she had made with her toe for a mountain of water off Cape Horn; and as she watched the toy boat climb the ripple, she thought she saw Bonthrop's ship climb up and up a glassy wall; up and up it went, and a white crest with a thousand deaths in it arched over it; and through the thousand deaths it went and disappeared--'It's sunk!' she cried out in an agony--and then, behold, there it was again sailing along safe and sound among the ducks on the other side of the Atlantic.",now  the truth is that when one has been in a state of mind  as nurses call it   and the tears still stood in orlando own eyes  the thing one is looking at becomes  not itself  but another thing  which is bigger and much more important and yet remains the same thing  if one looks at the serpentine in this state of mind  the waves soon become just as big as the waves on the atlantic  the toy boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners  so orlando mistook the toy boat for her husband own brig  and the wave she had made with her toe for a mountain of water off cape horn  and as she watched the toy boat climb the ripple  she thought she saw bonthrop own ship climb up and up a glassy wall  up and up it went  and a white crest with a thousand deaths in it arched over it  and through the thousand deaths it went and disappeared   it is sunk   she cried out in an agony  and then  behold  there it was again sailing along safe and sound among the ducks on the other side of the atlantic ,988,186,-0.6000000000000001,-0.37409686133768083,-0.3228070175438597,-0.37409686133768083,-0.2865566137207632,-0.6000000000000001,-0.38528505627693116,-0.303448275862069,-0.38528505627693116,-0.2399680877715067,-15.954413367730716,-0.20109973684733187,-0.23025867068181752,-0.20109973684733187,-0.17850892266449764,1.0491071428571432,0.28315783483336027,0.38672556225719834,0.28315783483336027,0.17315943995570895,0.9799999999999996,-0.6319660602078688,-0.29510423032525296,-0.6319660602078688,-0.5280187861544834,13.099414332800551,-0.03265614265042969,0.16929559607476705,-0.03265614265042969,-0.03001837181053506,-0.9314702162086343,-0.8652545360334728,-0.5196894653211882,-0.8652545360334728,-0.43936831123057407,"{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.4138}",-0.4138,-0.9684314550326573,-0.5766276734018669,-0.9684314550326573,-0.5758759476829266,0.28958333333333336,1.1741232744862065,0.9757381490251946,1.1741232744862065,0.8435283661933458,0.6963051846494127,0.8479762510229986,0.7269183366723545,0.8479762510229986,0.6482413226829001,35.20957417268638,0.11198307514725839,0.23434988143529106,0.11198307514725839,-0.1718470480086705,0.5258,0.950935624342759,0.7853391533291761,0.950935624342759,0.49790897324495575

Orlando then came to the conclusion (opening half-a-dozen books) that it was very odd that there was not a single dedication to a nobleman among them; next (turning over a vast pile of memoirs) that several of these writers had family trees half as high as her own; next, that it would be impolitic in the extreme to wrap a ten-pound note round the sugar tongs when Miss Christina Rossetti came to tea; next (here were half-a-dozen invitations to celebrate centenaries by dining) that literature since it ate all these dinners must be growing very corpulent; next (she was invited to a score of lectures on the Influence of this upon that; the Classical revival; the Romantic survival, and other titles of the same engaging kind) that literature since it listened to all these lectures must be growing very dry; next (here she attended a reception given by a peeress) that literature since it wore all those fur tippets must be growing very respectable; next (here she visited Carlyle's sound-proof room at Chelsea) that genius since it needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate; and so at last she reached her final conclusion, which was of the highest importance but which, as we have already much overpassed our limit of six lines, we must omit.",and now it was clear that there are only two ways of coming to a conclusion upon victorian literature  one is to write it out in sixty volumes octavo  the other is to squeeze it into six lines of the length of this one  of the two courses  economy  since time runs short  leads us to choose the second  and so we proceed  orlando then came to the conclusion  opening half a dozen books  that it was very odd that there was not a single dedication to a nobleman among them  next  turning over a vast pile of memoirs  that several of these writers had family trees half as high as her own  next  that it would be impolitic in the extreme to wrap a ten pound note round the sugar tongs when miss christina rossetti came to tea  next  here were half a dozen invitations to celebrate centenaries by dining  that literature since it ate all these dinners must be growing very corpulent  next  she was invited to a score of lectures on the influence of this upon that  the classical revival  the romantic survival  and other titles of the same engaging kind  that literature since it listened to all these lectures must be growing very dry  next  here she attended a reception given by a peeress  that literature since it wore all those fur tippets must be growing very respectable  next  here she visited carlyle own sound proof room at chelsea  that genius since it needed all this coddling must be growing very delicate  and so at last she reached her final conclusion  which was of the highest importance but which  as we have already much overpassed our limit of six lines  we must omit ,1583,279,8.5,1.962793921823676,2.231578947368421,1.962793921823676,0.8331283213185643,9.5,2.2541471257705332,2.4827586206896552,2.2541471257705332,0.9262319649498343,75.08091226923818,1.1100292150655817,1.0835892648776166,1.1100292150655817,0.5600378383474923,2.7744047619047616,1.0357695547114778,1.2216782938791637,1.0357695547114778,0.43541306163648197,3.440999999999996,-0.23064937304615069,0.039111835404358836,-0.23064937304615069,-0.35526652866793984,63.85907185319354,1.5004098252942093,2.0297726053123726,1.5004098252942093,0.6426835861394693,1.9098939085011488,0.9994812108056073,1.0655753956032457,0.9994812108056073,0.6005895100781588,"{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.8884}",0.8884,1.0090825940598265,0.44917090078380406,1.0090825940598265,0.18550272587147612,0.03493107769423559,-0.5293430788661411,-0.4053944720649322,-0.5293430788661411,-0.2432774676917331,0.41983341770112276,0.1574123726936129,0.24457754833716672,0.1574123726936129,-0.0622970225637351,51.56713552953102,0.7582529809770088,0.7068808244507041,0.7582529809770088,-0.2241382729976019,-0.9964,-0.8026126453704461,-0.05839395829002982,-0.8026126453704461,-0.02386525356423626
394,394,5,"Orlando, having come to this conclusion, stood looking out of the window for a considerable space of time. For, when anybody comes to a conclusion it is as if they had tossed the ball over the net and must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them. What would be sent her next from the colourless sky above Chesterfield House, she wondered? And with her hands clasped, she stood for a considerable space of time wondering. Suddenly she started--and here we could only wish that, as on a former occasion, Purity, Chastity, and Modesty would push the door ajar and provide, at least, a breathing space in which we could think how to wrap up what now has to be told delicately, as a biographer should. But no! Having thrown their white garment at the naked Orlando and seen it fall short by several inches, these ladies had given up all intercourse with her these many years; and were now otherwise engaged. Is nothing then, going to happen this pale March morning to mitigate, to veil, to cover, to conceal, to shroud this undeniable event whatever it may be? For after giving that sudden, violent start, Orlando--but Heaven be praised, at this very moment there struck up outside one of these frail, reedy, fluty, jerky, old-fashioned barrel-organs which are still sometimes played by Italian organ-grinders in back streets. Let us accept the intervention, humble though it is, as if it were the music of the spheres, and allow it, with all its gasps and groans, to fill this page with sound until the moment comes when it is impossible to deny its coming; which the footman has seen coming and the maid-servant; and the reader will have to see too; for Orlando herself is clearly unable to ignore it any longer--let the barrel-organ sound and transport us on thought, which is no more than a little boat, when music sounds, tossing on the waves; on thought, which is, of all carriers, the most clumsy, the most erratic, over the roof tops and the back gardens where washing is hanging to--what is this place? Do you recognize the Green and in the middle the steeple, and the gate with a lion couchant on either side? Oh yes, it is Kew! Well, Kew will do. So here we are at Kew, and I will show you to-day (the second of March) under the plum tree, a grape hyacinth, and a crocus, and a bud, too, on the almond tree; so that to walk there is to be thinking of bulbs, hairy and red, thrust into the earth in October; flowering now; and to be dreaming of more than can rightly be said, and to be taking from its case a cigarette or cigar even, and to be flinging a cloak under (as the rhyme requires) an oak, and there to sit, waiting the kingfisher, which, it is said, was seen once to cross in the evening from bank to bank.",orlando  having come to this conclusion  stood looking out of the window for a considerable space of time  for  when anybody comes to a conclusion it is as if they had tossed the ball over the net and must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them  what would be sent her next from the colourless sky above chesterfield house  she wondered  and with her hands clasped  she stood for a considerable space of time wondering  suddenly she started  and here we could only wish that  as on a former occasion  purity  chastity  and modesty would push the door ajar and provide  at least  a breathing space in which we could think how to wrap up what now has to be told delicately  as a biographer should  but no  having thrown their white garment at the naked orlando and seen it fall short by several inches  these ladies had given up all intercourse with her these many years  and were now otherwise engaged  is nothing then  going to happen this pale march morning to mitigate  to veil  to cover  to conceal  to shroud this undeniable event whatever it may be  for after giving that sudden  violent start  orlando  but heaven be praised  at this very moment there struck up outside one of these frail  reedy  fluty  jerky  old fashioned barrel organs which are still sometimes played by italian organ grinders in back streets  let us accept the intervention  humble though it is  as if it were the music of the spheres  and allow it  with all its gasps and groans  to fill this page with sound until the moment comes when it is impossible to deny its coming  which the footman has seen coming and the maid servant  and the reader will have to see too  for orlando herself is clearly unable to ignore it any longer  let the barrel organ sound and transport us on thought  which is no more than a little boat  when music sounds  tossing on the waves  on thought  which is  of all carriers  the most clumsy  the most erratic  over the roof tops and the back gardens where washing is hanging to  what is this place  do you recognize the green and in the middle the steeple  and the gate with a lion couchant on either side  oh yes  it is kew  well  kew will do  so here we are at kew  and i will show you to day  the second of march  under the plum tree  a grape hyacinth  and a crocus  and a bud  too  on the almond tree  so that to walk there is to be thinking of bulbs  hairy and red  thrust into the earth in october  flowering now  and to be dreaming of more than can rightly be said  and to be taking from its case a cigarette or cigar even  and to be flinging a cloak under  as the rhyme requires  an oak  and there to sit  waiting the kingfisher  which  it is said  was seen once to cross in the evening from bank to bank ,2733,500,1.8499999999999996,0.25506604182114595,0.3649122807017543,0.25506604182114595,-0.05638989031900871,0.8499999999999998,-0.006356673705760601,0.09655172413793096,-0.006356673705760601,-0.08586147888160872,-96.7597813477048,-1.3648925468056738,-1.3964649225930645,-1.3648925468056738,-0.4027327123246461,0.6574849206349211,0.11232384598692799,0.19720113435657433,0.11232384598692799,-0.09041339135025295,10.995000000000001,1.0011857569089997,1.0649826848645347,1.0011857569089997,-0.11912707679436177,43.118288173593385,0.8739873638163722,1.2695674921481677,0.8739873638163722,0.037097963076969914,0.0,-0.25394752537091686,0.0,-0.25394752537091686,0.0,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.962}",0.962,1.1208511657179487,0.5071487652132813,1.1208511657179487,0.008109718690757696,-0.008011033681765391,-0.8165992890549806,-0.6382954164961289,-0.8165992890549806,-0.35048022911407767,0.08352231170501984,-0.6826166264531676,-0.34216071352079525,-0.6826166264531676,-0.48686064817629027,80.51261941846407,1.901858359493272,1.5430468335332086,1.901858359493272,-0.5025729835490441,-0.8622,-0.648016549065419,0.01599113143490608,-0.648016549065419,0.12675168307273246

401,401,5,"Once more Orlando stood at the window, but let the reader take courage; nothing of the same sort is going to happen to-day, which is not, by any means, the same day. No--for if we look out of the window, as Orlando was doing at the moment, we shall see that Park Lane itself has considerably changed. Indeed one might stand there ten minutes or more, as Orlando stood now, without seeing a single barouche landau. 'Look at that!' she exclaimed, some days later when an absurd truncated carriage without any horses began to glide about of its own accord. A carriage without any horses indeed! She was called away just as she said that, but came back again after a time and had another look out of the window. It was odd sort of weather nowadays. The sky itself, she could not help thinking, had changed. It was no longer so thick, so watery, so prismatic now that King Edward--see, there he was, stepping out of his neat brougham to go and visit a certain lady opposite--had succeeded Queen Victoria. The clouds had shrunk to a thin gauze; the sky seemed made of metal, which in hot weather tarnished verdigris, copper colour or orange as metal does in a fog. It was a little alarming--this shrinkage. Everything seemed to have shrunk. Driving past Buckingham Palace last night, there was not a trace of that vast erection which she had thought everlasting; top hats, widows' weeds, trumpets, telescopes, wreaths, all had vanished and left not a stain, not a puddle even, on the pavement. But it was now--after another interval she had come back again to her favourite station in the window--now, in the evening, that the change was most remarkable. Look at the lights in the houses! At a touch, a whole room was lit; hundreds of rooms were lit; and one was precisely the same as the other. One could see everything in the little square-shaped boxes; there was no privacy; none of those lingering shadows and odd corners that there used to be; none of those women in aprons carrying wobbly lamps which they put down carefully on this table and on that. At a touch, the whole room was bright. And the sky was bright all night long; and the pavements were bright; everything was bright. She came back again at mid-day. How narrow women have grown lately! They looked like stalks of corn, straight, shining, identical. And men's faces were as bare as the palm of one's hand. The dryness of the atmosphere brought out the colour in everything and seemed to stiffen the muscles of the cheeks. It was harder to cry now. Water was hot in two seconds. Ivy had perished or been scraped off houses. Vegetables were less fertile; families were much smaller. Curtains and covers had been frizzled up and the walls were bare so that new brilliantly coloured pictures of real things like streets, umbrellas, apples, were hung in frames, or painted upon the wood. There was something definite and distinct about the age, which reminded her of the eighteenth century, except that there was a distraction, a desperation--as she was thinking this, the immensely long tunnel in which she seemed to have been travelling for hundreds of years widened; the light poured in; her thoughts became mysteriously tightened and strung up as if a piano tuner had put his key in her back and stretched the nerves very taut; at the same time her hearing quickened; she could hear every whisper and crackle in the room so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a hammer. And so for some seconds the light went on becoming brighter and brighter, and she saw everything more and more clearly and the clock ticked louder and louder until there was a terrific explosion right in her ear. Orlando leapt as if she had been violently struck on the head. Ten times she was struck. In fact it was ten o'clock in the morning. It was the eleventh of October. It was     .

402,402,5,"No one need wonder that Orlando started, pressed her hand to her heart, and turned pale. For what more terrifying revelation can there be than that it is the present moment? That we survive the shock at all is only possible because the past shelters us on one side and the future on another. But we have no time now for reflections; Orlando was terribly late already. She ran downstairs, she jumped into her motorcar, she pressed the self-starter and was off. Vast blue blocks of building rose into the air; the red cowls of chimneys were spotted irregularly across the sky; the road shone like silver-headed nails; omnibuses bore down upon her with sculptured white-faced drivers; she noticed sponges, bird-cages, boxes of green American cloth. But she did not allow these sights to sink into her mind even the fraction of an inch as she crossed the narrow plank of the present, lest she should fall into the raging torrent beneath. 'Why don't you look where you're going to?...Put your hand out, can't you?'--that was all she said sharply, as if the words were jerked out of her. For the streets were immensely crowded; people crossed without looking where they were going. People buzzed and hummed round the plate-glass windows within which one could see a glow of red, a blaze of yellow, as if they were bees, Orlando thought--but her thought that they were bees was violently snipped off and she saw, regaining perspective with one flick of her eye, that they were bodies.

403,403,5,"At last, however, she drew up at Marshall & Snelgrove's and went into the shop. Shade and scent enveloped her. The present fell from her like drops of scalding water. Light swayed up and down like thin stuffs puffed out by a summer breeze. She took a list from her bag and began reading in a curious stiff voice at first, as if she were holding the words--boy's boots, bath salts, sardines--under a tap of many-coloured water. She watched them change as the light fell on them. Bath and boots became blunt, obtuse; sardines serrated itself like a saw. So she stood in the ground-floor department of Messrs Marshall & Snelgrove; looked this way and that; snuffed this smell and that and thus wasted some seconds. Then she got into the lift, for the good reason that the door stood open; and was shot smoothly upwards. The very fabric of life now, she thought as she rose, is magic. In the eighteenth century we knew how everything was done; but here I rise through the air; I listen to voices in America; I see men flying--but how its done I can't even begin to wonder. So my belief in magic returns. Now the lift gave a little jerk as it stopped at the first floor; and she had a vision of innumerable coloured stuffs flaunting in a breeze from which came distinct, strange smells; and each time the lift stopped and flung its doors open, there was another slice of the world displayed with all the smells of that world clinging to it. She was reminded of the river off Wapping in the time of Elizabeth, where the treasure ships and the merchant ships used to anchor. How richly and curiously they had smelt! How well she remembered the feel of rough rubies running through her fingers when she dabbled them in a treasure sack! And then lying with Sukey--or whatever her name was--and having Cumberland's lantern flashed on them! The Cumberlands had a house in Portland Place now and she had lunched with them the other day and ventured a little joke with the old man about almshouses in the Sheen Road. He had winked.

And indeed, it cannot be denied that the most successful practitioners of the art of life, often unknown people by the way, somehow contrive to synchronize the sixty or seventy different times which beat simultaneously in every normal human system so that when eleven strikes, all the rest chime in unison, and the present is neither a violent disruption nor completely forgotten in the past. Of them we can justly say that they live precisely the sixty-eight or seventy-two years allotted them on the tombstone. Of the rest some we know to be dead though they walk among us; some are not yet born though they go through the forms of life; others are hundreds of years old though they call themselves thirty-six. The true length of a person's life, whatever the ""Dictionary of National Biography"" may say, is always a matter of dispute. For it is a difficult business--this time-keeping; nothing more quickly disorders it than contact with any of the arts; and it may have been her love of poetry that was to blame for making Orlando lose her shopping list and start home without the sardines, the bath salts, or the boots.

415,415,5,"The Old Kent Road was very crowded on Thursday, the eleventh of October     . People spilt off the pavement. There were women with shopping bags. Children ran out. There were sales at drapers' shops. Streets widened and narrowed. Long vistas steadily shrunk together. Here was a market. Here a funeral. Here a procession with banners upon which was written 'Ra--Un', but what else? Meat was very red. Butchers stood at the door. Women almost had their heels sliced off. Amor Vin-- that was over a porch. A woman looked out of a bedroom window, profoundly contemplative, and very still. Applejohn and Applebed, Undert--. Nothing could be seen whole or read from start to finish. What was seen begun--like two friends starting to meet each other across the street--was never seen ended. After twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of torn paper tumbling from a sack and, indeed, the process of motoring fast out of London so much resembles the chopping up small of identity which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself that it is an open question in what sense Orlando can be said to have existed at the present moment. Indeed we should have given her over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here, at last, one green screen was held out on the right, against which the little bits of paper fell more slowly; and then another was held out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now turning over by themselves in the air; and then green screens were held continuously on either side, so that her mind regained the illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage, a farmyard and four cows, all precisely life-size.",the old kent road was very crowded on thursday  the eleventh of october       people spilt off the pavement  there were women with shopping bags  children ran out  there were sales at drapers  shops  streets widened and narrowed  long vistas steadily shrunk together  here was a market  here a funeral  here a procession with banners upon which was written  ra  un   but what else  meat was very red  butchers stood at the door  women almost had their heels sliced off  amor vin   that was over a porch  a woman looked out of a bedroom window  profoundly contemplative  and very still  applejohn and applebed  undert    nothing could be seen whole or read from start to finish  what was seen begun  like two friends starting to meet each other across the street  was never seen ended  after twenty minutes the body and mind were like scraps of torn paper tumbling from a sack and  indeed  the process of motoring fast out of london so much resembles the chopping up small of identity which precedes unconsciousness and perhaps death itself that it is an open question in what sense orlando can be said to have existed at the present moment  indeed we should have given her over for a person entirely disassembled were it not that here  at last  one green screen was held out on the right  against which the little bits of paper fell more slowly  and then another was held out on the left so that one could see the separate scraps now turning over by themselves in the air  and then green screens were held continuously on either side  so that her mind regained the illusion of holding things within itself and she saw a cottage  a farmyard and four cows  all precisely life size ,1679,292,0.8500000000000001,-0.001735143141640403,0.08421052631578949,-0.001735143141640403,-0.08261225228353215,-0.1499999999999999,-0.26768659272036094,-0.17931034482758618,-0.26768659272036094,-0.15511827821908955,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,0.028682417836622575,0.0,-0.6467261904761898,-0.4566009334718864,-0.4339680145552839,-0.4566009334718864,-0.30550505450692,-0.8700000000000001,-0.9336466255265115,-0.5463434508046445,-0.9336466255265115,-0.7297179696286132,6.374715184312791,-0.23575852577961084,-0.07718258701334293,-0.23575852577961084,-0.23632115595080772,-0.17280184179538063,-0.3673542403755945,-0.09641027185462193,-0.3673542403755945,-0.05192042249849859,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.8201}",0.8201,0.905362574436868,0.39536807278742764,0.905362574436868,0.132622804321879,0.048928571428571425,-0.43570848863696854,-0.3294776294613684,-0.43570848863696854,-0.21111991353321546,0.24981928070488782,-0.2672444489083647,-0.052034122981259014,-0.2672444489083647,-0.2683476415985539,50.803741487841904,0.7280920917912269,0.6848281908984073,0.7280920917912269,-0.3509730895120845,-0.9937,-0.7995022917190038,-0.05689738793043726,-0.7995022917190038,-0.010144947730174231

Some say two thousand and fifty-two. So that it is the most usual thing in the world for a person to call, directly they are alone, Orlando? (if that is one's name) meaning by that, Come, come! I'm sick to death of this particular self. I want another. Hence, the astonishing changes we see in our friends. But it is not altogether plain sailing, either, for though one may say, as Orlando said (being out in the country and needing another self presumably) Orlando? still the Orlando she needs may not come; these selves of which we are built up, one on top of another, as plates are piled on a waiter's hand, have attachments elsewhere, sympathies, little constitutions and rights of their own, call them what you will (and for many of these things there is no name) so that one will only come if it is raining, another in a room with green curtains, another when Mrs Jones is not there, another if you can promise it a glass of wine--and so on; for everybody can multiply from his own experience the different terms which his different selves have made with him--and some are too wildly ridiculous to be mentioned in print at all.",when this happened  orlando heaved a sigh of relief  lit a cigarette  and puffed for a minute or two in silence  then she called hesitatingly  as if the person she wanted might not be there   orlando  for if there are  at a venture  seventy six different times all ticking in the mind at once  how many different people are there not  heaven help us  all having lodgment at one time or another in the human spirit  some say two thousand and fifty two  so that it is the most usual thing in the world for a person to call  directly they are alone  orlando   if that is one own name  meaning by that  come  come  I am sick to death of this particular self  i want another  hence  the astonishing changes we see in our friends  but it is not altogether plain sailing  either  for though one may say  as orlando said  being out in the country and needing another self presumably  orlando  still the orlando she needs may not come  these selves of which we are built up  one on top of another  as plates are piled on a waiter own hand  have attachments elsewhere  sympathies  little constitutions and rights of their own  call them what you will  and for many of these things there is no name  so that one will only come if it is raining  another in a room with green curtains  another when mrs jones is not there  another if you can promise it a glass of wine  and so on  for everybody can multiply from his own experience the different terms which his different selves have made with him  and some are too wildly ridiculous to be mentioned in print at all ,1548,279,-0.4500000000000002,-0.33557668359326287,-0.28070175438596495,-0.33557668359326287,-0.23295467534122097,-0.45000000000000007,-0.3460855684247411,-0.2620689655172414,-0.3460855684247411,-0.1895075085672179,15.008343558111525,0.2448388782173676,0.2166047197834587,0.2448388782173676,0.11194909637379365,6.430654761904761,2.63070399989048,2.991109777055953,2.63070399989048,1.2339719270097123,6.606999999999999,0.2856320700883487,0.46907041488422624,0.2856320700883487,-0.0777760937605838,12.768978141370123,-0.042636124872644385,0.15718422718049585,-0.042636124872644385,-0.13470715500821712,-0.520565776971844,-0.5955854043244306,-0.2904360714829465,-0.5955854043244306,-0.163698278508221,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.3335}",0.3335,0.1664143819254238,0.012052463665366919,0.1664143819254238,-0.09445819517771742,0.1361359126984127,0.14765477765597673,0.1435003283581604,0.14765477765597673,0.032080345903242234,0.5935634342161347,0.5913506200274675,0.5476720525185252,0.5913506200274675,0.13532869699341096,49.45374881232519,0.674755312533971,0.6458301215585123,0.674755312533971,-0.31274419067896714,-0.9933,-0.7990414985854565,-0.056675673803090174,-0.7990414985854565,-0.022959141804050006

418,418,5,"'All right then,' Orlando said, with the good humour people practise on these occasions; and tried another. For she had a great variety of selves to call upon, far more than we have been able to find room for, since a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well have as many thousand. Choosing then, only those selves we have found room for, Orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the nigger's head down; the boy who strung it up again; the boy who sat on the hill; the boy who saw the poet; the boy who handed the Queen the bowl of rose water; or she may have called upon the young man who fell in love with Sasha; or upon the Courtier; or upon the Ambassador; or upon the Soldier; or upon the Traveller; or she may have wanted the woman to come to her; the Gipsy; the Fine Lady; the Hermit; the girl in love with life; the Patroness of Letters; the woman who called Mar (meaning hot baths and evening fires) or Shelmerdine (meaning crocuses in autumn woods) or Bonthrop (meaning the death we die daily) or all three together--which meant more things than we have space to write out--all were different and she may have called upon any one of them.", right then   orlando said  with the good humour people practise on these occasions  and tried another  for she had a great variety of selves to call upon  far more than we have been able to find room for  since a biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves  whereas a person may well have as many thousand  choosing then  only those selves we have found room for  orlando may now have called on the boy who cut the nigger own head down  the boy who strung it up again  the boy who sat on the hill  the boy who saw the poet  the boy who handed the queen the bowl of rose water  or she may have called upon the young man who fell in love with sasha  or upon the courtier  or upon the ambassador  or upon the soldier  or upon the traveller  or she may have wanted the woman to come to her  the gipsy  the fine lady  the hermit  the girl in love with life  the patroness of letters  the woman who called mar  meaning hot baths and evening fires  or shelmerdine  meaning crocuses in autumn woods  or bonthrop  meaning the death we die daily  or all three together  which meant more things than we have space to write out  all were different and she may have called upon any one of them ,1219,229,3.8499999999999996,0.7686684117467188,0.9263157894736842,0.7686684117467188,0.3793713980250786,3.8499999999999996,0.7776330833380405,0.9241379310344826,0.7776330833380405,0.38693299448264884,93.13273788814975,1.3700191809193059,1.3441183908684,1.3700191809193059,0.8463673883943184,1.44935,0.45775232899924084,0.5804219211892191,0.45775232899924084,0.21512486880059106,20.025,2.4737130568156713,2.2913016907720514,2.4737130568156713,1.481487950906677,-12.951339858118763,-0.8194527177326087,-0.785534117384859,-0.8194527177326087,-0.5690975365735472,1.082560051114431,0.4565170039224591,0.6039860903246793,0.4565170039224591,0.41475269482776805,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.802}",0.802,0.8778760099394222,0.3811099294970263,0.8778760099394222,0.2302587197880144,0.299848828420257,1.2427930981136923,1.0314141142767423,1.2427930981136923,0.6556382997277402,1.1548684879139228,1.9933635600320316,1.5269413829299525,1.9933635600320316,1.0606758001407206,43.48282871976298,0.43885059044515795,0.47334447773560245,0.43885059044515795,-0.16503260609401346,-0.9624,-0.7634452290189488,-0.03954825746553046,-0.7634452290189488,-0.07534730981913512

420,420,5,"'What then? Who then?' she said. 'Thirty-six; in a motor-car; a woman. Yes, but a million other things as well. A snob am I? The garter in the hall? The leopards? My ancestors? Proud of them? Yes! Greedy, luxurious, vicious? Am I? (here a new self came in). Don't care a damn if I am. Truthful? I think so. Generous? Oh, but that don't count (here a new self came in). Lying in bed of a morning listening to the pigeons on fine linen; silver dishes; wine; maids; footmen. Spoilt? Perhaps. Too many things for nothing. Hence my books (here she mentioned fifty classical titles; which represented, so we think, the early romantic works that she tore up). Facile, glib, romantic. But (here another self came in) a duffer, a fumbler. More clumsy I couldn't be. And--and--(here she hesitated for a word and if we suggest 'Love' we may be wrong, but certainly she laughed and blushed and then cried out--) A toad set in emeralds! Harry the Archduke! Blue-bottles on the ceiling! (here another self came in). But Nell, Kit, Sasha? (she was sunk in gloom: tears actually shaped themselves and she had long given over crying). Trees, she said. (Here another self came in.) I love trees (she was passing a clump) growing there a thousand years. And barns (she passed a tumbledown barn at the edge of the road). And sheep dogs (here one came trotting across the road. She carefully avoided it). And the night. But people (here another self came in). People? (She repeated it as a question.) I don't know. Chattering, spiteful, always telling lies. (Here she turned into the High Street of her native town, which was crowded, for it was market day, with farmers, and shepherds, and old women with hens in baskets.) I like peasants. I understand crops. But (here another self came skipping over the top of her mind like the beam from a lighthouse). Fame! (She laughed.) Fame! Seven editions. A prize. Photographs in the evening papers (here she alluded to the 'Oak Tree' and 'The Burdett Coutts' Memorial Prize which she had won; and we must snatch space to remark how discomposing it is for her biographer that this culmination to which the whole book moved, this peroration with which the book was to end, should be dashed from us on a laugh casually like this; but the truth is that when we write of a woman, everything is out of place--culminations and perorations; the accent never falls where it does with a man). Fame! she repeated. A poet--a charlatan; both every morning as regularly as the post comes in. To dine, to meet; to meet, to dine; fame--fame! (She had here to slow down to pass through the crowd of market people. But no one noticed her. A porpoise in a fishmonger's shop attracted far more attention than a lady who had won a prize and might, had she chosen, have worn three coronets one on top of another on her brow.) Driving very slowly she now hummed as if it were part of an old song, 'With my guineas I'll buy flowering trees, flowering trees, flowering trees and walk among my flowering trees and tell my sons what fame is'.

425,425,5,"Masterfully, swiftly, she drove up the curving drive between the elms and oaks through the falling turf of the park whose fall was so gentle that had it been water it would have spread the beach with a smooth green tide. Planted here and in solemn groups were beech trees and oak trees. The deer stepped among them, one white as snow, another with its head on one side, for some wire netting had caught in its horns. All this, the trees, deer, and turf, she observed with the greatest satisfaction as if her mind had become a fluid that flowed round things and enclosed them completely. Next minute she drew up in the courtyard where, for so many hundred years she had come, on horseback or in coach and six, with men riding before or coming after; where plumes had tossed, torches flashed, and the same flowering trees that let their leaves drop now had shaken their blossoms. Now she was alone. The autumn leaves were falling. The porter opened the great gates. 'Morning, James,' she said, 'there're some things in the car. Will you bring 'em in?' words of no beauty, interest, or significance themselves, it will be conceded, but now so plumped out with meaning that they fell like ripe nuts from a tree, and proved that when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly. This was true indeed of every movement and action now, usual though they were; so that to see Orlando change her skirt for a pair of whipcord breeches and leather jacket, which she did in less than three minutes, was to be ravished with the beauty of movement as if Madame Lopokova were using her highest art. Then she strode into the dining-room where her old friends Dryden, Pope, Swift, Addison regarded her demurely at first as who should say Here's the prize winner! but when they reflected that two hundred guineas was in question, they nodded their heads approvingly. Two hundred guineas, they seemed to say; two hundred guineas are not to be sniffed at. She cut herself a slice of bread and ham, clapped the two together and began to eat, striding up and down the room, thus shedding her company habits in a second, without thinking. After five or six such turns, she tossed off a glass of red Spanish wine, and, filling another which she carried in her hand, strode down the long corridor and through a dozen drawing-rooms and so began a perambulation of the house, attended by such elk-hounds and spaniels as chose to follow her.",masterfully  swiftly  she drove up the curving drive between the elms and oaks through the falling turf of the park whose fall was so gentle that had it been water it would have spread the beach with a smooth green tide  planted here and in solemn groups were beech trees and oak trees  the deer stepped among them  one white as snow  another with its head on one side  for some wire netting had caught in its horns  all this  the trees  deer  and turf  she observed with the greatest satisfaction as if her mind had become a fluid that flowed round things and enclosed them completely  next minute she drew up in the courtyard where  for so many hundred years she had come  on horseback or in coach and six  with men riding before or coming after  where plumes had tossed  torches flashed  and the same flowering trees that let their leaves drop now had shaken their blossoms  now she was alone  the autumn leaves were falling  the porter opened the great gates   morning  james   she said   there are some things in the car  will you bring  them in   words of no beauty  interest  or significance themselves  it will be conceded  but now so plumped out with meaning that they fell like ripe nuts from a tree  and proved that when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly  this was true indeed of every movement and action now  usual though they were  so that to see orlando change her skirt for a pair of whipcord breeches and leather jacket  which she did in less than three minutes  was to be ravished with the beauty of movement as if madame lopokova were using her highest art  then she strode into the dining room where her old friends dryden  pope  swift  addison regarded her demurely at first as who should say here is the prize winner  but when they reflected that two hundred guineas was in question  they nodded their heads approvingly  two hundred guineas  they seemed to say  two hundred guineas are not to be sniffed at  she cut herself a slice of bread and ham  clapped the two together and began to eat  striding up and down the room  thus shedding her company habits in a second  without thinking  after five or six such turns  she tossed off a glass of red spanish wine  and  filling another which she carried in her hand  strode down the long corridor and through a dozen drawing rooms and so began a perambulation of the house  attended by such elk hounds and spaniels as chose to follow her ,2467,439,9.4,2.193914988290184,2.484210526315789,2.193914988290184,0.5322465725507869,9.9,2.3586790933763733,2.5931034482758624,2.3586790933763733,0.5664816245230039,98.6495640980253,1.4494748264704043,1.4237388093814272,1.4494748264704043,0.46765187869562996,4.519444444444444,1.7969931849027314,2.0661851393297055,1.7969931849027314,0.45678697489748715,14.280000000000003,1.536872598569401,1.5111020574455087,1.536872598569401,0.138575659935112,80.76628786289146,2.011049154701489,2.6494672252695612,2.011049154701489,0.4520376551367058,2.4209852698139698,1.3349012025808642,1.350725464461106,1.3349012025808642,0.48383839521368227,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.992}",0.992,1.1664090074264224,0.5307810469100791,1.1664090074264224,0.05536101996274971,0.1382936507936508,0.16208871320215917,0.15520304217714095,0.16208871320215917,-0.09918563500083072,0.6505627833892279,0.7337220891351401,0.6471147960514828,0.7337220891351401,-0.06955205633248972,72.95235613039429,1.6031603728777737,1.3246488545788724,1.6031603728777737,-0.442293561525717,0.9997,1.4968602893125973,1.048014965703596,1.4968602893125973,0.45308410585497877
426,426,5,"This, too, was all in the day's routine. As soon would she come home and leave her own grandmother without a kiss as come back and leave the house unvisited. She fancied that the rooms brightened as she came in; stirred, opened their eyes as if they had been dozing in her absence. She fancied, too, that, hundreds and thousands of times as she had seen them, they never looked the same twice, as if so long a life as theirs had stored in them a myriad moods which changed with winter and summer, bright weather and dark, and her own fortunes and the people's characters who visited them. Polite, they always were to strangers, but a little weary: with her, they were entirely open and at their ease. Why not indeed? They had known each other for close on four centuries now. They had nothing to conceal. She knew their sorrows and joys. She knew what age each part of them was and its little secrets--a hidden drawer, a concealed cupboard, or some deficiency perhaps, such as a part made up, or added later. They, too, knew her in all her moods and changes. She had hidden nothing from them; had come to them as boy and woman, crying and dancing, brooding and gay. In this window-seat, she had written her first verses; in that chapel, she had been married. And she would be buried here, she reflected, kneeling on the window-sill in the long gallery and sipping her Spanish wine. Though she could hardly fancy it, the body of the heraldic leopard would be making yellow pools on the floor the day they lowered her to lie among her ancestors. She, who believed in no immortality, could not help feeling that her soul would come and go forever with the reds on the panels and the greens on the sofa. For the room--she had strolled into the Ambassador's bedroom--shone like a shell that has lain at the bottom of the sea for centuries and has been crusted over and painted a million tints by the water; it was rose and yellow, green and sand-coloured. It was frail as a shell, as iridescent and as empty. No Ambassador would ever sleep there again. Ah, but she knew where the heart of the house still beat. Gently opening a door, she stood on the threshold so that (as she fancied) the room could not see her and watched the tapestry rising and falling on the eternal faint breeze which never failed to move it. Still the hunter rode; still Daphne flew. The heart still beat, she thought, however faintly, however far withdrawn; the frail indomitable heart of the immense building.",this  too  was all in the day own routine  as soon would she come home and leave her own grandmother without a kiss as come back and leave the house unvisited  she fancied that the rooms brightened as she came in  stirred  opened their eyes as if they had been dozing in her absence  she fancied  too  that  hundreds and thousands of times as she had seen them  they never looked the same twice  as if so long a life as theirs had stored in them a myriad moods which changed with winter and summer  bright weather and dark  and her own fortunes and the people own characters who visited them  polite  they always were to strangers  but a little weary  with her  they were entirely open and at their ease  why not indeed  they had known each other for close on four centuries now  they had nothing to conceal  she knew their sorrows and joys  she knew what age each part of them was and its little secrets  a hidden drawer  a concealed cupboard  or some deficiency perhaps  such as a part made up  or added later  they  too  knew her in all her moods and changes  she had hidden nothing from them  had come to them as boy and woman  crying and dancing  brooding and gay  in this window seat  she had written her first verses  in that chapel  she had been married  and she would be buried here  she reflected  kneeling on the window sill in the long gallery and sipping her spanish wine  though she could hardly fancy it  the body of the heraldic leopard would be making yellow pools on the floor the day they lowered her to lie among her ancestors  she  who believed in no immortality  could not help feeling that her soul would come and go forever with the reds on the panels and the greens on the sofa  for the room  she had strolled into the ambassador own bedroom  shone like a she will that has lain at the bottom of the sea for centuries and has been crusted over and painted a million tints by the water  it was rose and yellow  green and sand coloured  it was frail as a she will  as iridescent and as empty  no ambassador would ever sleep there again  ah  but she knew where the heart of the house still beat  gently opening a door  she stood on the threshold so that  as she fancied  the room could not see her and watched the tapestry rising and falling on the eternal faint breeze which never failed to move it  still the hunter rode  still daphne flew  the heart still beat  she thought  however faintly  however far withdrawn  the frail indomitable heart of the immense building ,2480,450,-4.55,-1.3884615419406874,-1.431578947368421,-1.3884615419406874,-0.5153773328920981,-4.05,-1.2868732768773024,-1.2551724137931033,-1.2868732768773024,-0.4206169613228605,-56.0742576804203,-0.7789225661342135,-0.8092797732744066,-0.7789225661342135,-0.25932420328505595,1.7422619047619043,0.5855267662799938,0.7221757799469614,0.5855267662799938,0.06538356938459569,5.540000000000003,0.11163576565862394,0.3241664969104371,0.11163576565862394,-0.35580994013238204,-18.594966739212577,-0.9899040708314051,-0.992388114710826,-0.9899040708314051,-0.5044251980415789,-0.48127842619814115,-0.5698018284887174,-0.2685167208024965,-0.5698018284887174,-0.0938332119953144,"{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.2536}",-0.2536,-0.7251525803094073,-0.45043128914096653,-0.7251525803094073,-0.3420447561946806,0.07576754385964915,-0.2561723349902985,-0.18391371035108814,-0.2561723349902985,-0.21050601309642739,0.34657800972116326,-0.0255630508066967,0.11677400577334972,-0.0255630508066967,-0.2954426261644038,72.51261621385326,1.5857867150168703,1.3119458169492624,1.5857867150168703,-0.5012405567871637,0.5676,0.9990885067984233,0.8085082796369432,0.9990885067984233,0.37023841082294384
427,427,5,"Now, calling her troop of dogs to her she passed down the gallery whose floor was laid with whole oak trees sawn across. Rows of chairs with all their velvets faded stood ranged against the wall holding their arms out for Elizabeth, for James, for Shakespeare it might be, for Cecil, who never came. The sight made her gloomy. She unhooked the rope that fenced them off. She sat on the Queen's chair; she opened a manuscript book lying on Lady Betty's table; she stirred her fingers in the aged rose leaves; she brushed her short hair with King James' silver brushes: she bounced up and down upon his bed (but no King would ever sleep there again, for all Louise's new sheets) and pressed her cheek against the worn silver counterpane that lay upon it. But everywhere were little lavender bags to keep the moth out and printed notices, 'Please do not touch', which, though she had put them there herself, seemed to rebuke her. The house was no longer hers entirely, she sighed. It belonged to time now; to history; was past the touch and control of the living. Never would beer be spilt here any more, she thought (she was in the bedroom that had been old Nick Greene's), or holes burnt in the carpet. Never two hundred servants come running and brawling down the corridors with warming pans and great branches for the great fireplaces. Never would ale be brewed and candles made and saddles fashioned and stone shaped in the workshops outside the house. Hammers and mallets were silent now. Chairs and beds were empty; tankards of silver and gold were locked in glass cases. The great wings of silence beat up and down the empty house.",now  calling her troop of dogs to her she passed down the gallery whose floor was laid with whole oak trees sawn across  rows of chairs with all their velvets faded stood ranged against the wall holding their arms out for elizabeth  for james  for shakespeare it might be  for cecil  who never came  the sight made her gloomy  she unhooked the rope that fenced them off  she sat on the queen own chair  she opened a manuscript book lying on lady betty own table  she stirred her fingers in the aged rose leaves  she brushed her short hair with king james  silver brushes  she bounced up and down upon his bed  but no king would ever sleep there again  for all louise own new sheets  and pressed her cheek against the worn silver counterpane that lay upon it  but everywhere were little lavender bags to keep the moth out and printed notices   please do not touch   which  though she had put them there herself  seemed to rebuke her  the house was no longer hers entirely  she sighed  it belonged to time now  to history  was past the touch and control of the living  never would beer be spilt here any more  she thought  she was in the bedroom that had been old nick greene own   or holes burnt in the carpet  never two hundred servants come running and brawling down the corridors with warming pans and great branches for the great fireplaces  never would ale be brewed and candles made and saddles fashioned and stone shaped in the workshops outside the house  hammers and mallets were silent now  chairs and beds were empty  tankards of silver and gold were locked in glass cases  the great wings of silence beat up and down the empty house ,1636,292,1.9000000000000004,0.2679061010692855,0.3789473684210527,0.2679061010692855,0.03689069937770766,0.9000000000000004,0.006709822244969575,0.11034482758620699,0.006709822244969575,-0.042618836225966225,14.946880011860767,0.24395365443843622,0.2157176602514727,0.24395365443843622,0.10652700812337941,1.404166666666666,0.43804239267613954,0.5585555793048095,0.43804239267613954,0.12248667458107934,13.335,1.3827709043931207,1.3827663475249545,1.3827709043931207,0.4598785829686071,-6.373340285231087,-0.6207810210550464,-0.5444328655252393,-0.6207810210550464,-0.42166064476673465,1.0362051004483646,0.4260950904484846,0.5781235569796064,0.4260950904484846,0.31134046982024965,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.9136}",0.9136,1.0473511810949443,0.46902201740911414,1.0473511810949443,0.17769571988453614,0.19140928515928518,0.5173995104764479,0.44328113175920003,0.5173995104764479,0.15928230328732107,0.8730399291515445,1.2894196285732722,1.0352549778069278,1.2894196285732722,0.40903145259748186,50.42864822182041,0.7132725545496533,0.6739926408524524,0.7132725545496533,-0.3659991237332254,-0.9998,-0.8065293870055958,-0.0602785283724798,-0.8065293870055958,-0.011848561964223051
428,428,5,"So she sat at the end of the gallery with her dogs couched round her, in Queen Elizabeth's hard armchair. The gallery stretched far away to a point where the light almost failed. It was as a tunnel bored deep into the past. As her eyes peered down it, she could see people laughing and talking; the great men she had known; Dryden, Swift, and Pope; and statesmen in colloquy; and lovers dallying in the window-seats; and people eating and drinking at the long tables; and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making them sneeze and cough. Still further down, she saw sets of splendid dancers formed for the quadrille. A fluty, frail, but nevertheless stately music began to play. An organ boomed. A coffin was borne into the chapel. A marriage procession came out of it. Armed men with helmets left for the wars. They brought banners back from Flodden and Poitiers and stuck them on the wall. The long gallery filled itself thus, and still peering further, she thought she could make out at the very end, beyond the Elizabethans and the Tudors, some one older, further, darker, a cowled figure, monastic, severe, a monk, who went with his hands clasped, and a book in them, murmuring--",so she sat at the end of the gallery with her dogs couched round her  in queen elizabeth own hard armchair  the gallery stretched far away to a point where the light almost failed  it was as a tunnel bored deep into the past  as her eyes peered down it  she could see people laughing and talking  the great men she had known  dryden  swift  and pope  and statesmen in colloquy  and lovers dallying in the window seats  and people eating and drinking at the long tables  and the wood smoke curling round their heads and making them sneeze and cough  still further down  she saw sets of splendid dancers formed for the quadrille  a fluty  frail  but nevertheless stately music began to play  an organ boomed  a coffin was borne into the chapel  a marriage procession came out of it  armed men with helmets left for the wars  they brought banners back from flodden and poitiers and stuck them on the wall  the long gallery filled itself thus  and still peering further  she thought she could make out at the very end  beyond the elizabethans and the tudors  some one older  further  darker  a cowled figure  monastic  severe  a monk  who went with his hands clasped  and a book in them  murmuring  ,1193,211,0.09999999999999976,-0.19433603186373033,-0.1263157894736843,-0.19433603186373033,-0.16360240435726345,-0.6500000000000002,-0.39835155222766117,-0.3172413793103449,-0.39835155222766117,-0.23542424414647595,-47.160229743439764,-0.6505389960798486,-0.6806299648558056,-0.6505389960798486,-0.4651419292583209,1.148214285714286,0.3263904901239266,0.4346881738890967,0.3263904901239266,0.1610582988070831,8.066999999999998,0.5237151108263044,0.6673456915868812,0.5237151108263044,0.2780524913373006,32.549345107577324,0.5547793997921057,0.8821875028650593,0.5547793997921057,0.32588655448996856,-0.3662136980251081,-0.49428693409041774,-0.20431936266799053,-0.49428693409041774,-0.15227367589393803,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.6374}",-0.6374,-1.3079892352331481,-0.7527669463153335,-1.3079892352331481,-0.6879400358344183,0.043888888888888894,-0.46942085303908626,-0.3568108644960445,-0.46942085303908626,-0.18042134919515038,0.20427528206842652,-0.38100304596216594,-0.13149152454066024,-0.38100304596216594,-0.23261634504244044,38.81865199066146,0.25457391315007666,0.3386075337552175,0.25457391315007666,-0.23412534998718518,-0.8353,-0.6170282108343815,0.03090140649899528,-0.6170282108343815,-0.05546113930014263
429,429,5,"Like thunder, the stable clock struck four. Never did any earthquake so demolish a whole town. The gallery and all its occupants fell to powder. Her own face, that had been dark and sombre as she gazed, was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder. In this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness. She saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue sheen on their bodies; she saw a knot in the wood where her foot was, and her dog's ear twitching. At the same time, she heard a bough creaking in the garden, a sheep coughing in the park, a swift screaming past the window. Her own body quivered and tingled as if suddenly stood naked in a hard frost. Yet, she kept, as she had not done when the clock struck ten in London, complete composure (for she was now one and entire, and presented, it may be, a larger surface to the shock of time). She rose, but without precipitation, called her dogs, and went firmly but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden. Here the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct. She noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye. She saw the intricacy of the twigs of every tree. Each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of veins and petals. She saw Stubbs, the gardener, coming along the path, and every button on his gaiters was visible; she saw Betty and Prince, the cart horses, and never had she marked so clearly the white star on Betty's forehead, and the three long hairs that fell down below the rest on Prince's tail. Out in the quadrangle the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new photograph; she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a dance tune that people were listening to in the red velvet opera house at Vienna. Braced and strung up by the present moment she was also strangely afraid, as if whenever the gulf of time gaped and let a second through some unknown danger might come with it. The tension was too relentless and too rigorous to be endured long without discomfort. She walked more briskly than she liked, as if her legs were moved for her, through the garden and out into the park. Here she forced herself, by a great effort, to stop by the carpenter's shop, and to stand stock-still watching Joe Stubbs fashion a cart wheel. She was standing with her eye fixed on his hand when the quarter struck. It hurtled through her like a meteor, so hot that no fingers can hold it. She saw with disgusting vividness that the thumb on Joe's right hand was without a finger nail and there was a raised saucer of pink flesh where the nail should have been. The sight was so repulsive that she felt faint for a moment, but in that moment's darkness, when her eyelids flickered, she was relieved of the pressure of the present. There was something strange in the shadow that the flicker of her eyes cast, something which (as anyone can test for himself by looking now at the sky) is always absent from the present--whence its terror, its nondescript character--something one trembles to pin through the body with a name and call beauty, for it has no body, is as a shadow without substance or quality of its own, yet has the power to change whatever it adds itself to. This shadow now, while she flickered her eye in her faintness in the carpenter's shop, stole out, and attaching itself to the innumerable sights she had been receiving, composed them into something tolerable, comprehensible. Her mind began to toss like the sea. Yes, she thought, heaving a deep sigh of relief, as she turned from the carpenter's shop to climb the hill, I can begin to live again. I am by the Serpentine, she thought, the little boat is climbing through the white arch of a thousand deaths. I am about to understand...",like thunder  the stable clock struck four  never did any earthquake so demolish a whole town  the gallery and all its occupants fell to powder  her own face  that had been dark and sombre as she gazed  was lit as by an explosion of gunpowder  in this same light everything near her showed with extreme distinctness  she saw two flies circling round and noticed the blue sheen on their bodies  she saw a knot in the wood where her foot was  and her dog own ear twitching  at the same time  she heard a bough creaking in the garden  a sheep coughing in the park  a swift screaming past the window  her own body quivered and tingled as if suddenly stood naked in a hard frost  yet  she kept  as she had not done when the clock struck ten in london  complete composure  for she was now one and entire  and presented  it may be  a larger surface to the shock of time   she rose  but without precipitation  called her dogs  and went firmly but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden  here the shadows of the plants were miraculously distinct  she noticed the separate grains of earth in the flower beds as if she had a microscope stuck to her eye  she saw the intricacy of the twigs of every tree  each blade of grass was distinct and the marking of veins and petals  she saw stubbs  the gardener  coming along the path  and every button on his gaiters was visible  she saw betty and prince  the cart horses  and never had she marked so clearly the white star on betty own forehead  and the three long hairs that fell down below the rest on prince own tail  out in the quadrangle the old grey walls of the house looked like a scraped new photograph  she heard the loud speaker condensing on the terrace a dance tune

430,430,5,"Those were her words, spoken quite distinctly, but we cannot conceal the fact that she was now a very indifferent witness to the truth of what was before her and might easily have mistaken a sheep for a cow, or an old man called Smith for one who was called Jones and was no relation of his whatever. For the shadow of faintness which the thumb without a nail had cast had deepened now, at the back of her brain (which is the part furthest from sight), into a pool where things dwell in darkness so deep that what they are we scarcely know. She now looked down into this pool or sea in which everything is reflected--and, indeed, some say that all our most violent passions, and art and religion, are the reflections which we see in the dark hollow at the back of the head when the visible world is obscured for the time. She looked there now, long, deeply, profoundly, and immediately the ferny path up the hill along which she was walking became not entirely a path, but partly the Serpentine; the hawthorn bushes were partly ladies and gentlemen sitting with card-cases and gold-mounted canes; the sheep were partly tall Mayfair houses; everything was partly something else, as if her mind had become a forest with glades branching here and there; things came nearer, and further, and mingled and separated and made the strangest alliances and combinations in an incessant chequer of light and shade.

431,431,5,"The ferny path led, with many turns and windings, higher and higher to the oak tree, which stood on the top. The tree had grown bigger, sturdier, and more knotted since she had known it, somewhere about the year     , but it was still in the prime of life. The little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering thickly on its branches. Flinging herself on the ground, she felt the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way and that beneath her. She liked to think that she was riding the back of the world. She liked to attach herself to something hard. As she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her leather jacket--her poem 'The Oak Tree'. 'I should have brought a trowel,' she reflected. The earth was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could do as she meant and bury the book here. Besides, the dogs would dig it up. No luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations, she thought. Perhaps it would be as well then to do without them. She had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to speak over the book as she buried it. (It was a copy of the first edition, signed by author and artist.) 'I bury this as a tribute,' she was going to have said, 'a return to the land of what the land has given me,' but Lord! once one began mouthing words aloud, how silly they sounded! She was reminded of old Greene getting upon a platform the other day comparing her with Milton (save for his blindness) and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas. She had thought then, of the oak tree here on its hill, and what has that got to do with this, she had wondered? What has praise and fame to do with poetry? What has seven editions (the book had already gone into no less) got to do with the value of it? Was not writing poetry a secret transaction, a voice answering a voice? So that all this chatter and praise and blame and meeting people who admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill suited as could be to the thing itself--a voice answering a voice. What could have been more secret, she thought, more slow, and like the intercourse of lovers, than the stammering answer she had made all these years to the old crooning song of the woods, and the farms and the brown horses standing at the gate, neck to neck, and the smithy and the kitchen and the fields, so laboriously bearing wheat, turnips, grass, and the garden blowing irises and fritillaries?",the ferny path led  with many turns and windings  higher and higher to the oak tree  which stood on the top  the tree had grown bigger  sturdier  and more knotted since she had known it  somewhere about the year       but it was still in the prime of life  the little sharply frilled leaves were still fluttering thickly on its branches  flinging herself on the ground  she felt the bones of the tree running out like ribs from a spine this way and that beneath her  she liked to think that she was riding the back of the world  she liked to attach herself to something hard  as she flung herself down a little square book bound in red cloth fell from the breast of her leather jacket  her poem  the oak tree    i should have brought a trowel   she reflected  the earth was so shallow over the roots that it seemed doubtful if she could do as she meant and bury the book here  besides  the dogs would dig it up  no luck ever attends these symbolical celebrations  she thought  perhaps it would be as well then to do without them  she had a little speech on the tip of her tongue which she meant to speak over the book as she buried it   it was a copy of the first edition  signed by author and artist    i bury this as a tribute   she was going to have said   a return to the land of what the land has given me   but lord  once one began mouthing words aloud  how silly they sounded  she was reminded of old greene getting upon a platform the other day comparing her with milton  save for his blindness  and handing her a cheque for two hundred guineas  she had thought then  of the oak tree here on its hill  and what has that got to do with this  she had wondered  what has praise and fame to do with poetry  what has seven editions  the book had already gone into no less  got to do with the value of it  was not writing poetry a secret transaction  a voice answering a voice  so that all this chatter and praise and blame and meeting people who admired one and meeting people who did not admire one was as ill suited as could be to the thing itself  a voice answering a voice  what could have been more secret  she thought  more slow  and like the intercourse of lovers  than the stammering answer she had made all these years to the old crooning song of the woods  and the farms and the brown horses standing at the gate  neck to neck  and the smithy and the kitchen and the fields  so laboriously bearing wheat  turnips  grass  and the garden blowing irises and fritillaries ,2481,466,4.800000000000001,1.0126295374613663,1.192982456140351,1.0126295374613663,0.16296350470681456,4.800000000000001,1.0258965064019112,1.1862068965517243,1.0258965064019112,0.18320775671424575,41.979593884239634,0.6332901406745051,0.6058615419290999,0.6332901406745051,0.18747542603272818,1.201730952380954,0.34973560466965836,0.46058740804285536,0.34973560466965836,-0.013399076445482699,13.591,1.4245169718101869,1.4175324234399402,1.4245169718101869,0.05633267207673754,80.51365603005706,2.0034190546524036,2.640207593905793,2.0034190546524036,0.4044828589485057,4.162444681903158,2.477789433325934,2.3223272344359724,2.477789433325934,0.7836736788220042,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9864}",0.9864,1.157904876974174,0.5263696876600104,1.157904876974174,0.035240024246730256,-0.001926523297491037,-0.7758976715090372,-0.6052954505072443,-0.7758976715090372,-0.341456098190742,-0.05030956098334138,-1.0168983437796424,-0.5756477407475293,-1.0168983437796424,-0.5741403960365492,76.04466245784616,1.7253341172056729,1.4139782107785317,1.7253341172056729,-0.47729811636844705,-0.9969,-0.8031886367873798,-0.05867110094921367,-0.8031886367873798,0.09291897883734718
432,432,5,"So she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground, and watched the vast view, varied like an ocean floor this evening with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it. There was a village with a church tower among elm trees; a grey domed manor house in a park; a spark of light burning on some glass-house; a farmyard with yellow corn stacks. The fields were marked with black tree clumps, and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands, and there was the gleam of a river, and then hills again. In the far distance Snowdon's crags broke white among the clouds; she saw the far Scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the Hebrides. She listened for the sound of gun-firing out at sea. No--only the wind blew. There was no war to-day. Drake had gone; Nelson had gone. 'And there', she thought, letting her eyes, which had been looking at these far distances, drop once more to the land beneath her, 'was my land once: that Castle between the downs was mine; and all that moor running almost to the sea was mine.' Here the landscape (it must have been some trick of the fading light) shook itself, heaped itself, let all this encumbrance of houses, castles, and woods slide off its tent-shaped sides. The bare mountains of Turkey were before her. It was blazing noon. She looked straight at the baked hill-side. Goats cropped the sandy tufts at her feet. An eagle soared above. The raucous voice of old Rustum, the gipsy, croaked in her ears, 'What is your antiquity and your race, and your possessions compared with this? What do you need with four hundred bedrooms and silver lids on all your dishes, and housemaids dusting?'",so she let her book lie unburied and dishevelled on the ground  and watched the vast view  varied like an ocean floor this evening with the sun lightening it and the shadows darkening it  there was a village with a church tower among elm trees  a grey domed manor house in a park  a spark of light burning on some glass house  a farmyard with yellow corn stacks  the fields were marked with black tree clumps  and beyond the fields stretched long woodlands  and there was the gleam of a river  and then hills again  in the far distance snowdon own crags broke white among the clouds  she saw the far scottish hills and the wild tides that swirl about the hebrides  she listened for the sound of gun firing out at sea  no  only the wind blew  there was no war to day  drake had gone  nelson had gone   and there   she thought  letting her eyes  which had been looking at these far distances  drop once more to the land beneath her   was my land once  that castle between the downs was mine  and all that moor running almost to the sea was mine   here the landscape  it must have been some trick of the fading light  shook itself  heaped itself  let all this encumbrance of houses  castles  and woods slide off its tent shaped sides  the bare mountains of turkey were before her  it was blazing noon  she looked straight at the baked hill side  goats cropped the sandy tufts at her feet  an eagle soared above  the raucous voice of old rustum  the gipsy  croaked in her ears   what is your antiquity and your race  and your possessions compared with this  what do you need with four hundred bedrooms and silver lids on all your dishes  and housemaids dusting  ,1656,295,-3.75,-1.1830205939704581,-1.207017543859649,-1.1830205939704581,-0.6018086919868848,-3.75,-1.2084743011729224,-1.1724137931034482,-1.2084743011729224,-0.5367447146170696,-59.60872519204906,-0.829827450053365,-0.8602902223606624,-0.829827450053365,-0.42051341118475316,-2.4458333333333324,-1.2414099461790145,-1.304640649134339,-1.2414099461790145,-0.67576212900127,1.2589999999999995,-0.5864693695463006,-0.2572146397772799,-0.5864693695463006,-0.5524972591692292,6.365199360234161,-0.23604592697111876,-0.07753136737922953,-0.23604592697111876,-0.2374006020652252,-1.0326263426178923,-0.9316414673270403,-0.5761268825706249,-0.9316414673270403,-0.30710994914603773,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.024, 'compound': -0.9022}",-0.9022,-1.7101131180466098,-0.9613612194257355,-1.7101131180466098,-0.6932118726087696,0.1101449275362319,-0.02620886475763243,0.002535555155319233,-0.02620886475763243,-0.0548897875800608,0.442857382086817,0.2149210229120508,0.2847458347954153,0.2149210229120508,-0.0634293565718071,50.77079517871304,0.726790418049423,0.6838764505881056,0.726790418049423,-0.3729761284812559,-0.9673,-0.7690899449049001,-0.042264255525531855,-0.7690899449049001,-2.4655537588204157e-05

The present showered down upon her head once more, but now that the light was fading, gentlier than before, calling into view nothing detailed, nothing small, but only misty fields, cottages with lamps in them, the slumbering bulk of a wood, and a fan-shaped light pushing the darkness before it along some lane. Whether it had struck nine, ten, or eleven, she could not say. Night had come--night that she loved of all times, night in which the reflections in the dark pool of the mind shine more clearly than by day. It was not necessary to faint now in order to look deep into the darkness where things shape themselves and to see in the pool of the mind now Shakespeare, now a girl in Russian trousers, now a toy boat on the Serpentine, and then the Atlantic itself, where it storms in great waves past Cape Horn. She looked into the darkness. There was her husband's brig, rising to the top of the wave! Up, it went, and up and up. The white arch of a thousand deaths rose before it. Oh rash, oh ridiculous man, always sailing, so uselessly, round Cape Horn in the teeth of a gale!
