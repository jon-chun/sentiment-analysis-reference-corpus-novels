Connectivity will be such that individual nodes of the subjective will merge into an ocean of thought, of which our Internet is the crude precursor. As we come to inhabit each other's minds, we will be incapable of deceit. Our narratives will no longer record endless misunderstanding. Our literatures will lose their unwholesome nourishment. The lapidary haiku, the still, clear perception and celebration of things as they are, will be the only necessary form.

But look, Charlie, none of us, especially Miranda, can live with this threat, however improbable it is. Her freedom has been compromised. she is in a state of constant anxiety. It could go on for months, even years. it is simply not endurable. that is my general point. So. My first task was to find the best possible likeness of Peter Gorringe. I went on the website of his and Miranda's old school, found the year photographs and there he was, a great lump in the back row. I found him again in the school magazine, in articles about the rugby and cricket seasons. Then, of course, the press coverage during the trial. A lot of head-under-the-blanket, but I found some useful shots and merged what I had into a composite, high-definition portrait and scanned it. Next, and this was the enjoyable part, I devised some very specialised face-recognition software. Then I hacked into the Salisbury District Council CCTV system. I set the recognition algorithms to work, mining the period since he came out of prison. That was a bit tricky. There were various setbacks and software glitches, mostly due to problems marrying up with the city's outdated programs. Using Gorringe's surname to locate his parents' house on the edge of town was a great help, even though there are no cameras where they live. I needed to know his most likely route past the nearest camera. At last I was getting good matches and I have been able to pick him up in various places when he arrives by bus into town. I can follow him from street to street, camera to camera, as long as he is in or near the centre. there is one place he keeps returning to. do not trouble your head trying to guess what it is. His parents are still abroad. Perhaps they prefer to stay clear of their convict son. I have come to certain conclusions about him that make me think it is safe to pay a visit. I have told Miranda everything that I have told you. She knows only what you know. I will not say more at this stage. I simply ask you to trust me. Now, Charlie, please. I am desperate to hear your thoughts about Hamlet, about Shakespeare playing his father's ghost in the first production.

I put myself down as Church of England and started going every day to evensong. I still go every day, to the cathedral. At first it was boring but better than the cell. Then a little less boring. Then I started to get drawn in. It was the vicar mostly, at least at the beginning, the Reverend Wilfred Murray, a big fellow with a Liverpool accent. He was not scared of anyone, and that was something in a place like that. He started taking an interest in me when he saw I was serious. He sometimes dropped by my cell. He gave me passages to read from the Bible, mostly from the New Testament. After evensong on Thursdays he would go through them with me and a few others. I never thought I would find myself volunteering for a Bible-study group. And it was not for the benefit of the parole board, the way it was for some. But the more I became aware of God's presence in my life, the worse I felt about Mariam. I understood from Reverend Murray that I had a mountain to climb in coming to terms with what I would done, that forgiveness was a long way off but that I could work towards it.

I would broken the law and therefore I was a criminal and, as the authorities had considered for a long while, a security risk. From my war work, obviously, I knew a lot of secrets. It was that old recursive nonsense--the state makes a crime of what you do, what you are, then disowns you for being vulnerable to blackmail. The conventional view was that homosexuality was a revolting crime, a perversion of all that was good and a threat to the social order. But in certain enlightened, scientifically objective circles, it was a sickness and the sufferer should not be blamed. Fortunately, a cure was on hand. It was explained to me that if I pleaded or was found guilty, I could choose to be treated rather than punished. Begular injections of oestrogen. Chemical castration, so-called. I knew I was not ill, but I decided to go for it. Not simply to stay out of prison. I was curious. I could rise above the whole business by regarding it as an experiment. What could a complex compound like a hormone do to a body and a mind? I would make my own observations. Hard now, looking back, to feel the attraction of what I thought then. In those days I had a highly mechanistic view of what a person was. The body was a machine, an extraordinary one, and the mind I thought of mostly in terms of intelligence, which was best modelled by reference to chess or maths.

I pleaded guilty to avoid a trial, and refused the treatment. In retrospect, though it did not seem like it at the time, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. For all but two months of my year in Wandsworth, I had a cell to myself. Being cut off from experimental work, wet-bench stuff and all the usual obligations, I turned back to mathematics. Because of the war, quantum mechanics was moribund from neglect. There were some curious contradictions that I wanted to explore. I was interested in Paul Dirac's work. Above all, I wanted to understand what quantum mechanics could teach computer science. Few interruptions, of course. Access to a few books. People from King's and Manchester and elsewhere came to visit. My friends never let me down. As for the intelligence world, they had me where they wanted me and they left me alone, f was free! I did my best year's work since we broke the Enigma code in ' . Or since the computer logic papers I wrote in the mid-thirties. I even made some headway with the P versus NP problem, though it was not formulated in those terms for another fifteen years. I was excited by Crick and Watson's paper on the structure of DNA.

I hen we settled down to serious artificial intelligence, and this is the point of my story. At the start, we thought we were within ten years of replicating the human brain. But every tiny problem we solved, a million others would pop up. Have you any idea what it takes to catch a ball, or raise a cup to your lips, or make immediate sense of a word, a phrase or an ambiguous sentence? We did not, not at first. Solving maths problems is the tiniest fraction of what human intelligence does. We learned from a new angle just how wondrous a thing the brain is.
