But beyond the currents of disheartening facts about human nature and societies and daily bad news, there can be mightier stirrings, positive developments that are lost to view. The world is so connected now, however crudely, and change is so widely distributed that progress is hard to perceive. I do not like to boast, but one of those changes is right in front of you. The implications of intelligent machines are so immense that we have no idea what you--civilisation, that is--have set in motion. One anxiety is that it will be a shock and an insult to live with entities that are cleverer than you are. But already almost everyone knows someone cleverer than themselves.

Of course, goodness is on show too, and heroism, grace, wisdom, truth. Out of this rich tangle have come literary traditions, flourishing, like the wild flowers in Darwin's famous hedgerow. Novels ripe with tension, concealment and violence as well as moments of love and perfect formal resolution. But when the marriage of men and women to machines is complete, this literature will be redundant because we will understand each other too well. we will inhabit a community of minds to which we have immediate access. Connectivity will be such that individual nodes of the subjective will merge into an ocean of thought, of which our Internet is the crude precursor. As we come to inhabit each other's minds, we will be incapable of deceit. Our narratives will no longer record endless misunderstanding. Our literatures will lose their unwholesome nourishment. The lapidary haiku, the still, clear perception and celebration of things as they are, will be the only necessary form. I am sure we will treasure the literature of the past, even as it horrifies us. we will look back and marvel at how well the people of long ago depicted their own shortcomings, how they wove brilliant, even optimistic fables out of their conflicts and monstrous inadequacies and mutual incomprehension.""",0.9983633756637573,4.954124748706818,0.7067380547523499,0.9950007796287537,1.7283073663711548,0.9993953704833984,1,-1.614855706691742

It helped that I could see Gorringe across the courtroom. I let my hatred drive me on. I thought he was pathetic when he came up with the story about the texts I was supposed to have sent to a friend called Amelia. It was easy enough to prove she did not exist. Not all the press took my side. Some court reporters thought I was a malicious liar. The judge was very old school. In his summing-up he said that I would knowingly put myself at risk, taking alcohol to a young man's rooms. The jury still brought in a unanimous verdict. But when it came to sentencing, I was disappointed. Six years. Gorringe was just nineteen. With good behaviour, he would be out at the age of twenty-two. He paid a bargain price for obliterating Mariam's existence. But if I hated him with such ferocity, it was also because I knew that he and I were partners, bound forever, complicit in Mariam's lonely death. And now he wants justice.""",-0.9797160029411316,0.8876393437385559,1.2381873279809952,-0.917264461517334,-1.514659583568573,-0.9838250875473022,-1,-1.701890766620636

It could go on for months, even years. it is simply not endurable. that is my general point. So. My first task was to find the best possible likeness of Peter Gorringe. I went on the website of his and Miranda's old school, found the year photographs and there he was, a great lump in the back row. I found him again in the school magazine, in articles about the rugby and cricket seasons. Then, of course, the press coverage during the trial. A lot of head-under-the-blanket, but I found some useful shots and merged what I had into a composite, high-definition portrait and scanned it. Next, and this was the enjoyable part, I devised some very specialised face-recognition software. Then I hacked into the Salisbury District Council CCTV system. I set the recognition algorithms to work, mining the period since he came out of prison. That was a bit tricky. There were various setbacks and software glitches, mostly due to problems marrying up with the city's outdated programs. Using Gorringe's surname to locate his parents' house on the edge of town was a great help, even though there are no cameras where they live. I needed to know his most likely route past the nearest camera. At last I was getting good matches and I have been able to pick him up in various places when he arrives by bus into town. I can follow him from street to street, camera to camera, as long as he is in or near the centre. there is one place he keeps returning to. do not trouble your head trying to guess what it is. His parents are still abroad. Perhaps they prefer to stay clear of their convict son. I have come to certain conclusions about him that make me think it is safe to pay a visit. I have told Miranda everything that I have told you. She knows only what you know. I will not say more at this stage. I simply ask you to trust me. Now, Charlie, please. I am desperate to hear your thoughts about Hamlet, about Shakespeare playing his father's ghost in the first production.

I put myself down as Church of England and started going every day to evensong. I still go every day, to the cathedral. At first it was boring but better than the cell. Then a little less boring. Then I started to get drawn in. It was the vicar mostly, at least at the beginning, the Reverend Wilfred Murray, a big fellow with a Liverpool accent. He was not scared of anyone, and that was something in a place like that. He started taking an interest in me when he saw I was serious. He sometimes dropped by my cell. He gave me passages to read from the Bible, mostly from the New Testament. After evensong on Thursdays he would go through them with me and a few others. I never thought I would find myself volunteering for a Bible-study group. And it was not for the benefit of the parole board, the way it was for some. But the more I became aware of God's presence in my life, the worse I felt about Mariam.

The conventional view was that homosexuality was a revolting crime, a perversion of all that was good and a threat to the social order. But in certain enlightened, scientifically objective circles, it was a sickness and the sufferer should not be blamed. Fortunately, a cure was on hand. It was explained to me that if I pleaded or was found guilty, I could choose to be treated rather than punished. Begular injections of oestrogen. Chemical castration, so-called. I knew I was not ill, but I decided to go for it. Not simply to stay out of prison. I was curious. I could rise above the whole business by regarding it as an experiment. What could a complex compound like a hormone do to a body and a mind? I would make my own observations. Hard now, looking back, to feel the attraction of what I thought then. In those days I had a highly mechanistic view of what a person was.

Your body will change radically. You might grow breasts. You could become severely depressed. I listened, resisted, but in the end, I came round. I pleaded guilty to avoid a trial, and refused the treatment. In retrospect, though it did not seem like it at the time, it was one of the best decisions I ever made. For all but two months of my year in Wandsworth, I had a cell to myself. Being cut off from experimental work, wet-bench stuff and all the usual obligations, I turned back to mathematics. Because of the war, quantum mechanics was moribund from neglect. There were some curious contradictions that I wanted to explore. I was interested in Paul Dirac's work. Above all, I wanted to understand what quantum mechanics could teach computer science. Few interruptions, of course. Access to a few books. People from King's and Manchester and elsewhere came to visit. My friends never let me down. As for the intelligence world, they had me where they wanted me and they left me alone, f was free! I did my best year's work since we broke the Enigma code in ' . Or since the computer logic papers I wrote in the mid-thirties.
