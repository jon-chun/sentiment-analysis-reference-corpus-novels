 Howards End,

 Tuesday.

 Dearest Meg,

 It isn t going to be what we expected. It is old and little, and
altogether delightful--red brick. We can scarcely pack in as it is,
and the dear knows what will happen when Paul (younger son) arrives
to-morrow. From hall you go right or left into dining-room or
drawing-room. Hall itself is practically a room. You open another door
in it, and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the
first-floor. Three bed-rooms in a row there, and three attics in a
row above. That isn t all the house really, but it s all that one
notices--nine windows as you look up from the front garden.

 Then there s a very big wych-elm--to the left as you look up--leaning
a little over the house, and standing on the boundary between the garden
and meadow. quite love that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks--no
nastier than ordinary oaks--pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No
silver birches, though. However, must get on to my host and hostess. only wanted to show that it isn t the least what we expected. Why did
we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles, and their
garden all gamboge-coloured paths? believe simply because we associate
them with expensive hotels--Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses
down long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc. We females are
that unjust.

 shall be back Saturday; will let you know train later. They are as
angry as am that you did not come too; really Tibby is too tiresome,
he starts a new mortal disease every month. How could he have got hay
fever in London? and even if he could, it seems hard that you should
give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze. Tell him that Charles Wilcox
(the son who is here) has hay fever too, but he s brave, and gets quite
cross when we inquire after it. Men like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a
power of good. But you won t agree, and d better change the subject.

 This long letter is because m writing before breakfast. Oh, the
beautiful vine leaves! The house is covered with a vine. looked out
earlier, and Mrs. Wilcox was already in the garden. She evidently loves
it. No wonder she sometimes looks tired. She was watching the large
red poppies come out. Then she walked off the lawn to the meadow, whose
corner to the right can just see. Trail, trail, went her long dress
over the sopping grass, and she came back with her hands full of the hay
that was cut yesterday--suppose for rabbits or something, as she kept
on smelling it. The air here is delicious. Later on heard the noise
of croquet balls, and looked out again, and it was Charles Wilcox
practising; they are keen on all games. Presently he started sneezing
and had to stop. Then hear more clicketing, and it is Mr. Wilcox
practising, and then,  a-tissue, a-tissue : he has to stop too. Then
Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is
tacked on to a green-gage-tree--they put everything to use--and then
she says  a-tissue,  and in she goes. And finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears,
trail, trail, still smelling hay and looking at the flowers. inflict
all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and
sometimes only a drama, and one must learn to distinguish tother from
which, and up to now have always put that down as  Meg s clever
nonsense.  But this morning, it really does seem not life but a play,
and it did amuse me enormously to watch the W s. Now Mrs. Wilcox has
come in.

 am going to wear [omission]. Last night Mrs. Wilcox wore an
[omission], and Evie [omission]. So it isn t exactly a go-as-you-please
place, and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we
expected. Not if you open them. The dog-roses are too sweet. There is a
great hedge of them over the lawn--magnificently tall, so that they fall
down in garlands, and nice and thin at the bottom, so that you can see
ducks through it and a cow. These belong to the farm, which is the only
house near us. There goes the breakfast gong. Much love. Modified love
to Tibby. Love to Aunt Juley; how good of her to come and keep you
company, but what a bore. Burn this. Will write again Thursday.

 Dearest Meg,

 am having a glorious time. like them all. Mrs. Wilcox, if quieter
than in Germany, is sweeter than ever, and never saw anything like her
steady unselfishness, and the best of it is that the others do not take
advantage of her. They are the very happiest, jolliest family that you
can imagine. do really feel that we are making friends. The fun of
it is that they think me a noodle, and say so--at least, Mr. Wilcox
does--and when that happens, and one doesn t mind, it s a pretty sure
test, isn t it? He says the most horrid things about woman s suffrage so
nicely, and when said believed in equality he just folded his arms
and gave me such a setting down as ve never had. Meg, shall we ever
learn to talk less? never felt so ashamed of myself in my life. couldn t point to a time when men had been equal, nor even to a time
when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways. couldn t say a word. had just picked up the notion that equality is
good from some book--probably from poetry, or you. Anyhow, it s been
knocked into pieces, and, like all people who are really strong, Mr.
Wilcox did it without hurting me. On the other hand, laugh at them for
catching hay fever. We live like fighting-cocks, and Charles takes us
out every day in the motor--a tomb with trees in it, a hermit s house,
a wonderful road that was made by the Kings of Mercia--tennis--a cricket
match--bridge and at night we squeeze up in this lovely house. The whole
clan s here now--it s like a rabbit warren. Evie is a dear. They want
me to stop over Sunday--suppose it won t matter if do. Marvellous
weather and the views marvellous--views westward to the high ground.
Thank you for your letter. Burn this.

 Your affectionate

 HELEN.

Margaret glanced at her sister s note and pushed it over the
breakfast-table to her aunt. There was a moment s hush, and then the
flood-gates opened.

 I can tell you nothing, Aunt Juley. I know no more than you do. We
met--we only met the father and mother abroad last spring. I know so
little that I didn t even know their son s name. It s all so--  She
waved her hand and laughed a little.

 In that case it is far too sudden. 

 Who knows, Aunt Juley, who knows? 

 But, Margaret, dear, I mean, we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve
come to facts. It is too sudden, surely. 

 Who knows! 

 But, Margaret, dear-- 

 I ll go for her other letters,  said Margaret.  No, I won t, I ll
finish my breakfast. In fact, I haven t them. We met the Wilcoxes on an
awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer. Helen and I
had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at
Speyer--the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors--you
know-- Speyer, Maintz, and Koln.  Those three sees once commanded the
Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street. 

 I still feel quite uneasy about this business, Margaret. 

 The train crossed by a bridge of boats, and at first sight it looked
quite fine. But oh, in five minutes we had seen the whole thing. The
cathedral had been ruined, absolutely ruined, by restoration; not an
inch left of the original structure. We wasted a whole day, and came
across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public
gardens. They too, poor things, had been taken in--they were actually
stopping at Speyer--and they rather liked Helen s insisting that they
must fly with us to Heidelberg. As a matter of fact, they did come on
next day. We all took some drives together. They knew us well enough to
ask Helen to come and see them--at least, I was asked too, but Tibby s
illness prevented me, so last Monday she went alone. That s all. You
know as much as I do now. It s a young man out of the unknown. She was
to have come back Saturday, but put off till Monday, perhaps on account
of--I don t know. 

She broke off, and listened to the sounds of a London morning. Their
house was in Wickham Place, and fairly quiet, for a lofty promontory of
buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare. One had the sense of
a backwater, or rather of an estuary, whose waters flowed in from the
invisible sea, and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without
were still beating. Though the promontory consisted of flats--expensive,
with cavernous entrance halls, full of concierges and palms--it
fulfilled its purpose, and gained for the older houses opposite a
certain measure of peace.

These, too, would be swept away in time, and another promontory would
arise upon their site, as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the
precious soil of London.

Mrs. Munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces. She decided
that Margaret was a little hysterical, and was trying to gain time by
a torrent of talk. Feeling very diplomatic, she lamented the fate of
Speyer, and declared that never, never should she be so misguided as to
visit it, and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration
were ill understood in Germany.  The Germans,  she said,  are too
thorough, and this is all very well sometimes, but at other times it
does not do. 

 Exactly,  said Margaret;  Germans are too thorough.  And her eyes began
to shine.

 Of course I regard you Schlegels as English,  said Mrs. Munt
hastily-- English to the backbone. 

Margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand.

 And that reminds me--Helen s letter. 

 Oh yes, Aunt Juley, I am thinking all right about Helen s letter. I
know--I must go down and see her. I am thinking about her all right. I
am meaning to go down. 

 But go with some plan,  said Mrs. Munt, admitting into her kindly voice
a note of exasperation.  Margaret, if I may interfere, don t be taken by
surprise. What do you think of the Wilcoxes? Are they our sort? Are they
likely people? Could they appreciate Helen, who is to my mind a very
special sort of person? Do they care about Literature and Art? That is
most important when you come to think of it. Literature and Art. Most
important. How old would the son be? She says  younger son.  Would he
be in a position to marry? Is he likely to make Helen happy? Did you
gather-- 

 I gathered nothing. 

They began to talk at once.

 Then in that case-- 

 In that case I can make no plans, don t you see. 

 On the contrary-- 

 I hate plans. I hate lines of action. Helen isn t a baby. 

 Then in that case, my dear, why go down? 

Margaret was silent. If her aunt could not see why she must go down,
she was not going to tell her. She was not going to say,  I love my dear
sister; I must be near her at this crisis of her life.  The affections
are more reticent than the passions, and their expression more subtle.
If she herself should ever fall in love with a man, she, like Helen,
would proclaim it from the housetops, but as she loved only a sister she
used the voiceless language of sympathy.

 I consider you odd girls,  continued Mrs. Munt,  and very wonderful
girls, and in many ways far older than your years. But--you won t be
offended? frankly, I feel you are not up to this business. It requires
an older person. Dear, I have nothing to call me back to Swanage.  She
spread out her plump arms.  I am all at your disposal. Let me go down to
this house whose name I forget instead of you. 

 Aunt Juley --she jumped up and kissed her-- I must, must go to Howards
End myself. You don t exactly understand, though I can never thank you
properly for offering. 

 I do understand,  retorted Mrs. Munt, with immense confidence.  I go
down in no spirit of interference, but to make inquiries. Inquiries are
necessary. Now, I am going to be rude. You would say the wrong thing; to
a certainty you would. In your anxiety for Helen s happiness you would
offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous
questions--not that one minds offending them. 

 I shall ask no questions. I have it in Helen s writing that she and
a man are in love. There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to
that. All the rest isn t worth a straw. A long engagement if you like,
but inquiries, questions, plans, lines of action--no, Aunt Juley, no. 

Away she hurried, not beautiful, not supremely brilliant, but filled
with something that took the place of both qualities--something best
described as a profound vivacity, a continual and sincere response to
all that she encountered in her path through life.

 If Helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a
penniless clerk-- 

 Dear Margaret, do come into the library and shut the door. Your good
maids are dusting the banisters. 

 --or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter Paterson,
I should have said the same.  Then, with one of those turns that
convinced her aunt that she was not mad really, and convinced observers
of another type that she was not a barren theorist, she added:  Though
in the case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long
engagement indeed, I must say. 

 I should think so,  said Mrs. Munt;  and, indeed, I can scarcely
follow you. Now, just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the
Wilcoxes. I understand it, but most good people would think you mad.
Imagine how disconcerting for Helen! What is wanted is a person who will
go slowly, slowly in this business, and see how things are and where
they are likely to lead to. 

Margaret was down on this.

 But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off. 

 I think probably it must; but slowly. 

 Can you break an engagement off slowly?  Her eyes lit up.  What s an
engagement made of, do you suppose? I think it s made of some hard stuff
that may snap, but can t break. It is different to the other ties of
life. They stretch or bend. They admit of degree. They re different. 

 Exactly so. But won t you let me just run down to Howards House, and
save you all the discomfort? I will really not interfere, but I do so
thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one
quiet look round will be enough for me. 

Margaret again thanked her, again kissed her, and then ran upstairs to
see her brother.

He was not so well.

The hay fever had worried him a good deal all night. His head ached,
his eyes were wet, his mucous membrane, he informed her, in a most
unsatisfactory condition. The only thing that made life worth living was
the thought of Walter Savage Landor, from whose Imaginary Conversations
she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day.

It was rather difficult. Something must be done about Helen. She must
be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight.
A telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit
seemed each moment more impossible. Now the doctor arrived, and said
that Tibby was quite bad. Might it really be best to accept Aunt Juley s
kind offer, and to send her down to Howards End with a note?

Certainly Margaret was impulsive. She did swing rapidly from one
decision to another. Running downstairs into the library, she cried:
 Yes, I have changed my mind; I do wish that you would go. 

There was a train from King s Cross at eleven. At half-past ten Tibby,
with rare self-effacement, fell asleep, and Margaret was able to drive
her aunt to the station.

 You will remember, Aunt Juley, not to be drawn into discussing the
engagement. Give my letter to Helen, and say whatever you feel yourself,
but do keep clear of the relatives. We have scarcely got their names
straight yet, and, besides, that sort of thing is so uncivilised and
wrong. 

 So uncivilised?  queried Mrs. Munt, fearing that she was losing the
point of some brilliant remark.

 Oh, I used an affected word. I only meant would you please talk the
thing over only with Helen. 

 Only with Helen. 

 Because--  But it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love.
Even Margaret shrank from it, and contented herself with stroking
her good aunt s hand, and with meditating, half sensibly and half
poetically, on the journey that was about to begin from King s Cross.

Like many others who have lived long in a great capital, she had strong
feelings about the various railway termini. They are our gates to the
glorious and the unknown. Through them we pass out into adventure and
sunshine, to them, alas! we return. In Paddington all Cornwall is latent
and the remoter west; down the inclines of Liverpool Street lie fenlands
and the illimitable Broads; Scotland is through the pylons of Euston;
Wessex behind the poised chaos of Waterloo. Italians realise this, as is
natural; those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in
Berlin call the Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d Italia, because by it they
must return to their homes. And he is a chilly Londoner who does not
endow his stations with some personality, and extend to them, however
shyly, the emotions of fear and love.

To Margaret--I hope that it will not set the reader against her--the
station of King s Cross had always suggested Infinity. Its very
situation--withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St.
Pancras--implied a comment on the materialism of life. Those two great
arches, colourless, indifferent, shouldering between them an unlovely
clock, were fit portals for some eternal adventure, whose issue might
be prosperous, but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary
language of prosperity. If you think this ridiculous, remember that it
is not Margaret who is telling you about it; and let me hasten to add
that they were in plenty of time for the train; that Mrs. Munt, though
she took a second-class ticket, was put by the guard into a first (only
two  seconds  on the train, one smoking and the other babies--one cannot
be expected to travel with babies); and that Margaret, on her return to
Wickham Place, was confronted with the following telegram:

 All over. Wish I had never written. Tell no one--, HELEN. 

But Aunt Juley was gone--gone irrevocably, and no power on earth could
stop her.

but  margaret  dear      i ll go for her other letters   said margaret   no  i won t  i ll finish my breakfast  in fact  i haven t them  we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer  helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer  the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors  you know   speyer  maintz  and koln   those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street     i still feel quite uneasy about this business  margaret     the train crossed by a bridge of boats  and at first sight it looked quite fine  but oh  in five minutes we had seen the whole thing  the cathedral had been ruined  absolutely ruined  by restoration  not an inch left of the original structure  we wasted a whole day  and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens  they too  poor things  had been taken in  they were actually stopping at speyer  and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg  as a matter of fact  they did come on next day  we all took some drives together  they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them  at least  i was asked too  but tibby s illness prevented me  so last monday she went alone  that s all  you know as much as i do now  it s a young man out of the unknown  she was to have come back saturday  but put off till monday  perhaps on account of  i don t know    she broke off  and listened to the sounds of a london morning  their house was in wickham place  and fairly quiet  for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare  one had the sense of a backwater  or rather of an estuary  whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea  and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating  though the promontory consisted of flats  expensive  with cavernous entrance halls  full of concierges and palms  it fulfilled its purpose  and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace   these  too  would be swept away in time  and another promontory would arise upon their site  as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of london   mrs  munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces  she decided that margaret was a little hysterical  and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk  feeling very diplomatic  she lamented the fate of speyer  and declared that never  never should she be so misguided as to visit it  and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in germany   the germans   she said   are too thorough  and this is all very well sometimes  but at other times it does not do     exactly   said margaret   germans are too thorough   and her eyes began to shine    of course i regard you schlegels as english   said mrs  munt hastily   english to the backbone    margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand    and that reminds me  helen s letter     oh yes  aunt juley  i am thinking all right about helen s letter  i know  i must go down and see her  i am thinking about her all right  i am meaning to go down     but go with some plan   said mrs  munt  admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation   margaret  if i may interfere  don t be taken by surprise  what do you think of the wilcoxes  are they our sort  are they likely people  could they appreciate helen  who is to my mind a very special sort of person  do they care about literature and art  that is most important when you come to think of it  literature and art  most important  how old would the son be  she says  younger son   would he be in a position to marry  is he likely to make helen happy  did you gather      i gathered nothing    they began to talk at once    then in that case      in that case i can make no plans  don t you see     on the contrary      i hate plans  i hate lines of action  helen isn t a baby     then in that case  my dear  why go down    margaret was silent  if her aunt could not see why she must go down  she was not going to tell her  she was not going to say   i love my dear sister  i must be near her at this crisis of her life   the affections are more reticent than the passions  and their expression more subtle  if she herself should ever fall in love with a man  she  like helen  would proclaim it from the housetops  but as she loved only a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy    i consider you odd girls   continued mrs  munt   and very wonderful girls  and in many ways far older than your years  but  you won t be offended  frankly  i feel you are not up to this business  it requires an older person  dear  i have nothing to call me back to swanage   she spread out her plump arms   i am all at your disposal  let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you     aunt juley   she jumped up and kissed her   i must  must go to howards end myself  you don t exactly understand  though i can never thank you properly for offering     i do understand   retorted mrs  munt  with immense confidence   i go down in no spirit of interference  but to make inquiries  inquiries are necessary  now  i am going to be rude  you would say the wrong thing  to a certainty you would  in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions  not that one minds offending them     i shall ask no questions  i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love  there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that  all the rest isn t worth a straw  a long engagement if you like  but inquiries  questions  plans  lines of action  no  aunt juley  no    away she hurried  not beautiful  not supremely brilliant  but filled with something that took the place of both qualities  something best described as a profound vivacity  a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her path through life    if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk      dear margaret  do come into the library and shut the door  your good maids are dusting the banisters       or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson  i should have said the same   then  with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not mad really  and convinced observers of another type that she was not a barren theorist  she added   though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed  i must say     i should think so   said mrs  munt   and  indeed  i can scarcely follow you  now  just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes  i understand it  but most good people would think you mad  imagine how disconcerting for helen  what is wanted is a person who will go slowly  slowly in this business  and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to    margaret was down on this    but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off     i think probably it must  but slowly     can you break an engagement off slowly   her eyes lit up   what s an engagement made of  do you suppose  i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap  but can t break  it is different to the other ties of life  they stretch or bend  they admit of degree  they re different     exactly so  but won t you let me just run down to howards house  and save you all the discomfort  i will really not interfere  but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me    margaret again thanked her  again kissed her  and then ran upstairs to see her brother   he was not so well   the hay fever had worried him a good deal all night  his head ached  his eyes were wet  his mucous membrane  he informed her  in a most unsatisfactory condition  the only thing that made life worth living was the thought of walter savage landor  from whose imaginary conversations she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day   it was rather difficult  something must be done about helen  she must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight  a telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic  a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible  now the doctor arrived  and said that tibby was quite bad  might it really be best to accept aunt juley s kind offer  and to send her down to howards end with a note   certainly margaret was impulsive  she did swing rapidly from one decision to another  running downstairs into the library  she cried   yes  i have changed my mind  i do wish that you would go    there was a train from king s cross at eleven  at half past ten tibby  with rare self effacement  fell asleep  and margaret was able to drive her aunt to the station    you will remember  aunt juley  not to be drawn into discussing the engagement  give my letter to helen  and say whatever you feel yourself  but do keep clear of the relatives  we have scarcely got their names straight yet  and  besides  that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong     so uncivilised   queried mrs  munt  fearing that she was losing the point of some brilliant remark    oh  i used an affected word  i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen     only with helen     because    but it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love  even margaret shrank from it  and contented herself with stroking her good aunt s hand  and with meditating  half sensibly and half poetically  on the journey that was about to begin from king s cross   like many others who have lived long in a great capital  she had strong feelings about the various railway termini  they are our gates to the glorious and the unknown  through them we pass out into adventure and sunshine  to them  alas  we return  in paddington all cornwall is latent and the remoter west  down the inclines of liverpool street lie fenlands and the illimitable broads  scotland is through the pylons of euston  wessex behind the poised chaos of waterloo  italians realise this  as is natural  those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in berlin call the anhalt bahnhof the stazione d italia  because by it they must return to their homes  and he is a chilly londoner who does not endow his stations with some personality  and extend to them  however shyly  the emotions of fear and love   to margaret  i hope that it will not set the reader against her  the station of king s cross had always suggested infinity  its very situation  withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of st  pancras  implied a comment on the materialism of life  those two great arches  colourless  indifferent  shouldering between them an unlovely clock  were fit portals for some eternal adventure  whose issue might be prosperous  but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity  if you think this ridiculous  remember that it is not margaret who is telling you about it  and let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for the train  that mrs  munt  though she took a second class ticket  was put by the guard into a first  only two  seconds  on the train  one smoking and the other babies  one cannot be expected to travel with babies   and that margaret  on her return to wickham place  was confronted with the following telegram    all over  wish i had never written  tell no one    helen    but aunt juley was gone  gone irrevocably  and no power on earth could stop

2,2,247,373,499,"

Most complacently did Mrs. Munt rehearse her mission. Her nieces were
independent young women, and it was not often that she was able to help
them. Emily s daughters had never been quite like other girls. They
had been left motherless when Tibby was born, when Helen was five and
Margaret herself but thirteen. It was before the passing of the Deceased
Wife s Sister Bill, so Mrs. Munt could without impropriety offer to
go and keep house at Wickham Place. But her brother-in-law, who was
peculiar and a German, had referred the question to Margaret, who with
the crudity of youth had answered,  No, they could manage much better
alone.  Five years later Mr. Schlegel had died too, and Mrs. Munt had
repeated her offer. Margaret, crude no longer, had been grateful and
extremely nice, but the substance of her answer had been the same.  I
must not interfere a third time,  thought Mrs. Munt. However, of course
she did. She learnt, to her horror, that Margaret, now of age, was
taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into
Foreign Things, which always smash. Silence would have been criminal.
Her own fortune was invested in Home Rails, and most ardently did
she beg her niece to imitate her.  Then we should be together, dear. 
 Margaret, out of politeness, invested a few hundreds in the Nottingham
and Derby Railway, and though the Foreign Things did admirably and the
Nottingham and Derby declined with the steady dignity of which only Home
Rails are capable, Mrs. Munt never ceased to rejoice, and to say,  I did
manage that, at all events. When the smash comes poor Margaret will have
a nest-egg to fall back upon.  This year Helen came of age, and exactly
the same thing happened in Helen s case; she also would shift her money
out of Consols, but she, too, almost without being pressed, consecrated
a fraction of it to the Nottingham and Derby Railway. So far so good,
but in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing. Sooner or
later the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves
away, and if they had delayed hitherto, it was only that they might
throw themselves more vehemently in the future. They saw too many people
at Wickham Place--unshaven musicians, an actress even, German cousins
(one knows what foreigners are), acquaintances picked up at Continental
hotels (one knows what they are too). It was interesting, and down
at Swanage no one appreciated culture more than Mrs. Munt; but it was
dangerous, and disaster was bound to come. How right she was, and how
lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came!

The train sped northward, under innumerable tunnels. It was only an
hour s journey, but Mrs. Munt had to raise and lower the window again
and again. She passed through the South Welwyn Tunnel, saw light for
a moment, and entered the North Welwyn Tunnel, of tragic fame. She
traversed the immense viaduct, whose arches span untroubled meadows and
the dreamy flow of Tewin Water. She skirted the parks of politicians. At
times the Great North Road accompanied her, more suggestive of infinity
than any railway, awakening, after a nap of a hundred years, to such
life as is conferred by the stench of motor-cars, and to such culture
as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills. To history,
to tragedy, to the past, to the future, Mrs. Munt remained equally
indifferent; hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey, and to
rescue poor Helen from this dreadful mess.

The station for Howards End was at Hilton, one of the large villages
that are strung so frequently along the North Road, and that owe their
size to the traffic of coaching and pre-coaching days. Being near
London, it had not shared in the rural decay, and its long High Street
had budded out right and left into residential estates. For about a
mile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before Mrs. Munt s
inattentive eyes, a series broken at one point by six Danish tumuli that
stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad, tombs of soldiers. Beyond
these tumuli, habitations thickened, and the train came to a standstill
in a tangle that was almost a town.

The station, like the scenery, like Helen s letters, struck an
indeterminate note. Into which country will it lead, England or
Suburbia? It was new, it had island platforms and a subway, and the
superficial comfort exacted by business men. But it held hints of local
life, personal intercourse, as even Mrs. Munt was to discover.

 I want a house,  she confided to the ticket boy.  Its name is Howards
Lodge. Do you know where it is? 

 Mr. Wilcox!  the boy called.

A young man in front of them turned around.

 She s wanting Howards End. 

There was nothing for it but to go forward, though Mrs. Munt was too
much agitated even to stare at the stranger. But remembering that there
were two brothers, she had the sense to say to him,  Excuse me asking,
but are you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder? 

 The younger. Can I do anything for you? 

 Oh, well --she controlled herself with difficulty.  Really. Are you?
I--  She moved; away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice.  I am
Miss Schlegel s aunt. I ought to introduce myself, oughtn t I? My name
is Mrs. Munt. 

She was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly,  Oh,
rather; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us. Did you want to see her? 

 Possibly. 

 I ll call you a cab. No; wait a mo--  He thought.  Our motor s here.
I ll run you up in it. 

 That is very kind. 

 Not at all, if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the
office. This way. 

 My niece is not with you by any chance? 

 No; I came over with my father. He has gone on north in your train.
You ll see Miss Schlegel at lunch. You re coming up to lunch, I hope? 

 I should like to come UP,  said Mrs. Munt, not committing herself to
nourishment until she had studied Helen s lover a little more. He seemed
a gentleman, but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation
were numbed. She glanced at him stealthily.

To a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at
the corners of his mouth, or in the rather box-like construction of his
forehead. He was dark, clean-shaven, and seemed accustomed to command.

 In front or behind? Which do you prefer? It may be windy in front. 

 In front if I may; then we can talk. 

 But excuse me one moment--I can t think what they re doing with that
parcel.  He strode into the booking-office, and called with a new voice:
 Hi! hi, you there! Are you going to keep me waiting all day? Parcel for
Wilcox, Howards End. Just look sharp! 

Emerging, he said in quieter tones:  This station s abominably
organised; if I had my way, the whole lot of  em should get the sack.
May I help you in? 

 This is very good of you,  said Mrs. Munt, as she settled herself into
a luxurious cavern of red leather, and suffered her person to be padded
with rugs and shawls. She was more civil than she had intended, but
really this young man was very kind. Moreover, she was a little afraid
of him; his self-possession was extraordinary.  Very good indeed,  she
repeated, adding:  It is just what I should have wished. 

 Very good of you to say so,  he replied, with a slight look of
surprise, which, like most slight looks, escaped Mrs. Munt s attention.
 I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train. 

 You see, we heard from Helen this morning. 

Young Wilcox was pouring in petrol, starting his engine, and performing
other actions with which this story has no concern. The great car began
to rock, and the form of Mrs. Munt, trying to explain things, sprang
agreeably up and down among the red cushions.  The mater will be very
glad to see you,  he mumbled.  Hi! I say. Parcel. Parcel for Howards
End. Bring it out. Hi! 

A bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book
in the other. With the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations
mingled:  Sign, must I? Why the -- should I sign after all this bother?
Not even got a pencil on you? Remember next time I report you to the
station-master. My time s of value, though yours mayn t be. Here --here
being a tip.

 Extremely sorry, Mrs. Munt. 

 Not at all, Mr. Wilcox. 

 And do you object to going through the village? It is rather a longer
spin, but I have one or two commissions. 

 I should love going through the village. Naturally I am very anxious to
talk things over with you. 

As she said this she felt ashamed, for she was disobeying Margaret s
instructions. Only disobeying them in the letter, surely. Margaret had
only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders. Surely
it was not  uncivilised or wrong  to discuss it with the young man
himself, since chance had thrown them together.

A reticent fellow, he made no reply. Mounting by her side, he put on
gloves and spectacles, and off they drove, the bearded porter--life is a
mysterious business--looking after them with admiration.

The wind was in their faces down the station road, blowing the dust into
Mrs. Munt s eyes. But as soon as they turned into the Great North Road
she opened fire.  You can well imagine,  she said,  that the news was a
great shock to us. 

 What news? 

 Mr. Wilcox,  she said frankly,  Margaret has told me
everything--everything. I have seen Helen s letter. 

He could not look her in the face, as his eyes were fixed on his work;
he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the High Street. But he
inclined his head in her direction, and said:  I beg your pardon; I
didn t catch. 

 About Helen. Helen, of course. Helen is a very exceptional person--I
am sure you will let me say this, feeling towards her as you do--indeed,
all the Schlegels are exceptional. I come in no spirit of interference,
but it was a great shock. 

They drew up opposite a draper s. Without replying, he turned round in
his seat, and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in
their passage through the village. It was settling again, but not all
into the road from which he had taken it. Some of it had percolated
through the open windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries
of the wayside gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the
lungs of the villagers.  I wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the
roads,  was his comment. Then a man ran out of the draper s with a roll
of oilcloth, and off they went again.

 Margaret could not come herself, on account of poor Tibby, so I am here
to represent her and to have a good talk. 

 I m sorry to be so dense,  said the young man, again drawing up outside
a shop.  But I still haven t quite understood. 

 Helen, Mr. Wilcox--my niece and you. 

He pushed up his goggles and gazed at her, absolutely bewildered. Horror
smote her to the heart, for even she began to suspect that they were at
cross-purposes, and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous
blunder.

 Miss Schlegel and myself?  he asked, compressing his lips.

 I trust there has been no misunderstanding,  quavered Mrs. Munt.  Her
letter certainly read that way. 

 What way? 

 That you and she--  She paused, then drooped her eyelids.

 I think I catch your meaning,  he said stickily.  What an extraordinary
mistake! 

 Then you didn t the least--  she stammered, getting blood-red in the
face, and wishing she had never been born.

 Scarcely, as I am already engaged to another lady.  There was a
moment s silence, and then he caught his breath and exploded with,  Oh,
good God! Don t tell me it s some silliness of Paul s. 

 But you are Paul. 

 I m not. 

 Then why did you say so at the station? 

 I said nothing of the sort. 

 I beg your pardon, you did. 

 I beg your pardon, I did not. My name is Charles. 

 Younger  may mean son as opposed to father, or second brother as
opposed to first. There is much to be said for either view, and later on
they said it. But they had other questions before them now.

 Do you mean to tell me that Paul-- 

But she did not like his voice. He sounded as if he was talking to a
porter, and, certain that he had deceived her at the station, she too
grew angry.

 Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece-- 

Mrs. Munt--such is human nature--determined that she would champion the
lovers. She was not going to be bullied by a severe young man.  Yes,
they care for one another very much indeed,  she said.  I dare say they
will tell you about it by-and-by. We heard this morning. 

And Charles clenched his fist and cried,  The idiot, the idiot, the
little fool! 

Mrs. Munt tried to divest herself of her rugs.  If that is your
attitude, Mr. Wilcox, I prefer to walk. 

 I beg you will do no such thing. I take you up this moment to the
house. Let me tell you the thing s impossible, and must be stopped. 

Mrs. Munt did not often lose her temper, and when she did it was only to
protect those whom she loved. On this occasion she blazed out.  I quite
agree, sir. The thing is impossible, and I will come up and stop it. My
niece is a very exceptional person, and I am not inclined to sit still
while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her. 

Charles worked his jaws.

 Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday, and only
met your father and mother at a stray hotel-- 

 Could you possibly lower your voice? The shopman will overhear. 

Esprit de classe--if one may coin the phrase--was strong in Mrs. Munt.
She sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal
funnel, a saucepan, and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth.

 Right behind? 

 Yes, sir.  And the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust.

 I warn you: Paul hasn t a penny; it s useless. 

 No need to warn us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you. The warning is all the
other way. My niece has been very foolish, and I shall give her a good
scolding and take her back to London with me. 

 He has to make his way out in Nigeria. He couldn t think of marrying
for years, and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the
climate, and is in other ways--Why hasn t he told us? Of course he s
ashamed. He knows he s been a fool. And so he has--a downright fool. 

She grew furious.

 Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news. 

 If I were a man, Mr. Wilcox, for that last remark I d box your ears.
You re not fit to clean my niece s boots, to sit in the same room with
her, and you dare--you actually dare--I decline to argue with such a
person. 

 All I know is, she s spread the thing and he hasn t, and my father s
away and I-- 

 And all that I know is-- 

 Might I finish my sentence, please? 

 No. 

Charles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the
lane.

She screamed.

So they played the game of Capping Families, a round of which is always
played when love would unite two members of our race. But they played it
with unusual vigour, stating in so many words that Schlegels were better
than Wilcoxes, Wilcoxes better than Schlegels. They flung decency
aside. The man was young, the woman deeply stirred; in both a vein of
coarseness was latent. Their quarrel was no more surprising than are
most quarrels--inevitable at the time, incredible afterwards. But it was
more than usually futile. A few minutes, and they were enlightened. The
motor drew up at Howards End, and Helen, looking very pale, ran out to
meet her aunt.

 Aunt Juley, I have just had a telegram from Margaret; I--I meant to
stop your coming. It isn t--it s over. 

The climax was too much for Mrs. Munt. She burst into tears.

 Aunt Juley dear, don t. Don t let them know I ve been so silly. It
wasn t anything. Do bear up for my sake. 

 Paul,  cried Charles Wilcox, pulling his gloves off.

 Don t let them know. They are never to know. 

 Oh, my darling Helen-- 

 Paul! Paul! 

A very young man came out of the house.

 Paul, is there any truth in this? 

 I didn t--I don t-- 

 Yes or no, man; plain question, plain answer. Did or didn t Miss
Schlegel-- 

 Charles, dear,  said a voice from the garden.  Charles, dear Charles,
one doesn t ask plain questions. There aren t such things. 

They were all silent. It was Mrs. Wilcox.

She approached just as Helen s letter had described her, trailing
noiselessly over the lawn, and there was actually a wisp of hay in her
hands. She seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor, but
to the house, and to the tree that overshadowed it. One knew that she
worshipped the past, and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone
bestow had descended upon her--that wisdom to which we give the clumsy
name of aristocracy. High born she might not be. But assuredly she cared
about her ancestors, and let them help her. When she saw Charles angry,
Paul frightened, and Mrs. Munt in tears, she heard her ancestors say,
 Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most. The rest
can wait.  So she did not ask questions. Still less did she pretend that
nothing had happened, as a competent society hostess would have done.
She said:  Miss Schlegel, would you take your aunt up to your room or
to my room, whichever you think best. Paul, do find Evie, and tell her
lunch for six, but I m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for
it.  And when they had obeyed her, she turned to her elder son, who
still stood in the throbbing, stinking car, and smiled at him with
tenderness, and without saying a word, turned away from him towards her
flowers.

 Mother,  he called,  are you aware that Paul has been playing the fool
again? 

 It is all right, dear. They have broken off the engagement. 

 Engagement--! 

 They do not love any longer, if you prefer it put that way,  said Mrs.
Wilcox, stooping down to smell a rose.

",most complacently did mrs  munt rehearse her mission  her nieces were independent young women  and it was not often that she was able to help them  emily s daughters had never been quite like other girls  they had been left motherless when tibby was born  when helen was five and margaret herself but thirteen  it was before the passing of the deceased wife s sister bill  so mrs  munt could without impropriety offer to go and keep house at wickham place  but her brother in law  who was peculiar and a german  had referred the question to margaret  who with the crudity of youth had answered   no  they could manage much better alone   five years later mr  schlegel had died too  and mrs  munt had repeated her offer  margaret  crude no longer  had been grateful and extremely nice  but the substance of her answer had been the same   i must not interfere a third time   thought mrs  munt  however  of course she did  she learnt  to her horror  that margaret  now of age  was taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into foreign things  which always smash  silence would have been criminal  her own fortune was invested in home rails  and most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her   then we should be together  dear    margaret  out of politeness  invested a few hundreds in the nottingham and derby railway  and though the foreign things did admirably and the nottingham and derby declined with the steady dignity of which only home rails are capable  mrs  munt never ceased to rejoice  and to say   i did manage that  at all events  when the smash comes poor margaret will have a nest egg to fall back upon   this year helen came of age  and exactly the same thing happened in helen s case  she also would shift her money out of consols  but she  too  almost without being pressed  consecrated a fraction of it to the nottingham and derby railway  so far so good  but in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing  sooner or later the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves away  and if they had delayed hitherto  it was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently in the future  they saw too many people at wickham place  unshaven musicians  an actress even  german cousins  one knows what foreigners are   acquaintances picked up at continental hotels  one knows what they are too   it was interesting  and down at swanage no one appreciated culture more than mrs  munt  but it was dangerous  and disaster was bound to come  how right she was  and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came   the train sped northward  under innumerable tunnels  it was only an hour s journey  but mrs  munt had to raise and lower the window again and again  she passed through the south welwyn tunnel  saw light for a moment  and entered the north welwyn tunnel  of tragic fame  she traversed the immense viaduct  whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of tewin water  she skirted the parks of politicians  at times the great north road accompanied her  more suggestive of infinity than any railway  awakening  after a nap of a hundred years  to such life as is conferred by the stench of motor cars  and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills  to history  to tragedy  to the past  to the future  mrs  munt remained equally indifferent  hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey  and to rescue poor helen from this dreadful mess   the station for howards end was at hilton  one of the large villages that are strung so frequently along the north road  and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and pre coaching days  being near london  it had not shared in the rural decay  and its long high street had budded out right and left into residential estates  for about a mile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before mrs  munt s inattentive eyes  a series broken at one point by six danish tumuli that stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad  tombs of soldiers  beyond these tumuli  habitations thickened  and the train came to a standstill in a tangle that was almost a town   the station  like the scenery  like helen s letters  struck an indeterminate note  into which country will it lead  england or suburbia  it was new  it had island platforms and a subway  and the superficial comfort exacted by business men  but it held hints of local life  personal intercourse  as even mrs  munt was to discover    i want a house   she confided to the ticket boy   its name is howards lodge  do you know where it is     mr  wilcox   the boy called   a young man in front of them turned around    she s wanting howards end    there was nothing for it but to go forward  though mrs  munt was too much agitated even to stare at the stranger  but remembering that there were two brothers  she had the sense to say to him   excuse me asking  but are you the younger mr  wilcox or the elder     the younger  can i do anything for you     oh  well   she controlled herself with difficulty   really  are you  i    she moved  away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice   i am miss schlegel s aunt  i ought to introduce myself  oughtn t i  my name is mrs  munt    she was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly   oh  rather  miss schlegel is stopping with us  did you want to see her     possibly     i ll call you a cab  no  wait a mo    he thought   our motor s here  i ll run you up in it     that is very kind     not at all  if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office  this way     my niece is not with you by any chance     no  i came over with my father  he has gone on north in your train  you ll see miss schlegel at lunch  you re coming up to lunch  i hope     i should like to come up   said mrs  munt  not committing herself to nourishment until she had studied helen s lover a little more  he seemed a gentleman  but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation were numbed  she glanced at him stealthily   to a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the corners of his mouth  or in the rather box like construction of his forehead  he was dark  clean shaven  and seemed accustomed to command    in front or behind  which do you prefer  it may be windy in front     in front if i may  then we can talk     but excuse me one moment  i can t think what they re doing with that parcel   he strode into the booking office  and called with a new voice   hi  hi  you there  are you going to keep me waiting all day  parcel for wilcox  howards end  just look sharp    emerging  he said in quieter tones   this station s abominably organised  if i had my way  the whole lot of  them should get the sack  may i help you in     this is very good of you   said mrs  munt  as she settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather  and suffered her person to be padded with rugs and shawls  she was more civil than she had intended  but really this young man was very kind  moreover  she was a little afraid of him  his self possession was extraordinary   very good indeed   she repeated  adding   it is just what i should have wished     very good of you to say so   he replied  with a slight look of surprise  which  like most slight looks  escaped mrs  munt s attention   i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train     you see  we heard from helen this morning    young wilcox was pouring in petrol  starting his engine  and performing other actions with which this story has no concern  the great car began to rock  and the form of mrs  munt  trying to explain things  sprang agreeably up and down among the red cushions   the mater will be very glad to see you   he mumbled   hi  i say  parcel  parcel for howards end  bring it out  hi    a bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book in the other  with the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations mingled   sign  must i  why the    should i sign after all this bother  not even got a pencil on you  remember next time i report you to the station master  my time s of value  though yours mayn t be  here   here being a tip    extremely sorry  mrs  munt     not at all  mr  wilcox     and do you object to going through the village  it is rather a longer spin  but i have one or two commissions     i should love going through the village  naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you    as she said this she felt ashamed  for she was disobeying margaret s instructions  only disobeying them in the letter  surely  margaret had only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders  surely it was not  uncivilised or wrong  to discuss it with the young man himself  since chance had thrown them together   a reticent fellow  he made no reply  mounting by her side  he put on gloves and spectacles  and off they drove  the bearded porter  life is a mysterious business  looking after them with admiration   the wind was in their faces down the station road  blowing the dust into mrs  munt s eyes  but as soon as they turned into the great north road she opened fire   you can well imagine   she said   that the news was a great shock to us     what news     mr  wilcox   she said frankly   margaret has told me everything  everything  i have seen helen s letter    he could not look her in the face  as his eyes were fixed on his work  he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the high street  but he inclined his head in her direction  and said   i beg your pardon  i didn t catch     about helen  helen  of course  helen is a very exceptional person  i am sure you will let me say this  feeling towards her as you do  indeed  all the schlegels are exceptional  i come in no spirit of interference  but it was a great shock    they drew up opposite a draper s  without replying  he turned round in his seat  and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in their passage through the village  it was settling again  but not all into the road from which he had taken it  some of it had percolated through the open windows  some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the wayside gardens  while a certain proportion had entered the lungs of the villagers   i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads   was his comment  then a man ran out of the draper s with a roll of oilcloth  and off they went again    margaret could not come herself  on account of poor tibby  so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk     i m sorry to be so dense   said the young man  again drawing up outside a shop   but i still haven t quite understood     helen  mr  wilcox  my niece and you    he pushed up his goggles and gazed at her  absolutely bewildered  horror smote her to the heart  for even she began to suspect that they were at cross purposes  and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder    miss schlegel and myself   he asked  compressing his lips    i trust there has been no misunderstanding   quavered mrs  munt   her letter certainly read that way     what way     that you and she    she paused  then drooped her eyelids    i think i catch your meaning   he said stickily   what an extraordinary mistake     then you didn t the least    she stammered  getting blood red in the face  and wishing she had never been born    scarcely  as i am already engaged to another lady   there was a moment s silence  and then he caught his breath and exploded with   oh  good god  don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s     but you are paul     i m not     then why did you say so at the station     i said nothing of the sort     i beg your pardon  you did     i beg your pardon  i did not  my name is charles     younger  may mean son as opposed to father  or second brother as opposed to first  there is much to be said for either view  and later on they said it  but they had other questions before them now    do you mean to tell me that paul     but she did not like his voice  he sounded as if he was talking to a porter  and  certain that he had deceived her at the station  she too grew angry    do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece     mrs  munt  such is human nature  determined that she would champion the lovers  she was not going to be bullied by a severe young man   yes  they care for one another very much indeed   she said   i dare say they will tell you about it by and by  we heard this morning    and charles clenched his fist and cried   the idiot  the idiot  the little fool    mrs  munt tried to divest herself of her rugs   if that is your attitude  mr  wilcox  i prefer to walk     i beg you will do no such thing  i take you up this moment to the house  let me tell you the thing s impossible  and must be stopped    mrs  munt did not often lose her temper  and when she did it was only to protect those whom she loved  on this occasion she blazed out   i quite agree  sir  the thing is impossible  and i will come up and stop it  my niece is a very exceptional person  and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her    charles worked his jaws    considering she has only known your brother since wednesday  and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel      could you possibly lower your voice  the shopman will overhear    esprit de classe  if one may coin the phrase  was strong in mrs  munt  she sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal funnel  a saucepan  and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth    right behind     yes  sir   and the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust    i warn you  paul hasn t a penny  it s useless     no need to warn us  mr  wilcox  i assure you  the warning is all the other way  my niece has been very foolish  and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me     he has to make his way out in nigeria  he couldn t think of marrying for years  and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate  and is in other ways  why hasn t he told us  of course he s ashamed  he knows he s been a fool  and so he has  a downright fool    she grew furious    whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news     if i were a man  mr  wilcox  for that last remark i d box your ears  you re not fit to clean my niece s boots  to sit in the same room with her  and you dare  you actually dare  i decline to argue with such a person     all i know is  she s spread the thing and he hasn t  and my father s away and i      and all that i know is      might i finish my sentence  please     no    charles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the lane   she screamed   so they played the game of capping families  a round of which is always played when love would unite two members of our race  but they played it with unusual vigour  stating in so many words that schlegels were better than wilcoxes  wilcoxes better than schlegels  they flung decency aside  the man was young  the woman deeply stirred  in both a vein of coarseness was latent  their quarrel was no more surprising than are

3,3,500,576,653,"Helen and her aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of collapse, and
for a little time Margaret had three invalids on her hands. Mrs. Munt
soon recovered. She possessed to a remarkable degree the power of
distorting the past, and before many days were over she had forgotten
the part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe. Even at the
crisis she had cried,  Thank goodness, poor Margaret is saved this! 
 which during the journey to London evolved into,  It had to be gone
through by some one,  which in its turn ripened into the permanent form
of  The one time really did help Emily s girls was over the Wilcox
business.  But Helen was a more serious patient. New ideas had burst
upon her like a thunderclap, and by them and by their reverberations she
had been stunned.

The truth was that she had fallen in love, not with an individual, but
with a family.

Before Paul arrived she had, as it were, been tuned up into his key.
The energy of the Wilcoxes had fascinated her, had created new images of
beauty in her responsive mind. To be all day with them in the open air,
to sleep at night under their roof, had seemed the supreme joy of
life, and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible
prelude to love. She had liked giving in to Mr. Wilcox, or Evie,
or Charles; she had liked being told that her notions of life were
sheltered or academic; that Equality was nonsense, Votes for Women
nonsense, Socialism nonsense, Art and Literature, except when conducive
to strengthening the character, nonsense. One by one the Schlegel
fetiches had been overthrown, and, though professing to defend them, she
had rejoiced. When Mr. Wilcox said that one sound man of business did
more good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers, she had
swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp, and had leant back
luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar. When Charles said,  Why
be so polite to servants? they don t understand it,  she had not given
the Schlegel retort of,  If they don t understand it, do.  No; she
had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future.  am swathed in
cant,  she thought,  and it is good for me to be stripped of it.  And
all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for
Paul. Paul was inevitable. Charles was taken up with another girl, Mr.
Wilcox was so old, Evie so young, Mrs. Wilcox so different. Round the
absent brother she began to throw the halo of Romance, to irradiate
him with all the splendour of those happy days, to feel that in him she
should draw nearest to the robust ideal. He and she were about the same
age, Evie said. Most people thought Paul handsomer than his brother. He
was certainly a better shot, though not so good at golf. And when Paul
appeared, flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination,
and ready to flirt with any pretty girl, Helen met him halfway, or more
than halfway, and turned towards him on the Sunday evening.

He had been talking of his approaching exile in Nigeria, and he should
have continued to talk of it, and allowed their guest to recover. But
the heave of her bosom flattered him. Passion was possible, and he
became passionate. Deep down in him something whispered,  This girl
would let you kiss her; you might not have such a chance again. 

That was  how it happened,  or, rather, how Helen described it to her
sister, using words even more unsympathetic than my own. But the poetry
of that kiss, the wonder of it, the magic that there was in life for
hours after it--who can describe that? It is so easy for an Englishman
to sneer at these chance collisions of human beings. To the insular
cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity. It is so
easy to talk of  passing emotion,  and to forget how vivid the emotion
was ere it passed. Our impulse to sneer, to forget, is at root a good
one. We recognise that emotion is not enough, and that men and women are
personalities capable of sustained relations, not mere opportunities for
an electrical discharge. Yet we rate the impulse too highly. We do not
admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be
shaken open. To Helen, at all events, her life was to bring nothing more
intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it. He had
drawn her out of the house, where there was danger of surprise and
light; he had led her by a path he knew, until they stood under the
column of the vast wych-elm. A man in the darkness, he had whispered  love you  when she was desiring love. In time his slender personality
faded, the scene that he had evoked endured. In all the variable years
that followed she never saw the like of it again.

 understand,  said Margaret--  at least, understand as much as ever
is understood of these things. Tell me now what happened on the Monday
morning. 

 It was over at once. 

 How, Helen? 

 was still happy while dressed, but as came downstairs got
nervous, and when went into the dining-room knew it was no good.
There was Evie--can t explain--managing the tea-urn, and Mr. Wilcox
reading the Times. 

 Was Paul there? 

 Yes; and Charles was talking to him about stocks and shares, and he
looked frightened. 

By slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other.
Margaret saw horror latent in the scene, and Helen s next remark did not
surprise her.

 Somehow, when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful. It is
all right for us to be frightened, or for men of another sort--father,
for instance; but for men like that! When saw all the others so
placid, and Paul mad with terror in case said the wrong thing, felt
for a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud, just a wall of
newspapers and motor-cars and golf-clubs, and that if it fell should
find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness. 

 don t think that. The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people,
particularly the wife. 

 No, don t really think that. But Paul was so broad-shouldered; all
kinds of extraordinary things made it worse, and knew that it would
never do--never. said to him after breakfast, when the others were
practising strokes,  We rather lost our heads,  and he looked better
at once, though frightfully ashamed. He began a speech about having no
money to marry on, but it hurt him to make it, and stopped him. Then
he said,  must beg your pardon over this, Miss Schlegel; can t think
what came over me last night.  And said,  Nor what over me; never
mind.  And then we parted--at least, until remembered that had
written straight off to tell you the night before, and that frightened
him again. asked him to send a telegram for me, for he knew you would
be coming or something; and he tried to get hold of the motor, but
Charles and Mr. Wilcox wanted it to go to the station; and Charles
offered to send the telegram for me, and then had to say that the
telegram was of no consequence, for Paul said Charles might read it, and
though wrote it out several times, he always said people would suspect
something. He took it himself at last, pretending that he must walk down
to get cartridges, and, what with one thing and the other, it was not
handed in at the post-office until too late. It was the most terrible
morning. Paul disliked me more and more, and Evie talked cricket
averages till nearly screamed. cannot think how stood her all the
other days. At last Charles and his father started for the station, and
then came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that
train, and Paul--oh, rather horrible--said that had muddled it. But
Mrs. Wilcox knew. 

 Knew what? 

 Everything; though we neither of us told her a word, and she had known
all along, think. 

 Oh, she must have overheard you. 

 suppose so, but it seemed wonderful. When Charles and Aunt Juley
drove up, calling each other names, Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the
garden and made everything less terrible. Ugh! but it has been a
disgusting business. To think that--  She sighed.

 To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment, there must
be all these telegrams and anger,  supplied Margaret.

Helen nodded.

 ve often thought about it, Helen. It s one of the most interesting
things in the world. The truth is that there is a great outer life that
you and have never touched--a life in which telegrams and anger count.
Personal relations, that we think supreme, are not supreme there. There
love means marriage settlements, death, death duties. So far m clear.
But here my difficulty. This outer life, though obviously horrid; often
seems the real one--there s grit in it. It does breed character. Do
personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end? 

 Oh, Meg--, that s what felt, only not so clearly, when the Wilcoxes
were so competent, and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes. 

 Don t you feel it now? 

 remember Paul at breakfast,  said Helen quietly.  shall never
forget him. He had nothing to fall back upon. know that personal
relations are the real life, for ever and ever. 

 Amen! 

So the Wilcox episode fell into the background, leaving behind it
memories of sweetness and horror that mingled, and the sisters pursued
the life that Helen had commended. They talked to each other and to
other people, they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with
those whom they liked or could befriend. They even attended public
meetings. In their own fashion they cared deeply about politics, though
not as politicians would have us care; they desired that public
life should mirror whatever is good in the life within. Temperance,
tolerance, and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them; whereas
they did not follow our Forward Policy in Tibet with the keen attention
that it merits, and would at times dismiss the whole British Empire with
a puzzled, if reverent, sigh. Not out of them are the shows of history
erected: the world would be a grey, bloodless place were it composed
entirely of Miss Schlegels. But the world being what it is, perhaps they
shine out in it like stars.

A word on their origin. They were not  English to the back-bone,  as
their aunt had piously asserted. But, on the other hand, they were not
 Germans of the dreadful sort.  Their father had belonged to a type that
was more prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now. He was not the
aggressive German, so dear to the English journalist, nor the domestic
German, so dear to the English wit. If one classed him at all it would
be as the countryman of Hegel and Kant, as the idealist, inclined to be
dreamy, whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air. Not that
his life had been inactive. He had fought like blazes against Denmark,
Austria, France. But he had fought without visualising the results of
victory. A hint of the truth broke on him after Sedan, when he saw the
dyed moustaches of Napoleon going grey; another when he entered Paris,
and saw the smashed windows of the Tuileries. Peace came--it was all
very immense, one had turned into an Empire--but he knew that some
quality had vanished for which not all Alsace-Lorraine could compensate
him. Germany a commercial Power, Germany a naval Power, Germany with
colonies here and a Forward Policy there, and legitimate aspirations in
the other place, might appeal to others, and be fitly served by
them; for his own part, he abstained from the fruits of victory, and
naturalised himself in England. The more earnest members of his family
never forgave him, and knew that his children, though scarcely English
of the dreadful sort, would never be German to the back-bone. He had
obtained work in one of our provincial universities, and there married
Poor Emily (or Die Englanderin, as the case may be), and as she had
money, they proceeded to London, and came to know a good many people.
But his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea. It was his hope that the
clouds of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time, and
the mild intellectual light re-emerge.  Do you imply that we Germans are
stupid, Uncle Ernst?  exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew. Uncle
Ernst replied,  To my mind. You use the intellect, but you no longer
care about it. That call stupidity.  As the haughty nephew did not
follow, he continued,  You only care about the things that you can use,
and therefore arrange them in the following order: Money, supremely
useful; intellect, rather useful; imagination, of no use at all.
No --for the other had protested-- your Pan-Germanism is no more
imaginative than is our Imperialism over here. It is the vice of a
vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square
miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and
that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That is
not imagination. No, it kills it. When their poets over here try to
celebrate bigness they are dead at once, and naturally. Your poets
too are dying, your philosophers, your musicians, to whom Europe has
listened for two hundred years. Gone. Gone with the little courts that
nurtured them--gone with Esterhazy and Weimar. What? What s that? Your
universities? Oh yes, you have learned men, who collect more facts
than do the learned men of England. They collect facts, and facts, and
empires of facts. But which of them will rekindle the light within? 

To all this Margaret listened, sitting on the haughty nephew s knee.

It was a unique education for the little girls. The haughty nephew would
be at Wickham Place one day, bringing with him an even haughtier wife,
both convinced that Germany was appointed by God to govern the world.
Aunt Juley would come the next day, convinced that Great Britain had
been appointed to the same post by the same authority. Were both these
loud-voiced parties right? On one occasion they had met and Margaret
with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her
presence. Whereat they blushed, and began to talk about the weather.
 Papa,  she cried--she was a most offensive child-- why will they not
discuss this most clear question?  Her father, surveying the parties
grimly, replied that he did not know. Putting her head on one side,
Margaret then remarked,  To me one of two things is very clear; either
God does not know his own mind about England and Germany, or else these
do not know the mind of God.  A hateful little girl, but at thirteen
she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without
perceiving. Her brain darted up and down; it grew pliant and strong. Her
conclusion was, that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any
organisation, and from this she never varied.

Helen advanced along the same lines, though with a more irresponsible
tread. In character she resembled her sister, but she was pretty, and so
apt to have a more amusing time. People gathered round her more readily,
especially when they were new acquaintances, and she did enjoy a little
homage very much. When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham
Place, she often absorbed the whole of the company, while Margaret--both
were tremendous talkers--fell flat. Neither sister bothered about this.
Helen never apologised afterwards, Margaret did not feel the slightest
rancour. But looks have their influence upon character. The sisters
were alike as little girls, but at the time of the Wilcox episode their
methods were beginning to diverge; the younger was rather apt to entice
people, and, in enticing them, to be herself enticed; the elder went
straight ahead, and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game.

Little need be premised about Tibby. He was now an intelligent man of
sixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile.",helen and her aunt returned to wickham place in a state of collapse  and for a little time margaret had three invalids on her hands  mrs  munt soon recovered  she possessed to a remarkable degree the power of distorting the past  and before many days were over she had forgotten the part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe  even at the crisis she had cried   thank goodness  poor margaret is saved this    which during the journey to london evolved into   it had to be gone through by some one   which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of  the one time really did help emily s girls was over the wilcox business   but helen was a more serious patient  new ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap  and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned   the truth was that she had fallen in love  not with an individual  but with a family   before paul arrived she had  as it were  been tuned up into his key  the energy of the wilcoxes had fascinated her  had created new images of beauty in her responsive mind  to be all day with them in the open air  to sleep at night under their roof  had seemed the supreme joy of life  and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude to love  she had liked giving in to mr  wilcox  or evie  or charles  she had liked being told that her notions of life were sheltered or academic  that equality was nonsense  votes for women nonsense  socialism nonsense  art and literature  except when conducive to strengthening the character  nonsense  one by one the schlegel fetiches had been overthrown  and  though professing to defend them  she had rejoiced  when mr  wilcox said that one sound man of business did more good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers  she had swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp  and had leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar  when charles said   why be so polite to servants  they don t understand it   she had not given the schlegel retort of   if they don t understand it  do   no  she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future   am swathed in cannot   she thought   and it is good for me to be stripped of it   and all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for paul  paul was inevitable  charles was taken up with another girl  mr  wilcox was so old  evie so young  mrs  wilcox so different  round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of romance  to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days  to feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal  he and she were about the same age  evie said  most people thought paul handsomer than his brother  he was certainly a better shot  though not so good at golf  and when paul appeared  flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination  and ready to flirt with any pretty girl  helen met him halfway  or more than halfway  and turned towards him on the sunday evening   he had been talking of his approaching exile in nigeria  and he should have continued to talk of it  and allowed their guest to recover  but the heave of her bosom flattered him  passion was possible  and he became passionate  deep down in him something whispered   this girl would let you kiss her  you might not have such a chance again    that was  how it happened   or  rather  how helen described it to her sister  using words even more unsympathetic than my own  but the poetry of that kiss  the wonder of it  the magic that there was in life for hours after it  who can describe that  it is so easy for an englishman to sneer at these chance collisions of human beings  to the insular cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity  it is so easy to talk of  passing emotion   and to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it passed  our impulse to sneer  to forget  is at root a good one  we recognise that emotion is not enough  and that men and women are personalities capable of sustained relations  not mere opportunities for an electrical discharge  yet we rate the impulse too highly  we do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open  to helen  at all events  her life was to bring nothing more intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it  he had drawn her out of the house  where there was danger of surprise and light  he had led her by a path he knew  until they stood under the column of the vast wych elm  a man in the darkness  he had whispered  love you  when she was desiring love  in time his slender personality faded  the scene that he had evoked endured  in all the variable years that followed she never saw the like of it again    understand   said margaret    at least  understand as much as ever is understood of these things  tell me now what happened on the monday morning     it was over at once     how  helen     was still happy while dressed  but as came downstairs got nervous  and when went into the dining room knew it was no good  there was evie  can t explain  managing the tea urn  and mr  wilcox reading the times     was paul there     yes  and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares  and he looked frightened    by slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other  margaret saw horror latent in the scene  and helen s next remark did not surprise her    somehow  when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful  it is all right for us to be frightened  or for men of another sort  father  for instance  but for men like that  when saw all the others so placid  and paul mad with terror in case said the wrong thing  felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud  just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs  and that if it fell should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness     don t think that  the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people  particularly the wife     no  don t really think that  but paul was so broad shouldered  all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse  and knew that it would never do  never  said to him after breakfast  when the others were practising strokes   we rather lost our heads   and he looked better at once  though frightfully ashamed  he began a speech about having no money to marry on  but it hurt him to make it  and stopped him  then he said   must beg your pardon over this  miss schlegel  can t think what came over me last night   and said   nor what over me  never mind   and then we parted  at least  until remembered that had written straight off to tell you the night before  and that frightened him again  asked him to send a telegram for me  for he knew you would be coming or something  and he tried to get hold of the motor  but charles and mr  wilcox wanted it to go to the station  and charles offered to send the telegram for me  and then had to say that the telegram was of no consequence  for paul

4,4,654,828,1002,"It will be generally admitted that Beethoven s Fifth Symphony is the
most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man. All
sorts and conditions are satisfied by it. Whether you are like Mrs.
Munt, and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come--of course, not so as
to disturb the others--or like Helen, who can see heroes and shipwrecks
in the music s flood; or like Margaret, who can only see the music; or
like Tibby, who is profoundly versed in counterpoint, and holds the full
score open on his knee; or like their cousin, Fraulein Mosebach, who
remembers all the time that Beethoven is echt Deutsch; or like Fraulein
Mosebach s young man, who can remember nothing but Fraulein Mosebach: in
any case, the passion of your life becomes more vivid, and you are bound
to admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings. It is cheap, even
if you hear it in the Queen s Hall, dreariest music-room in London,
though not as dreary as the Free Trade Hall, Manchester; and even if
you sit on the extreme left of that hall, so that the brass bumps at you
before the rest of the orchestra arrives, it is still cheap.

 Whom is Margaret talking to?  said Mrs. Munt, at the conclusion of the
first movement. She was again in London on a visit to Wickham Place.

Helen looked down the long line of their party, and said that she did
not know.

 Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in? 

 expect so,  Helen replied. Music enwrapped her, and she could not
enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an
interest in from young men whom one knows.

 You girls are so wonderful in always having--Oh dear! one mustn t
talk. 

For the Andante had begun--very beautiful, but bearing a family likeness
to all the other beautiful Andantes that Beethoven had written, and,
to Helen s mind, rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the
first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third. She heard the
tune through once, and then her attention wandered, and she gazed at the
audience, or the organ, or the architecture. Much did she censure
the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen s
Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow
pantaloons, on which the October sunlight struck.  How awful to marry a
man like those Cupids!  thought Helen. Here Beethoven started decorating
his tune, so she heard him through once more, and then she smiled at
her Cousin Frieda. But Frieda, listening to Classical Music, could not
respond. Herr Liesecke, too, looked as if wild horses could not make him
inattentive; there were lines across his forehead, his lips were parted,
his pince-nez at right angles to his nose, and he had laid a thick,
white hand on either knee. And next to her was Aunt Juley, so British,
and wanting to tap. How interesting that row of people was! What diverse
influences had gone to the making! Here Beethoven, after humming and
hawing with great sweetness, said  Heigho,  and the Andante came to an
end. Applause, and a round of  wunderschoning  and pracht volleying from
the German contingent. Margaret started talking to her new young man;
Helen said to her aunt:  Now comes the wonderful movement: first of all
the goblins, and then a trio of elephants dancing ; and Tibby implored
the company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the
drum.

 On the what, dear? 

 On the drum, Aunt Juley. 

 No; look out for the part where you think you have done with the
goblins and they come back,  breathed Helen, as the music started with
a goblin walking quietly over the universe, from end to end. Others
followed him. They were not aggressive creatures; it was that that made
them so terrible to Helen. They merely observed in passing that there
was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world. After the
interlude of elephants dancing, they returned and made the observation
for the second time. Helen could not contradict them, for, once at all
events, she had felt the same, and had seen the reliable walls of youth
collapse. Panic and emptiness! Panic and emptiness! The goblins were
right. Her brother raised his finger; it was the transitional passage on
the drum.

For, as if things were going too far, Beethoven took hold of the goblins
and made them do what he wanted. He appeared in person. He gave them
a little push, and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a
minor, and then--he blew with his mouth and they were scattered! Gusts
of splendour, gods and demigods contending with vast swords, colour
and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle, magnificent victory,
magnificent death! Oh, it all burst before the girl, and she even
stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible. Any fate was
titanic; any contest desirable; conqueror and conquered would alike be
applauded by the angels of the utmost stars.

And the goblins--they had not really been there at all? They were only
the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief? One healthy human impulse would
dispel them? Men like the Wilcoxes, or ex-President Roosevelt, would
say yes. Beethoven knew better. The goblins really had been there. They
might return--and they did. It was as if the splendour of life might
boil over and waste to steam and froth. In its dissolution one heard the
terrible, ominous note, and a goblin, with increased malignity, walked
quietly over the universe from end to end. Panic and emptiness! Panic
and emptiness! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall.
Beethoven chose to make all right in the end. He built the ramparts up.
He blew with his mouth for the second time, and again the goblins were
scattered. He brought back the gusts of splendour, the heroism, the
youth, the magnificence of life and of death, and, amid vast roarings of
a superhuman joy, he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion. But the
goblins were there. They could return. He had said so bravely, and that
is why one can trust Beethoven when he says other things.

Helen pushed her way out during the applause. She desired to be alone.
The music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in
her career.

She read it as a tangible statement, which could never be superseded.
The notes meant this and that to her, and they could have no other
meaning, and life could have no other meaning. She pushed right out of
the building and walked slowly down the outside staircase, breathing the
autumnal air, and then she strolled home.

 Margaret,  called Mrs. Munt,  is Helen all right? 

 Oh yes. 

 She is always going away in the middle of a programme,  said Tibby.

 The music has evidently moved her deeply,  said Fraulein Mosebach.

 Excuse me,  said Margaret s young man, who had for some time been
preparing a sentence,  but that lady has, quite inadvertently, taken my
umbrella. 

 Oh, good gracious me!--am so sorry. Tibby, run after Helen. 

 shall miss the Four Serious Songs if do. 

 Tibby, love, you must go. 

 It isn t of any consequence,  said the young man, in truth a little
uneasy about his umbrella.

 But of course it is. Tibby! Tibby! 

Tibby rose to his feet, and wilfully caught his person on the backs of
the chairs. By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his
hat, and had deposited his full score in safety, it was  too late  to
go after Helen. The Four Serious Songs had begun, and one could not move
during their performance.

 My sister is so careless,  whispered Margaret.

 Not at all,  replied the young man; but his voice was dead and cold.

 If you would give me your address-- 

 Oh, not at all, not at all;  and he wrapped his greatcoat over his
knees.

Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in Margaret s ears. Brahms, for
all his grumbling and grizzling, had never guessed what it felt like
to be suspected of stealing an umbrella. For this fool of a young man
thought that she and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence
trick on him, and that if he gave his address they would break into
his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walking-stick too. Most
ladies would have laughed, but Margaret really minded, for it gave her
a glimpse into squalor. To trust people is a luxury in which only the
wealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it. As soon as Brahms had
grunted himself out, she gave him her card and said,  That is where
we live; if you preferred, you could call for the umbrella after the
concert, but didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our
fault. 

His face brightened a little when he saw that Wickham Place was W. It
was sad to see him corroded with suspicion, and yet not daring to be
impolite, in case these well-dressed people were honest after all. She
took it as a good sign that he said to her,  It s a fine programme
this afternoon, is it not?  for this was the remark with which he had
originally opened, before the umbrella intervened.

 The Beethoven s fine,  said Margaret, who was not a female of the
encouraging type.  don t like the Brahms, though, nor the Mendelssohn
that came first and ugh! don t like this Elgar that s coming. 

 What, what?  called Herr Liesecke, overhearing.  The  Pomp and
Circumstance  will not be fine? 

 Oh, Margaret, you tiresome girl!  cried her aunt.

 Here have been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for  Pomp and
Circumstance,  and you are undoing all my work. am so anxious for him
to hear what WE are doing in music. Oh,--you musn t run down our English
composers, Margaret. 

 For my part, have heard the composition at Stettin,  said Fraulein
Mosebach,  on two occasions. It is dramatic, a little. 

 Frieda, you despise English music. You know you do. And English art.
And English literature, except Shakespeare, and he s a German. Very
well, Frieda, you may go. 

The lovers laughed and glanced at each other. Moved by a common impulse,
they rose to their feet and fled from  Pomp and Circumstance. 

 We have this call to pay in Finsbury Circus, it is true,  said Herr
Liesecke, as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music
started.

 Margaret--  loudly whispered by Aunt Juley.

 Margaret, Margaret! Fraulein Mosebach has left her beautiful little bag
behind her on the seat. 

Sure enough, there was Frieda s reticule, containing her address book,
her pocket dictionary, her map of London, and her money.

 Oh, what a bother--what a family we are! Fr--frieda! 

 Hush!  said all those who thought the music fine.

 But it s the number they want in Finsbury Circus. 

 Might I--couldn t I--  said the suspicious young man, and got very red.

 Oh, would be so grateful. 

He took the bag--money clinking inside it--and slipped up the gangway
with it. He was just in time to catch them at the swing-door, and he
received a pretty smile from the German girl and a fine bow from her
cavalier. He returned to his seat upsides with the world. The trust that
they had reposed in him was trivial, but he felt that it cancelled his
mistrust for them, and that probably he would not be  had  over his
umbrella. This young man had been  had  in the past badly, perhaps
overwhelmingly--and now most of his energies went in defending himself
against the unknown. But this afternoon--perhaps on account of music--he
perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good
of being alive? Wickham Place, W., though a risk, was as safe as most
things, and he would risk it.

So when the concert was over and Margaret said,  We live quite near; am going there now. Could you walk round with me, and we ll find your
umbrella?  he said,  Thank you,  peaceably, and followed her out of
the Queen s Hall. She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady
downstairs, or to carry a lady s programme for her--his class was near
enough her own for its manners to vex her. But she found him interesting
on the whole--every one interested the Schlegels on the whole at that
time--and while her lips talked culture, her heart was planning to
invite him to tea.

 How tired one gets after music!  she began.

 Do you find the atmosphere of Queen s Hall oppressive? 

 Yes, horribly. 

 But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive. 

 Do you go there much? 

 When my work permits, attend the gallery for the Royal Opera. 

Helen would have exclaimed,  So do I. love the gallery,  and thus
have endeared herself to the young man. Helen could do these things. But
Margaret had an almost morbid horror of  drawing people out,  of  making
things go.  She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden, but she did
not  attend  it, preferring the more expensive seats; still less did she
love it. So she made no reply.

 This year have been three times--to  Faust,   Tosca,  and--  Was it
 Tannhouser  or  Tannhoyser ? Better not risk the word.

Margaret disliked  Tosca  and  Faust.  And so, for one reason and
another, they walked on in silence, chaperoned by the voice of Mrs.
Munt, who was getting into difficulties with her nephew.

 do in a WAY remember the passage, Tibby, but when every instrument is
so beautiful, it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another.
am sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts. Not a
dull note from beginning to end. only wish that our German friends had
stayed till it finished. 

 But surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low
C, Aunt Juley?  came Tibby s voice.  No one could. It s unmistakable. 

 A specially loud part?  hazarded Mrs. Munt.  Of course do not go
in for being musical,  she added, the shot failing.  only care for
music--a very different thing. But still will say this for myself--do know when like a thing and when don t. Some people are the same
about pictures. They can go into a picture gallery--Miss Conder can--and
say straight off what they feel, all round the wall. never could do
that. But music is so different from pictures, to my mind. When it comes
to music am as safe as houses, and assure you, Tibby, am by no
means pleased by everything. There was a thing--something about a faun
in French--which Helen went into ecstasies over, but thought it most
tinkling and superficial, and said so, and held to my opinion too. 

 Do you agree?  asked Margaret.  Do you think music is so different from
pictures? 

 I--should have thought so, kind of,  he said.

 So should I. Now, my sister declares they re just the same. We have
great arguments over it. She says m dense; say she s sloppy. 
 Getting under way, she cried:  Now, doesn t it seem absurd to you? What
is the good of the Arts if they re interchangeable? What is the good
of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye? Helen s one aim is to
translate tunes into the language of painting, and pictures into the
language of music. It s very ingenious, and she says several pretty
things in the process, but what s gained, d like to know? Oh, it s
all rubbish, radically false. If Monet s really Debussy, and Debussy s
really Monet, neither gentleman is worth his salt--that s my opinion. 

Evidently these sisters quarrelled.

 Now, this very symphony that we ve just been having--she won t let it
alone. She labels it with meanings from start to finish; turns it into
literature. wonder if the day will ever return when music will be
treated as music. Yet don t know. There s my brother--behind us. He
treats music as music, and oh, my goodness! He makes me angrier than any
one, simply furious. With him daren t even argue. 

An unhappy family, if talented.

 But, of course, the real villain is Wagner. He has done more than any
man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts. do feel that music is in a very serious state just now, though
extraordinarily interesting. Every now and then in history there do
come these terrible geniuses, like Wagner, who stir up all the wells of
thought at once. For a moment it s splendid. Such a splash as never
was. But afterwards--such a lot of mud; and the wells--as it were, they
communicate with each other too easily now, and not one of them will run
quite clear. That s what Wagner s done. 

Her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds. If only he
could talk like this, he would have caught the world. Oh, to acquire
culture! Oh, to pronounce foreign names correctly! Oh, to be well
informed, discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started! But
it would take one years. With an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours
in the evening, how was it possible to catch up with leisured women,
who had been reading steadily from childhood? His brain might be full
of names, he might have even heard of Monet and Debussy; the trouble
was that he could not string them together into a sentence, he could not
make them  tell,  he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella.
Yes, the umbrella was the real trouble. Behind Monet and Debussy the
umbrella persisted, with the steady beat of a drum.  suppose my
umbrella will be all right,  he was thinking.  don t really mind about
it. will think about music instead. suppose my umbrella will be all
right.  Earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats. Ought he
to have paid as much as two shillings? Earlier still he had wondered,
 Shall try to do without a programme?  There had always been something
to worry him ever since he could remember, always something that
distracted him in the pursuit of beauty. For he did pursue beauty, and,
therefore, Margaret s speeches did flutter away from him like birds.

Margaret talked ahead, occasionally saying,  Don t you think so? don t
you feel the same?  And once she stopped, and said,  Oh, do interrupt
me!  which terrified him. She did not attract him, though she filled him
with awe. Her figure was meagre, her face seemed all teeth and eyes, her
references to her sister and her brother were uncharitable. For all
her cleverness and culture, she was probably one of those soulless,
atheistical women who have been so shown up by Miss Corelli. It was
surprising (and alarming) that she should suddenly say,  do hope that
you ll come in and have some tea. We should be so glad. have dragged
you so far out of your way. 

They had arrived at Wickham Place. The sun had set, and the backwater,
in deep shadow, was filling with a gentle haze. To the right the
fantastic sky-line of the flats towered black against the hues of
evening; to the left the older houses raised a square-cut, irregular
parapet against the grey. Margaret fumbled for her latch-key. Of course
she had forgotten it. So, grasping her umbrella by its ferrule, she
leant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window.

 Helen! Let us in! 

 All right,  said a voice.

 You ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella. 

 Taken a what?  said Helen, opening the door.  Oh, what s that? Do come
in! How do you do? 

 Helen, you must not be so ramshackly. You took this gentleman s
umbrella away from Queen s Hall, and he has had the trouble of coming
round for it. 

 Oh, am so sorry!  cried Helen, all her hair flying. She had pulled
off her hat as soon as she returned, and had flung herself into the
big dining-room chair.  do nothing but steal umbrellas. am so very
sorry! Do come in and choose one. Is yours a hooky or a nobbly? Mine s a
nobbly--at least, THINK it is. 

The light was turned on, and they began to search the hall, Helen, who
had abruptly parted with the Fifth Symphony, commenting with shrill
little cries.

 Don t you talk, Meg! You stole an old gentleman s silk top-hat. Yes,
she did, Aunt Juley. It is a positive fact. She thought it was a muff.
Oh, heavens! ve knocked the In-and-Out card down. Where s Frieda?
Tibby, why don t you ever--No, can t remember what was going to say.
That wasn t it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up. What about this
umbrella?  She opened it.  No, it s all gone along the seams. It s an
appalling umbrella. It must be mine. 

But it was not.

He took it from her, murmured a few words of thanks, and then fled, with
the lilting step of the clerk.

 But if you will stop--  cried Margaret.  Now, Helen, how stupid you ve
been! 

 Whatever have done? 

 Don t you see that you ve frightened him away? meant him to stop to
tea. You oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella. saw
his nice eyes getting so miserable. No, it s not a bit of good now.  For
Helen had darted out into the street, shouting,  Oh, do stop! 

 dare say it is all for the best,  opined Mrs. Munt.  We know nothing
about the young man, Margaret, and your drawing-room is full of very
tempting little things. 

But Helen cried:  Aunt Juley, how can you! You make me more and more
ashamed. d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons
than that I--Well, must shut the front-door, suppose. One more
failure for Helen. 

 Yes, think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent,  said
Margaret. Seeing that her aunt did not understand, she added:  You
remember  rent ? It was one of father s words--Rent to the ideal, to his
own faith in human nature. You remember how he would trust strangers,
and if they fooled him he would say,  It s better to be fooled than to
be suspicious --that the confidence trick is the work of man, but the
want-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil. 

 remember something of the sort now,  said Mrs. Munt, rather tartly,
for she longed to add,  It was lucky that your father married a wife
with money.  But this was unkind, and she contented herself with,  Why,
he might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well. 

 Better that he had,  said Helen stoutly.

 No, agree with Aunt Juley,  said Margaret.  d rather mistrust
people than lose my little Ricketts. There are limits. 

Their brother, finding the incident commonplace, had stolen upstairs to
see whether there were scones for tea. He warmed the teapot--almost too
deftly--rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided,
poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with really
boiling water, and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would
lose the aroma.

 All right, Auntie Tibby,  called Helen, while Margaret, thoughtful
again, said:  In a way, wish we had a real boy in the house--the kind
of boy who cares for men. It would make entertaining so much easier. 

 So do I,  said her sister.  Tibby only cares for cultured females
singing Brahms.  And when they joined him she said rather sharply:  Why
didn t you make that young man welcome, Tibby? You must do the host a
little, you know. You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into
stopping, instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women. 

Tibby sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead.

 Oh, it s no good looking superior. mean what say. 

 Leave Tibby alone!  said Margaret, who could not bear her brother to be
scolded.

 Here s the house a regular hen-coop!  grumbled Helen.

 Oh, my dear!  protested Mrs. Munt.  How can you say such dreadful
things! The number of men you get here has always astonished me. If
there is any danger it s the other way round. 

 Yes, but it s the wrong sort of men, Helen means. 

 No, don t,  corrected Helen.  We get the right sort of man, but the
wrong side of him, and say that s Tibby s fault. There ought to be a
something about the house--an--don t know what. 

 A touch of the W s, perhaps? 

Helen put out her tongue.

 Who are the W s?  asked Tibby.

 The W s are things and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you don t,
so there! 

 suppose that ours is a female house,  said Margaret,  and one must
just accept it. No, Aunt Juley, don t mean that this house is full of
women. am trying to say something much more clever. mean that it
was irrevocably feminine, even in father s time. Now m sure you
understand! Well, ll give you another example. It ll shock you, but
don t care. Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner-party, and that
the guests had been Leighton, Millais, Swinburne, Rossetti, Meredith,
Fitzgerald, etc. Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would
have been artistic? Heavens, no! The very chairs on which they sat would
have seen to that. So with our house--it must be feminine, and all we
can do is to see that it isn t effeminate. Just as another house that
can mention, but won t, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its
inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal. 

 That house being the W s house, presume,  said Tibby.

 You re not going to be told about the W s, my child,  Helen cried,  so
don t you think it. And on the other hand, don t the least mind if
you find out, so don t you think you ve done anything clever, in either
case. Give me a cigarette. 

 You do what you can for the house,  said Margaret.  The drawing-room
reeks of smoke. 

 If you smoked too, the house might suddenly turn masculine. Atmosphere
is probably a question of touch and go. Even at Queen Victoria s
dinner-party--if something had been just a little Different--perhaps if
she d worn a clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin. 

 With an India shawl over her shoulders-- 

 Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm-pin. 

Bursts of disloyal laughter--you must remember that they are half
German--greeted these suggestions, and Margaret said pensively,  How
inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art.  And the
conversation drifted away and away, and Helen s cigarette turned to
a spot in the darkness, and the great flats opposite were sown with
lighted windows which vanished and were relit again, and vanished
incessantly. Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently--a tide that
could never be quiet, while in the east, invisible behind the smokes of
Wapping, the moon was rising.

 That reminds me, Margaret. We might have taken that young man into
the dining-room, at all events. Only the majolica plate--and that is so
firmly set in the wall. am really distressed that he had no tea. 

For that little incident had impressed the three women more than might
be supposed. It remained as a goblin footfall, as a hint that all is not
for the best in the best of all possible worlds, and that beneath these
superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed boy, who has
recovered his umbrella indeed, but who has left no address behind him,
and no name.",it will be generally admitted that beethoven s fifth symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man  all sorts and conditions are satisfied by it  whether you are like mrs  munt  and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come  of course  not so as to disturb the others  or like helen  who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music s flood  or like

go    the lovers laughed and glanced at each other  moved by a common impulse  they rose to their feet and fled from  pomp and circumstance     we have this call to pay in finsbury circus  it is true   said herr liesecke  as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music started    margaret    loudly whispered by aunt juley    margaret  margaret  fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat    sure enough  there was frieda s reticule  containing her address book  her pocket dictionary  her map of london  and her money    oh  what a bother  what a family we are  fr  frieda     hush   said all those who thought the music fine    but it s the number they want in finsbury circus     might i  couldn t i    said the suspicious young man  and got very red    oh  would be so grateful    he took the bag  money clinking inside it  and slipped up the gangway with it  he was just in time to catch them at the swing door  and he received a pretty smile from the german girl and a fine bow from her cavalier  he returned to his seat upsides with the world  the trust that they had reposed in him was trivial  but he felt that it cancelled his mistrust for them  and that probably he would not be  had  over his umbrella  this young man had been  had  in the past badly  perhaps overwhelmingly  and now most of his energies went in defending himself against the unknown  but this afternoon  perhaps on account of music  he perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good of being alive  wickham place  w   though a risk  was as safe as most things  and he would risk it   so when the concert was over and margaret said   we live quite near  am going there now  could you walk round with me  and we ll find your umbrella   he said   thank you   peaceably  and followed her out of the queen s hall  she wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs  or to carry a lady s programme for her  his class was near enough her own for its manners to vex her  but she found him interesting on the whole  every one interested the schlegels on the whole at that time  and while her lips talked culture  her heart was planning to invite him to tea    how tired one gets after music   she began    do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive     yes  horribly     but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive     do you go there much     when my work permits  attend the gallery for the royal opera    helen would have exclaimed   so do i  love the gallery   and thus have endeared herself to the young man  helen could do these things  but margaret had an almost morbid horror of  drawing people out   of  making things go   she had been to the gallery at covent garden  but she did not  attend  it  preferring the more expensive seats  still less did she love it  so she made no reply    this year have been three times  to  faust    tosca   and    was it  tannhouser  or  tannhoyser   better not risk the word   margaret disliked  tosca  and  faust   and so  for one reason and another  they walked on in silence  chaperoned by the voice of mrs  munt  who was getting into difficulties with her nephew    do in a way remember the passage  tibby  but when every instrument is so beautiful  it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another  am sure that you and helen take me to the very nicest concerts  not a dull note from beginning to end  only wish that our german friends had stayed till it finished     but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c  aunt juley   came tibby s voice   no one could  it s unmistakable     a specially loud part   hazarded mrs  munt   of course do not go in for being musical   she added  the shot failing   only care for music  a very different thing  but still will say this for myself  do know when like a thing and when don t  some people are the same about pictures  they can go into a picture gallery  miss conder can  and say straight off what they feel  all round the wall  never could do that  but music is so different from pictures  to my mind  when it comes to music am as safe as houses  and assure you  tibby  am by no means pleased by everything  there was a thing  something about a faun in french  which helen went into ecstasies over  but thought it most tinkling and superficial  and said so  and held to my opinion too     do you agree   asked margaret   do you think music is so different from pictures     i  should have thought so  kind of   he said    so should i  now  my sister declares they re just the same  we have great arguments over it  she says m dense  say she s sloppy    getting under way  she cried   now  doesn t it seem absurd to you  what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable  what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye  helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting  and pictures into the language of music  it s very ingenious  and she says several pretty things in the process  but what s gained  d like to know  oh  it s all rubbish  radically false  if monet s really debussy  and debussy s really monet  neither gentleman is worth his salt  that s my opinion    evidently these sisters quarrelled    now  this very symphony that we ve just been having  she won t let it alone  she labels it with meanings from start to finish  turns it into literature  wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music  yet don t know  there s my brother  behind us  he treats music as music  and oh  my goodness  he makes me angrier than any one  simply furious  with him daren t even argue    an unhappy family  if talented    but  of course  the real villain is wagner  he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts  do feel that music is in a very serious state just now  though extraordinarily interesting  every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses  like wagner  who stir up all the wells of thought at once  for a moment it s splendid  such a splash as never was  but afterwards  such a lot of mud  and the wells  as it were  they communicate with each other too easily now  and not one of them will run quite clear  that s what wagner s done    her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds  if only he could talk like this  he would have caught the world  oh  to acquire culture  oh  to pronounce foreign names correctly  oh  to be well informed  discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started  but it would take one years  with an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours in the evening  how was it possible to catch up with leisured women  who had been reading steadily from childhood  his brain might be full of names  he might have even heard of monet and debussy  the trouble was that he could not string them together into a sentence  he could not make them  tell   he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella  yes  the umbrella was the real trouble  behind monet and debussy the umbrella persisted  with the steady beat of a drum   suppose my umbrella will be all right   he was thinking   don t really mind about it  will think about music instead  suppose my umbrella will be all right   earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats  ought he to have paid as much as two shillings  earlier still he had wondered   shall try to do without a programme   there had always been something to worry him ever since he could remember  always something that distracted him in the pursuit of beauty  for he did pursue beauty  and  therefore  margaret s speeches did flutter away from him like birds   margaret talked ahead  occasionally saying   don t you think so  don t you feel the same   and once she stopped  and said   oh  do interrupt me   which terrified him  she did not attract him  though she filled him with awe  her figure was meagre  her face seemed all teeth and eyes  her references to her sister and her brother were uncharitable  for all her cleverness and culture  she was probably one of those soulless  atheistical women who have been so shown up by miss corelli  it was surprising  and alarming  that she should suddenly say   do hope that you ll come in and have some tea  we should be so glad  have dragged you so far out of your way    they had arrived at wickham place  the sun had set  and the backwater  in deep shadow  was filling with a gentle haze  to the right the fantastic sky line of the flats towered black against the hues of evening  to the left the older houses raised a square cut  irregular parapet against the grey  margaret fumbled for her latch key  of course she had forgotten it  so  grasping her umbrella by its ferrule  she leant over the area and tapped at the dining room window    helen  let us in     all right   said a voice    you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella     taken a what   said helen  opening the door   oh  what s that  do come in  how do you do     helen  you must not be so ramshackly  you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall  and he has had the trouble of coming round for it     oh  am so sorry   cried helen  all her hair flying  she had pulled off her hat as soon as she returned  and had flung herself into the big dining room chair   do nothing but steal umbrellas  am so very sorry  do come in and choose one  is yours a hooky or a nobbly  mine s a nobbly  at least  think it is    the light was turned on  and they began to search the hall  helen  who had abruptly parted with the fifth symphony  commenting with shrill little cries    don t you talk  meg  you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat  yes  she did  aunt juley  it is a positive fact  she thought it was a muff  oh  heavens  ve knocked the in and out card down  where s frieda  tibby  why don t you ever  no  can t remember what was going to say  that wasn t it  but do tell the maids to hurry tea up  what about this umbrella   she opened it   no  it s all gone along the seams  it s an appalling umbrella  it must be mine    but it was not   he took it from her  murmured a few words of thanks  and then fled  with the lilting step of the clerk    but if you will stop    cried margaret   now  helen  how stupid you ve been     whatever have done     don t you see that you ve frightened him away  meant him to stop to tea  you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella  saw his nice eyes getting so miserable  no  it s not a bit of good now   for helen had darted out into the street  shouting   oh  do stop     dare say it is all for the best   opined mrs  munt   we know nothing about the young man  margaret  and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things    but helen cried   aunt juley  how can you  you make me more and more ashamed  d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i  well  must shut the front door  suppose  one more failure for helen     yes  think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent   said margaret  seeing that her aunt did not understand  she added   you remember  rent   it was one of father s words  rent to the ideal  to his own faith in human nature  you remember how he would trust strangers  and if they fooled him he would say   it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious   that the confidence trick is the work of man  but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil     remember something of the sort now   said mrs  munt  rather tartly  for she longed to add   it was lucky that your father married a wife with money   but this was unkind  and she contented herself with   why  he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well     better that he had   said helen stoutly    no  agree with aunt juley   said margaret   d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts  there are limits    their brother  finding the incident commonplace  had stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea  he warmed the teapot  almost too deftly  rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour maid had provided  poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend  filled up with really boiling water  and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would lose the aroma    all right  auntie tibby   called helen  while margaret  thoughtful again  said   in a way  wish we had a real boy in the house  the kind of boy who cares for men  it would make entertaining so much easier     so do i   said her sister   tibby only cares for cultured females singing brahms   and when they joined him she said rather sharply   why didn t you make that young man welcome  tibby  you must do the host a little  you know  you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping  instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women    tibby sighed  and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead    oh  it s no good looking superior  mean what say     leave tibby alone   said margaret  who could not bear her brother to be scolded    here s the house a regular hen coop   grumbled helen    oh  my dear   protested mrs  munt   how can you say such dreadful things  the number of men you get here has always astonished me  if there is any danger it s the other way round     yes  but it s the wrong sort of men  helen means     no  don t   corrected helen   we get the right sort of man  but the wrong side of him  and say that s tibby s fault  there ought to be a something about the house  an  don t know what     a touch of the w s  perhaps    helen put out her tongue    who are the w s   asked tibby    the w s are things and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t  so there     suppose that ours is a female house   said margaret   and one must just accept it  no  aunt juley  don t mean that this house is full of women  am trying to say something much more clever  mean that it was irrevocably feminine  even in father s time  now m sure you understand  well  ll give you another example  it ll shock you  but don t care  suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party  and that the guests had been leighton  millais  swinburne  rossetti  meredith  fitzgerald  etc  do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic  heavens  no  the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that  so with our house  it must be feminine  and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate  just as another house that can mention  but won t  sounded irrevocably masculine  and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal     that house being the w s house  presume   said tibby    you re not going to be told about the w s  my child   helen cried   so don t you think it  and on the other hand  don t the least mind if you find out  so don t you think you ve done anything clever  in either case  give me a cigarette     you do what you can for the house   said margaret   the drawing room reeks of smoke     if you smoked too  the house might suddenly turn masculine  atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go  even at queen victoria s dinner party  if something had been just a little different  perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin     with an india shawl over her shoulders      fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin    bursts of disloyal laughter  you must remember that they are half german  greeted these suggestions  and margaret said pensively   how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art   and the conversation drifted away and away  and helen s cigarette turned to a spot in the darkness  and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted windows which vanished and were relit again  and vanished incessantly  beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently  a tide that could never be quiet  while in the east  invisible behind the smokes of wapping  the moon was rising    that reminds me  margaret  we might have taken that young man into the dining room  at all events  only the majolica plate  and that is so firmly set in the wall  am really distressed that he had no tea    for that little incident had impressed the three women more than might be supposed  it remained as a goblin footfall  as a hint that all is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds  and that beneath these superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill fed boy  who has recovered his umbrella indeed  but who has left no address behind him  and no

WE are not concerned with the very poor. They are unthinkable and only
to be approached by the statistician or the poet. This story deals
with gentlefolk, or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are
gentlefolk.

The boy, Leonard Bast, stood at the extreme verge of gentility. He was
not in the abyss, but he could see it, and at times people whom he knew
had dropped in, and counted no more. He knew that he was poor, and would
admit it; he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to
the rich. This may be splendid of him. But he was inferior to most rich
people, there is not the least doubt of it. He was not as courteous
as the average rich man, nor as intelligent, nor as healthy, nor as
lovable. His mind and his body had been alike underfed, because he was
poor, and because he was modern they were always craving better food.
Had he lived some centuries ago, in the brightly coloured civilisations
of the past, he would have had a definite status, his rank and his
income would have corresponded. But in his day the angel of Democracy
had arisen, enshadowing the classes with leathern wings, and
proclaiming,  All men are equal--all men, that is to say, who possess
umbrellas,  and so he was obliged to assert gentility, lest he slip
into the abyss where nothing counts, and the statements of Democracy are
inaudible.

As he walked away from Wickham Place, his first care was to prove that
he was as good as the Miss Schlegels. Obscurely wounded in his pride, he
tried to wound them in return. They were probably not ladies. Would real
ladies have asked him to tea? They were certainly ill-natured and cold.
At each step his feeling of superiority increased. Would a real lady
have talked about stealing an umbrella? Perhaps they were thieves
after all, and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a
chloroformed handkerchief over his face. He walked on complacently as
far as the Houses of Parliament. There an empty stomach asserted itself,
and told him that he was a fool.

 Evening, Mr. Bast. 

 Evening, Mr. Dealtry. 

 Nice evening. 

 Evening. 

Mr. Dealtry, a fellow clerk, passed on, and Leonard stood wondering
whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him, or
whether he would walk. He decided to walk--it is no good giving in,
and he had spent money enough at Queen s Hall--and he walked over
Westminster Bridge, in front of St. Thomas s Hospital, and through
the immense tunnel that passes under the South-Western main line at
Vauxhall. In the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the
trains. A sharp pain darted through his head, and he was conscious of
the exact form of his eye sockets. He pushed on for another mile, and
did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called
Camelia Road which was at present his home.

Here he stopped again, and glanced suspiciously to right and left,
like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole. A block of flats,
constructed with extreme cheapness, towered on either hand. Farther down
the road two more blocks were being built, and beyond these an old house
was being demolished to accommodate another pair. It was the kind
of scene that may be observed all over London, whatever the
locality--bricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of
the water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her
soil. Camelia Road would soon stand out like a fortress, and command,
for a little, an extensive view. Only for a little. Plans were out for
the erection of flats in Magnolia Road also. And again a few years, and
all the flats in either road might be pulled down, and new buildings, of
a vastness at present unimaginable, might arise where they had fallen.

 Evening, Mr. Bast. 

 Evening, Mr. Cunningham. 

 Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester. 

 I beg your pardon? 

 Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester, 
 repeated Mr. Cunningham, tapping the Sunday paper, in which the calamity
in question had just been announced to him.

 Ah, yes,  said Leonard, who was not going to let on that he had not
bought a Sunday paper.

 If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be
stationary in 1960. 

 You don t say so. 

 I call it a very serious thing, eh? 

 Good-evening, Mr. Cunningham. 

 Good-evening, Mr. Bast. 

Then Leonard entered Block B of the flats, and turned, not upstairs,
but down, into what is known to house agents as a semi-basement, and to
other men as a cellar. He opened the door, and cried,  Hullo!  with
the pseudo geniality of the Cockney. There was no reply.  Hullo!  he
repeated. The sitting-room was empty, though the electric light had been
left burning. A look of relief came over his face, and he flung himself
into the armchair.

The sitting-room contained, besides the armchair, two other chairs, a
piano, a three-legged table, and a cosy corner. Of the walls, one was
occupied by the window, the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling
with Cupids. Opposite the window was the door, and beside the door a
bookcase, while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of
Maud Goodman. It was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the
curtains were drawn, and the lights turned on, and the gas-stove unlit.
But it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the
dwelling-place. It had been too easily gained, and could be relinquished
too easily.

As Leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the three-legged table,
and a photograph frame, honourably poised upon it, slid sideways, fell
off into the fireplace, and smashed. He swore in a colourless sort of
way, and picked the photograph up. It represented a young lady called
Jacky, and had been taken at the time when young ladies called Jacky
were often photographed with their mouths open. Teeth of dazzling
whiteness extended along either of Jacky s jaws, and positively weighed
her head sideways, so large were they and so numerous. Take my word for
it, that smile was simply stunning, and it is only you and I who will be
fastidious, and complain that true joy begins in the eyes, and that
the eyes of Jacky did not accord with her smile, but were anxious and
hungry.

Leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass, and cut his fingers
and swore again. A drop of blood fell on the frame, another followed,
spilling over on to the exposed photograph. He swore more vigorously,
and dashed into the kitchen, where he bathed his hands. The kitchen
was the same size as the sitting-room; beyond it was a bedroom. This
completed his home. He was renting the flat furnished; of all the
objects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph
frame, the Cupids, and the books.

 Damn, damn, damnation!  he murmured, together with such other words as
he had learnt from older men. Then he raised his hand to his forehead
and said,  Oh, damn it all--  which meant something different. He pulled
himself together. He drank a little tea, black and silent, that still
survived upon an upper shelf. He swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake.
Then he went back to the sitting-room, settled himself anew, and began
to read a volume of Ruskin.

 Seven miles to the north of Venice-- 

How perfectly the famous chapter opens! How supreme its command of
admonition and of poetry! The rich man is speaking to us from his
gondola.

 Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the
city rise little above low-water mark attain by degrees a higher level,
and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass, raised here and
there into shapeless mounds, and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea. 

Leonard was trying to form his style on Ruskin; he understood him to
be the greatest master of English Prose. He read forward steadily,
occasionally making a few notes.

 Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and
first (for of the shafts enough has been said already), what is very
peculiar to this church--its luminousness. 

Was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence? Could he
adapt it to the needs of daily life? Could he introduce it, with
modifications, when he next wrote a letter to his brother, the
lay-reader? For example:

 Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession, and
first (for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already),
what is very peculiar to this flat--its obscurity. 

Something told him that the modifications would not do; and that
something, had he known it, was the spirit of English Prose.  My flat is
dark as well as stuffy.  Those were the words for him.

And the voice in the gondola rolled on, piping melodiously of Effort
and Self-Sacrifice, full of high purpose, full of beauty, full even of
sympathy and the love of men, yet somehow eluding all that was actual
and insistent in Leonard s life. For it was the voice of one who had
never been dirty or hungry, and had not guessed successfully what dirt
and hunger are.

Leonard listened to it with reverence. He felt that he was being done
good to, and that if he kept on with Ruskin, and the Queen s Hall
Concerts, and some pictures by Watts, he would one day push his head
out of the grey waters and see the universe. He believed in sudden
conversion, a belief which may be right, but which is peculiarly
attractive to a half-baked mind. It is the basis of much popular
religion; in the domain of business it dominates the Stock Exchange,
and becomes that  bit of luck  by which all successes and failures are
explained.  If only I had a bit of luck, the whole thing would come
straight... He s got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20
h.p. Fiat, but then, mind you, he s had luck... I m sorry the wife s
so late, but she never has any luck over catching trains.  Leonard
was superior to these people; he did believe in effort and in a steady
preparation for the change that he desired. But of a heritage that may
expand gradually, he had no conception; he hoped to come to Culture
suddenly, much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus. Those Miss
Schlegels had come to it; they had done the trick; their hands were upon
the ropes, once and for all. And meanwhile, his flat was dark, as well
as stuffy.

Presently there was a noise on the staircase. He shut up Margaret s card
in the pages of Ruskin, and opened the door. A woman entered, of whom
it is simplest to say that she was not respectable. Her appearance was
awesome. She seemed all strings and bell-pulls--ribbons, chains, bead
necklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round
her neck, with the ends uneven. Her throat was bare, wound with a double
row of pearls, her arms were bare to the elbows, and might again
be detected at the shoulder, through cheap lace. Her hat, which was
flowery, resembled those punnets, covered with flannel, which we sowed
with mustard and cress in our childhood, and which germinated here yes,
and there no. She wore it on the back of her head. As for her hair, or
rather hairs, they are too complicated to describe, but one system went
down her back, lying in a thick pad there, while another, created for
a lighter destiny, rippled around her forehead. The face--the face does
not signify. It was the face of the photograph, but older, and the teeth
were not so numerous as the photographer had suggested, and certainly
not so white. Yes, Jacky was past her prime, whatever that prime
may have been. She was descending quicker than most women into the
colourless years, and the look in her eyes confessed it.

 What ho!  said Leonard, greeting the apparition with much spirit, and
helping it off with its boa.

Jacky, in husky tones, replied,  What ho! 

 Been out?  he asked. The question sounds superfluous, but it cannot
have been really, for the lady answered,  No,  adding,  Oh, I am so
tired. 

 You tired? 

 Eh? 

 I m tired,  said he, hanging the boa up.

 Oh, Len, I am so tired. 

 I ve been to that classical concert I told you about,  said Leonard.

 What s that? 

 I came back as soon as it was over. 

 Any one been round to our place?  asked Jacky.

 Not that I ve seen. I met Mr. Cunningham outside, and we passed a few
remarks. 

 What, not Mr. Cunningham? 

 Yes. 

 Oh, you mean Mr. Cunningham. 

 Yes. Mr. Cunningham. 

 I ve been out to tea at a lady friend s. 

Her secret being at last given--to the world, and the name of the lady
friend being even adumbrated, Jacky made no further experiments in the
difficult and tiring art of conversation. She never had been a great
talker. Even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and
her figure to attract, and now that she was

       On the shelf,
       On the shelf,
       Boys, boys, I m on the shelf, 

she was not likely to find her tongue. Occasional bursts of song (of
which the above is an example) still issued from her lips, but the
spoken word was rare.

She sat down on Leonard s knee, and began to fondle him. She was now a
massive woman of thirty-three, and her weight hurt him, but he could not
very well say anything. Then she said,  Is that a book you re reading? 
 and he said,  That s a book,  and drew it from her unreluctant grasp.
Margaret s card fell out of it. It fell face downwards, and he murmured,
 Bookmarker. 

 Len-- 

 What is it?  he asked, a little wearily, for she only had one topic of
conversation when she sat upon his knee.

 You do love me? 

 Jacky, you know that I do. How can you ask such questions! 

 But you do love me, Len, don t you? 

 Of course I do. 

A pause. The other remark was still due.

 Len-- 

 Well? What is it? 

 Len, you will make it all right? 

 I can t have you ask me that again,  said the boy, flaring up into a
sudden passion.  I ve promised to marry you when I m of age, and that s
enough. My word s my word. I ve promised to marry you as soon as ever
I m twenty-one, and I can t keep on being worried. I ve worries enough.
It isn t likely I d throw you over, let alone my word, when I ve spent
all this money. Besides, I m an Englishman, and I never go back on my
word. Jacky, do be reasonable. Of course I ll marry you. Only do stop
badgering me. 

 When s your birthday, Len? 

 I ve told you again and again, the eleventh of November next. Now get
off my knee a bit; some one must get supper, I suppose. 

Jacky went through to the bedroom, and began to see to her hat. This
meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs. Leonard tidied up the
sitting-room, and began to prepare their evening meal. He put a penny
into the slot of the gas-meter, and soon the flat was reeking with
metallic fumes. Somehow he could not recover his temper, and all the
time he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly.

 It really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted. It makes one feel so
wild, when I ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife--all
right, all right, you SHALL be my wife--and I ve bought you the ring to
wear, and I ve taken this flat furnished, and it s far more than I can
afford, and yet you aren t content, and I ve also not told the truth
when I ve written home.  He lowered his voice.  He d stop it.  In a tone
of horror, that was a little luxurious, he repeated:  My brother d stop
it. I m going against the whole world, Jacky.

 That s what I am, Jacky. I don t take any heed of what any one says. I
just go straight forward, I do. That s always been my way. I m not one
of your weak knock-kneed chaps. If a woman s in trouble, I don t leave
her in the lurch. That s not my street. No, thank you.

 I ll tell you another thing too. I care a good deal about improving
myself by means of Literature and Art, and so getting a wider outlook.
For instance, when you came in I was reading Ruskin s Stones of Venice.
I don t say this to boast, but just to show you the kind of man I am. I
can tell you, I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon. 

To all his moods Jacky remained equally indifferent. When supper was
ready--and not before--she emerged from the bedroom, saying:  But you do
love me, don t you? 

They began with a soup square, which Leonard had just dissolved in some
hot water. It was followed by the tongue--a freckled cylinder of meat,
with a little jelly at the top, and a great deal of yellow fat at
the bottom--ending with another square dissolved in water (jelly:
pineapple), which Leonard had prepared earlier in the day. Jacky ate
contentedly enough, occasionally looking at her man with those anxious
eyes, to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded, and which
yet seemed to mirror her soul. And Leonard managed to convince his
stomach that it was having a nourishing meal.

After supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements.
She observed that her  likeness  had been broken. He found occasion to
remark, for the second time, that he had come straight back home after
the concert at Queen s Hall. Presently she sat upon his knee. The
inhabitants of Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the window,
just on a level with their heads, and the family in the flat on the
ground-floor began to sing,  Hark, my soul, it is the Lord. 

 That tune fairly gives me the hump,  said Leonard.

Jacky followed this, and said that, for her part, she thought it a
lovely tune.

 No; I ll play you something lovely. Get up, dear, for a minute. 

He went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg. He played badly and
vulgarly, but the performance was not without its effect, for Jacky
said she thought she d be going to bed. As she receded, a new set of
interests possessed the boy, and he began to think of what had been said
about music by that odd Miss Schlegel--the one that twisted her face
about so when she spoke. Then the thoughts grew sad and envious. There
was the girl named Helen, who had pinched his umbrella, and the German
girl who had smiled at him pleasantly, and Herr some one, and Aunt some
one, and the brother--all, all with their hands on the ropes. They had
all passed up that narrow, rich staircase at Wickham Place to some ample
room, whither he could never follow them, not if he read for ten hours
a day. Oh, it was no good, this continual aspiration. Some are born
cultured; the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy. To see life
steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him.

From the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called,  Len? 

 You in bed?  he asked, his forehead twitching.

 All right. 

Presently she called him again.

 I must clean my boots ready for the morning,  he answered.

Presently she called him again.

 I rather want to get this chapter done. 

 What? 

He closed his ears against her.

 What s that? 

 All right, Jacky, nothing; I m reading a book. 

 What? 

 What?  he answered, catching her degraded deafness.

Presently she called him again.

Ruskin had visited Torcello by this time, and was ordering his
gondoliers to take him to Murano. It occurred to him, as he glided over
the whispering lagoons, that the power of Nature could not be shortened
by the folly, nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such
as Leonard.

",we are not concerned with the very poor  they are unthinkable and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet  this story deals with gentlefolk  or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk   the boy  leonard bast  stood at the extreme verge of gentility  he was not in the abyss  but he could see it  and at times people whom he knew had dropped in  and counted no more  he knew that he was poor  and would admit it  he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich  this may be splendid of him  but he was inferior to most rich people  there is not the least doubt of it  he was not as courteous as the average rich man  nor as intelligent  nor as healthy  nor as lovable  his mind and his body had been alike underfed  because he was poor  and because he was modern they were always craving better food  had he lived some centuries ago  in the brightly coloured civilisations of the past  he would have had a definite status  his rank and his income would have corresponded  but in his day the angel of democracy had arisen  enshadowing the classes with leathern wings  and proclaiming   all men are equal  all men  that is to say  who possess umbrellas   and so he was obliged to assert gentility  lest he slip into the abyss where nothing counts  and the statements of democracy are inaudible   as he walked away from wickham place  his first care was to prove that he was as good as the miss schlegels  obscurely wounded in his pride  he tried to wound them in return  they were probably not ladies  would real ladies have asked him to tea  they were certainly ill natured and cold  at each step his feeling of superiority increased  would a real lady have talked about stealing an umbrella  perhaps they were thieves after all  and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a chloroformed handkerchief over his face  he walked on complacently as far as the houses of parliament  there an empty stomach asserted itself  and told him that he was a fool    evening  mr  bast     evening  mr  dealtry     nice evening     evening    mr  dealtry  a fellow clerk  passed on  and leonard stood wondering whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him  or whether he would walk  he decided to walk  it is no good giving in  and he had spent money enough at queen s hall  and he walked over westminster bridge  in front of st  thomas s hospital  and through the immense tunnel that passes under the south western main line at vauxhall  in the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the trains  a sharp pain darted through his head  and he was conscious of the exact form of his eye sockets  he pushed on for another mile  and did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called camelia road which was at present his home   here he stopped again  and glanced suspiciously to right and left  like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole  a block of flats  constructed with extreme cheapness  towered on either hand  farther down the road two more blocks were being built  and beyond these an old house was being demolished to accommodate another pair  it was the kind of scene that may be observed all over london  whatever the locality  bricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of the water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her soil  camelia road would soon stand out like a fortress  and command  for a little  an extensive view  only for a little  plans were out for the erection of flats in magnolia road also  and again a few years  and all the flats in either road might be pulled down  and new buildings  of a vastness at present unimaginable  might arise where they had fallen    evening  mr  bast     evening  mr  cunningham     very serious thing this decline of the birth rate in manchester     i beg your pardon     very serious thing this decline of the birth rate in manchester    repeated mr  cunningham  tapping the sunday paper  in which the calamity in question had just been announced to him    ah  yes   said leonard  who was not going to let on that he had not bought a sunday paper    if this kind of thing goes on the population of england will be stationary in       you don t say so     i call it a very serious thing  eh     good evening  mr  cunningham     good evening  mr  bast    then leonard entered block b of the flats  and turned  not upstairs  but down  into what is known to house agents as a semi basement  and to other men as a cellar  he opened the door  and cried   hullo   with the pseudo geniality of the cockney  there was no reply   hullo   he repeated  the sitting room was empty  though the electric light had been left burning  a look of relief came over his face  and he flung himself into the armchair   the sitting room contained  besides the armchair  two other chairs  a piano  a three legged table  and a cosy corner  of the walls  one was occupied by the window  the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with cupids  opposite the window was the door  and beside the door a bookcase  while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of maud goodman  it was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the curtains were drawn  and the lights turned on  and the gas stove unlit  but it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the dwelling place  it had been too easily gained  and could be relinquished too easily   as leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the three legged table  and a photograph frame  honourably poised upon it  slid sideways  fell off into the fireplace  and smashed  he swore in a colourless sort of way  and picked the photograph up  it represented a young lady called jacky  and had been taken at the time when young ladies called jacky were often photographed with their mouths open  teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along either of jacky s jaws  and positively weighed her head sideways  so large were they and so numerous  take my word for it  that smile was simply stunning  and it is only you and i who will be fastidious  and complain that true joy begins in the eyes  and that the eyes of jacky did not accord with her smile  but were anxious and hungry   leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass  and cut his fingers and swore again  a drop of blood fell on the frame  another followed  spilling over on to the exposed photograph  he swore more vigorously  and dashed into the kitchen  where he bathed his hands  the kitchen was the same size as the sitting room  beyond it was a bedroom  this completed his home  he was renting the flat furnished  of all the objects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph frame  the cupids  and the books    damn  damn  damnation   he murmured  together with such other words as he had learnt from older men  then he raised his hand to his forehead and said   oh  damn it all    which meant something different  he pulled himself together  he drank a little tea  black and silent  that still survived upon an upper shelf  he swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake  then he went back to the sitting room  settled himself anew  and began to read a volume of ruskin    seven miles to the north of venice     how perfectly the famous chapter opens  how supreme its command of admonition and of poetry  the rich man is speaking to us from his gondola    seven miles to the north of venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low water mark attain by degrees a higher level  and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass  raised here and there into shapeless mounds  and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea    leonard was trying to form his style on ruskin  he understood him to be the greatest master of english prose  he read forward steadily  occasionally making a few notes    let us consider a little each of these characters in succession  and first  for of the shafts enough has been said already   what is very peculiar to this church  its luminousness    was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence  could he adapt it to the needs of daily life  could he introduce it  with modifications  when he next wrote a letter to his brother  the lay reader  for example    let us consider a little each of these characters in succession  and first  for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already   what is very peculiar to this flat  its obscurity    something told him that the modifications would not do  and that something  had he known it  was the spirit of english prose   my flat is dark as well as stuffy   those were the words for him   and the voice in the gondola rolled on  piping melodiously of effort and self sacrifice  full of high purpose  full of beauty  full even of sympathy and the love of men  yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in leonard s life  for it was the voice of one who had never been dirty or hungry  and had not guessed successfully what dirt and hunger are   leonard listened to it with reverence  he felt that he was being done good to  and that if he kept on with ruskin  and the queen s hall concerts  and some pictures by watts  he would one day push his head out of the grey waters and see the universe  he believed in sudden conversion  a belief which may be right  but which is peculiarly attractive to a half baked mind  it is the basis of much popular religion  in the domain of business it dominates the stock exchange  and becomes that  bit of luck  by which all successes and failures are explained   if only i had a bit of luck  the whole thing would come straight    he s got a most magnificent place down at streatham and a   h p  fiat  but then  mind you  he s had luck    i m sorry the wife s so late  but she never has any luck over catching trains   leonard was superior to these people  he did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired  but of a heritage that may expand gradually  he had no conception  he hoped to come to culture suddenly  much as the revivalist hopes to come to jesus  those miss schlegels had come to it  they had done the trick  their hands were upon the ropes  once and for all  and meanwhile  his flat was dark  as well as stuffy   presently there was a noise on the staircase  he shut up margaret s card in the pages of ruskin  and opened the door  a woman entered  of whom it is simplest to say that she was not respectable  her appearance was awesome  she seemed all strings and bell pulls  ribbons  chains  bead necklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round her neck  with the ends uneven  her throat was bare  wound with a double row of pearls  her arms

6,6,1243,1339,1435,"

 Oh, Margaret,  cried her aunt next morning,  such a most unfortunate
thing has happened. I could not get you alone. 

The most unfortunate thing was not very serious. One of the flats in
the ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the Wilcox family,
 coming up, no doubt, in the hope of getting into London society. 
 That Mrs. Munt should be the first to discover the misfortune was not
remarkable, for she was so interested in the flats, that she watched
their every mutation with unwearying care. In theory she despised
them--they took away that old-world look--they cut off the sun--flats
house a flashy type of person. But if the truth had been known, she
found her visits to Wickham Place twice as amusing since Wickham
Mansions had arisen, and would in a couple of days learn more about
them than her nieces in a couple of months, or her nephew in a couple
of years. She would stroll across and make friends with the porters, and
inquire what the rents were, exclaiming for example:  What! a hundred
and twenty for a basement? You ll never get it!  And they would answer:
 One can but try, madam.  The passenger lifts, the arrangement for coals
(a great temptation for a dishonest porter), were all familiar matters
to her, and perhaps a relief from the politico-economical-esthetic
atmosphere that reigned at the Schlegels.

Margaret received the information calmly, and did not agree that it
would throw a cloud over poor Helen s life.

 Oh, but Helen isn t a girl with no interests,  she explained.  She has
plenty of other things and other people to think about. She made a false
start with the Wilcoxes, and she ll be as willing as we are to have
nothing more to do with them. 

 For a clever girl, dear, how very oddly you do talk. Helen ll HAVE to
have something more to do with them, now that they re all opposite. She
may meet that Paul in the street. She cannot very well not bow. 

 Of course she must bow. But look here; let s do the flowers. I was
going to say, the will to be interested in him has died, and what else
matters? I look on that disastrous episode (over which you were so
kind) as the killing of a nerve in Helen. It s dead, and she ll never be
troubled with it again. The only things that matter are the things
that interest one. Bowing, even calling and leaving cards, even a
dinner-party--we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes, if they find
it agreeable; but the other thing, the one important thing--never again.
Don t you see? 

Mrs. Munt did not see, and indeed Margaret was making a most
questionable statement--that any emotion, any interest once vividly
aroused, can wholly die.

 I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with
us. I didn t tell you at the time--it might have made you angry, and you
had enough to worry you--but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W, and apologised
for the trouble that Helen had given them. She didn t answer it. 

 How very rude! 

 I wonder. Or was it sensible? 

 No, Margaret, most rude. 

 In either case one can class it as reassuring. 

Mrs. Munt sighed. She was going back to Swanage on the morrow, just as
her nieces were wanting her most. Other regrets crowded upon her: for
instance, how magnificently she would have cut Charles if she had met
him face to face. She had already seen him, giving an order to the
porter--and very common he looked in a tall hat. But unfortunately his
back was turned to her, and though she had cut his back, she could not
regard this as a telling snub.

 But you will be careful, won t you?  she exhorted.

 Oh, certainly. Fiendishly careful. 

 And Helen must be careful, too. 

 Careful over what?  cried Helen, at that moment coming into the room
with her cousin.

 Nothing  said Margaret, seized with a momentary awkwardness.

 Careful over what, Aunt Juley? 

Mrs. Munt assumed a cryptic air.  It is only that a certain family,
whom we know by name but do not mention, as you said yourself last
night after the concert, have taken the flat opposite from the
Mathesons--where the plants are in the balcony. 

Helen began some laughing reply, and then disconcerted them all by
blushing. Mrs. Munt was so disconcerted that she exclaimed,  What,
Helen, you don t mind them coming, do you?  and deepened the blush to
crimson.

 Of course I don t mind,  said Helen a little crossly.  It is that you
and Meg are both so absurdly grave about it, when there s nothing to be
grave about at all. 

 I m not grave,  protested Margaret, a little cross in her turn.

 Well, you look grave; doesn t she, Frieda? 

 I don t feel grave, that s all I can say; you re going quite on the
wrong tack. 

 No, she does not feel grave,  echoed Mrs. Munt.  I can bear witness to
that. She disagrees-- 

 Hark!  interrupted Fraulein Mosebach.  I hear Bruno entering the hall. 

For Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place to call for the two younger
girls. He was not entering the hall--in fact, he did not enter it for
quite five minutes. But Frieda detected a delicate situation, and said
that she and Helen had much better wait for Bruno down below, and
leave Margaret and Mrs. Munt to finish arranging the flowers. Helen
acquiesced. But, as if to prove that the situation was not delicate
really, she stopped in the doorway and said:

 Did you say the Mathesons  flat, Aunt Juley? How wonderful you are!
I never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was
Matheson. 

 Come, Helen,  said her cousin.

 Go, Helen,  said her aunt; and continued to Margaret almost in the same
breath:  Helen cannot deceive me. She does mind. 

 Oh, hush!  breathed Margaret.  Frieda ll hear you, and she can be so
tiresome. 

 She minds,  persisted Mrs. Munt, moving thoughtfully about the room,
and pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases.  I knew she d
mind--and I m sure a girl ought to! Such an experience! Such awful
coarse-grained people! I know more about them than you do, which you
forget, and if Charles had taken you that motor drive--well, you d have
reached the house a perfect wreck. Oh, Margaret, you don t know what
you are in for! They re all bottled up against the drawing-room window.
There s Mrs. Wilcox--I ve seen her. There s Paul. There s Evie, who is a
minx. There s Charles--I saw him to start with. And who would an elderly
man with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be? 

 Mr. Wilcox, possibly. 

 I knew it. And there s Mr. Wilcox. 

 It s a shame to call his face copper colour,  complained Margaret.  He
has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age. 

Mrs. Munt, triumphant elsewhere, could afford to concede Mr. Wilcox
his complexion. She passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her
nieces should pursue in the future. Margaret tried to stop her.

 Helen did not take the news quite as I expected, but the Wilcox nerve
is dead in her really, so there s no need for plans. 

 It s as well to be prepared. 

 No--it s as well not to be prepared. 

 Why? 

 Because-- 

Her thought drew being from the obscure borderland. She could not
explain in so many words, but she felt that those who prepare for all
the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the
expense of joy. It is necessary to prepare for an examination, or
a dinner-party, or a possible fall in the price of stock: those who
attempt human relations must adopt another method, or fail.  Because I d
sooner risk it,  was her lame conclusion.

 But imagine the evenings,  exclaimed her aunt, pointing to the Mansions
with the spout of the watering can.  Turn the electric light on here
or there, and it s almost the same room. One evening they may forget to
draw their blinds down, and you ll see them; and the next, you yours,
and they ll see you. Impossible to sit out on the balconies. Impossible
to water the plants, or even speak. Imagine going out of the front-door,
and they come out opposite at the same moment. And yet you tell me that
plans are unnecessary, and you d rather risk it. 

 I hope to risk things all my life. 

 Oh, Margaret, most dangerous. 

 But after all,  she continued with a smile,  there s never any great
risk as long as you have money. 

 Oh, shame! What a shocking speech! 

 Money pads the edges of things,  said Miss Schlegel.  God help those
who have none. 

 But this is something quite new!  said Mrs. Munt, who collected new
ideas as a squirrel collects nuts, and was especially attracted by those
that are portable.

 New for me; sensible people have acknowledged it for years. You and I
and the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands. It is so firm beneath
our feet that we forget its very existence. It s only when we see some
one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income
means. Last night, when we were talking up here round the fire, I began
to think that the very soul of the world is economic, and that the
lowest abyss is not the absence of love, but the absence of coin. 

 I call that rather cynical. 

 So do I. But Helen and I, we ought to remember, when we are tempted to
criticise others, that we are standing on these islands, and that most
of the others are down below the surface of the sea. The poor cannot
always reach those whom they want to love, and they can hardly ever
escape from those whom they love no longer. We rich can. Imagine the
tragedy last June, if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor people, and
couldn t invoke railways and motor-cars to part them. 

 That s more like Socialism,  said Mrs. Munt suspiciously.

 Call it what you like. I call it going through life with one s hand
spread open on the table. I m tired of these rich people who pretend
to be poor, and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money
that keep their feet above the waves. I stand each year upon six hundred
pounds, and Helen upon the same, and Tibby will stand upon eight, and as
fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed--from
the sea, yes, from the sea. And all our thoughts are the thoughts of
six-hundred-pounders, and all our speeches; and because we don t want to
steal umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below the sea people do want
to steal them and do steal them sometimes, and that what s a joke up
here is down there reality. 

 There they go--there goes Fraulein Mosebach. Really, for a German she
does dress charmingly. Oh!-- 

 What is it? 

 Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes  flat. 

 Why shouldn t she? 

 I beg your pardon, I interrupted you. What was it you were saying about
reality? 

 I had worked round to myself, as usual,  answered Margaret in tones
that were suddenly preoccupied.

 Do tell me this, at all events. Are you for the rich or for the poor? 

 Too difficult. Ask me another. Am I for poverty or for riches? For
riches. Hurrah for riches! 

 For riches!  echoed Mrs. Munt, having, as it were, at last secured her
nut.

 Yes. For riches. Money for ever! 

 So am I, and so, I am afraid, are most of my acquaintances at Swanage,
but I am surprised that you agree with us. 

 Thank you so much, Aunt Juley. While I have talked theories, you have
done the flowers. 

 Not at all, dear. I wish you would let me help you in more important
things. 

 Well, would you be very kind? Would you come round with me to the
registry office? There s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say
no. 

On their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes  flat. Evie was
in the balcony,  staring most rudely,  according to Mrs. Munt. Oh yes,
it was a nuisance, there was no doubt of it. Helen was proof against
a passing encounter, but--Margaret began to lose confidence. Might it
reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her
eyes? And Frieda Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight,
and Frieda was sharp, abominably sharp, and quite capable of remarking,
 You love one of the young gentlemen opposite, yes?  The remark would be
untrue, but of the kind which, if stated often enough, may become true;
just as the remark,  England and Germany are bound to fight,  renders
war a little more likely each time that it is made, and is therefore
made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation. Have the
private emotions also their gutter press? Margaret thought so, and
feared that good Aunt Juley and Frieda were typical specimens of it.
They might, by continual chatter, lead Helen into a repetition of the
desires of June. Into a repetition--they could not do more; they
could not lead her into lasting love. They were--she saw it
clearly--Journalism; her father, with all his defects and
wrong-headedness, had been Literature, and had he lived, he would have
persuaded his daughter rightly.

The registry office was holding its morning reception. A string of
carriages filled the street. Miss Schlegel waited her turn, and finally
had to be content with an insidious  temporary,  being rejected by
genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs. Her failure
depressed her, and though she forgot the failure, the depression
remained. On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes  flat,
and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to Helen.

 Helen, you must tell me whether this thing worries you. 

 If what?  said Helen, who was washing her hands for lunch.

 The Ws  coming. 

 No, of course not. 

 Really? 

 Really.  Then she admitted that she was a little worried on Mrs.
Wilcox s account; she implied that Mrs. Wilcox might reach backward
into deep feelings, and be pained by things that never touched the other
members of that clan.  I shan t mind if Paul points at our house and
says,  There lives the girl who tried to catch me.  But she might. 

 If even that worries you, we could arrange something. There s no reason
we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease, thanks
to our money. We might even go away for a little. 

 Well, I am going away. Frieda s just asked me to Stettin, and I shan t
be back till after the New Year. Will that do? Or must I fly the country
altogether? Really, Meg, what has come over you to make such a fuss? 

 Oh, I m getting an old maid, I suppose. I thought I minded nothing, but
really I--I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice
and --she cleared her throat-- you did go red, you know, when Aunt Juley
attacked you this morning. I shouldn t have referred to it otherwise. 

But Helen s laugh rang true, as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and
swore that never, nowhere and nohow, would she again fall in love with
any of the Wilcox family, down to its remotest collaterals.

The friendship between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which was to develop
so quickly and with such strange results, may perhaps have had its
beginnings at Speyer, in the spring. Perhaps the elder lady, as she
gazed at the vulgar, ruddy cathedral, and listened to the talk of her
husband and Helen, may have detected in the other and less charming of
the sisters a deeper sympathy, a sounder judgment. She was capable
of detecting such things. Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss
Schlegels to be invited to Howards End, and Margaret whose presence she
had particularly desired. All this is speculation; Mrs. Wilcox has left
few clear indications behind her. It is certain that she came to call at
Wickham Place a fortnight later, the very day that Helen was going with
her cousin to Stettin.

 Helen!  cried Fraulein Mosebach in awestruck tones (she was now in
her cousin s confidence)-- his mother has forgiven you!  And then,
remembering that in England the new-comer ought not to call before she
is called upon, she changed her tone from awe to disapproval, and opined
that Mrs. Wilcox was keine Dame.

 Bother the whole family!  snapped Margaret.  Helen, stop giggling and
pirouetting, and go and finish your packing. Why can t the woman leave
us alone? 

 I don t know what I shall do with Meg,  Helen retorted, collapsing upon
the stairs.  She s got Wilcox and Box upon the brain. Meg, Meg, I don t
love the young gentleman; I don t love the young gentleman, Meg, Meg.
Can a body speak plainer? 

 Most certainly her love has died,  asserted Fraulein Mosebach.

 Most certainly it has, Frieda, but that will not prevent me from being
bored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call. 

Then Helen simulated tears, and Fraulein Mosebach, who thought her
extremely amusing, did the same.  Oh, boo hoo! boo hoo hoo! Meg s
going to return the call, and I can t.  Cos why?  Cos I m going to
German-eye. 

 If you are going to Germany, go and pack; if you aren t, go and call on
the Wilcoxes instead of me. 

 But, Meg, Meg, I don t love the young gentleman; I don t love the
young--O lud, who s that coming down the stairs? I vow  tis my brother.
O crimini! 

A male--even such a male as Tibby--was enough to stop the foolery. The
barrier of sex, though decreasing among the civilised, is still high,
and higher on the side of women. Helen could tell her sister all, and
her cousin much about Paul; she told her brother nothing. It was not
prudishness, for she now spoke of  the Wilcox ideal  with laughter, and
even with a growing brutality. Nor was it precaution, for Tibby seldom
repeated any news that did not concern himself. It was rather the
feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men, and that,
however trivial it was on this side of the barrier, it would become
important on that. So she stopped, or rather began to fool on other
subjects, until her long-suffering relatives drove her upstairs.
Fraulein Mosebach followed her, but lingered to say heavily over the
banisters to Margaret,  It is all right--she does not love the young
man--he has not been worthy of her. 

 Yes, I know; thanks very much. 

 I thought I did right to tell you. 

 Ever so many thanks. 

 What s that?  asked Tibby. No one told him, and he proceeded into the
dining-room, to eat plums.

That evening Margaret took decisive action. The house was very quiet,
and the fog--we are in November now--pressed against the windows like an
excluded ghost. Frieda and Helen and all their luggages had gone. Tibby,
who was not feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the fire. Margaret
sat by him, thinking. Her mind darted from impulse to impulse, and
finally marshalled them all in review. The practical person, who knows
what he wants at once, and generally knows nothing else, will accuse her
of indecision. But this was the way her mind worked. And when she did
act, no one could accuse her of indecision then. She hit out as lustily
as if she had not considered the matter at all. The letter that she
wrote Mrs. Wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution. The pale
cast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish, a breath
that leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away.

 DEAR MRS. WILCOX,

 I have to write something discourteous. It would be better if we did
not meet. Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your
family, and, in my sister s case, the grounds for displeasure might
recur. So far as I know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your
son. But it would not be fair, either to her or to you, if they met, and
it is therefore right that our acquaintance, which began so pleasantly,
should end.

 I fear that you will not agree with this; indeed, I know that you
will not, since you have been good enough to call on us. It is only
an instinct on my part, and no doubt the instinct is wrong. My sister
would, undoubtedly, say that it is wrong. I write without her knowledge,
and I hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy.

 Believe me,

 Yours truly,

 M. J. SCHLEGEL. 

Margaret sent this letter round by the post. Next morning she received
the following reply by hand:

 DEAR MISS SCHLEGEL,

 You should not have written me such a letter. I called to tell you that
Paul has gone abroad.

 RUTH WILCOX. 

Margaret s cheeks burnt. She could not finish her breakfast. She was on
fire with shame. Helen had told her that the youth was leaving England,
but other things had seemed more important, and she had forgotten. All
her absurd anxieties fell to the ground, and in their place arose the
certainty that she had been rude to Mrs. Wilcox. Rudeness affected
Margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth. It poisoned life. At times it
is necessary, but woe to those who employ it without due need. She flung
on a hat and shawl, just like a poor woman, and plunged into the fog,
which still continued. Her lips were compressed, the letter remained in
her hand, and in this state she crossed the street, entered the marble
vestibule of the flats, eluded the concierges, and ran up the stairs
till she reached the second floor. She sent in her name, and to her
surprise was shown straight into Mrs. Wilcox s bedroom.

 Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, I have made the baddest blunder. I am more, more
ashamed and sorry than I can say. 

Mrs. Wilcox bowed gravely. She was offended, and did not pretend to the
contrary. She was sitting up in bed, writing letters on an invalid table
that spanned her knees. A breakfast tray was on another table beside
her. The light of the fire, the light from the window, and the light of
a candle-lamp, which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to
create a strange atmosphere of dissolution.

 I knew he was going to India in November, but I forgot. 

 He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria, in Africa. 

 I knew--I know. I have been too absurd all through. I am very much
ashamed. 

Mrs. Wilcox did not answer.

 I am more sorry than I can say, and I hope that you will forgive me. 

 It doesn t matter, Miss Schlegel. It is good of you to have come round
so promptly. 

 It does matter,  cried Margaret.  I have been rude to you; and my
sister is not even at home, so there was not even that excuse. 

 Indeed? 

 She has just gone to Germany. 

 She gone as well,  murmured the other.  Yes, certainly, it is quite
safe--safe, absolutely, now. 

 You ve been worrying too!  exclaimed Margaret, getting more and
more excited, and taking a chair without invitation.  How perfectly
extraordinary! I can see that you have. You felt as I do; Helen mustn t
meet him again. 

 I did think it best. 

 Now why? 

 That s a most difficult question,  said Mrs. Wilcox, smiling, and a
little losing her expression of annoyance.  I think you put it best in
your letter--it was an instinct, which may be wrong. 

 It wasn t that your son still-- 

 Oh no; he often--my Paul is very young, you see. 

 Then what was it? 

She repeated:  An instinct which may be wrong. 

 In other words, they belong to types that can fall in love, but
couldn t live together. That s dreadfully probable. I m afraid that in
nine cases out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another. 

 These are indeed  other words,   said Mrs. Wilcox.  I had nothing so
coherent in my head. I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared
for your sister. 

 Ah, I have always been wanting to ask you. How DID you know? Helen
was so surprised when our aunt drove up, and you stepped forward and
arranged things. Did Paul tell you? 

 There is nothing to be gained by discussing that,  said Mrs. Wilcox
after a moment s pause.

 Mrs. Wilcox, were you very angry with us last June? I wrote you a
letter and you didn t answer it. 

 I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson s flat. I knew it was
opposite your house. 

 But it s all right now? 

 I think so. 

 You only think? You aren t sure? I do love these little muddles tidied
up? 

 Oh yes, I m sure,  said Mrs. Wilcox, moving with uneasiness beneath
the clothes.  I always sound uncertain over things. It is my way of
speaking. 

 That s all right, and I m sure, too. 

Here the maid came in to remove the breakfast-tray. They were
interrupted, and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal
lines.

 I must say good-bye now--you will be getting up. 

 No--please stop a little longer--I am taking a day in bed. Now and then
I do. 

 I thought of you as one of the early risers. 

 At Howards End--yes; there is nothing to get up for in London. 

 Nothing to get up for?  cried the scandalised Margaret.  When there are
all the autumn exhibitions, and Ysaye playing in the afternoon! Not to
mention people. 

 The truth is, I am a little tired. First came the wedding, and then
Paul went off, and, instead of resting yesterday, I paid a round of
calls. 

 A wedding? 

 Yes; Charles, my elder son, is married. 

 Indeed! 

 We took the flat chiefly on that account, and also that Paul could get
his African outfit. The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s, and
she most kindly offered it to us. So before the day came we were able to
make the acquaintance of Dolly s people, which we had not yet done. 

Margaret asked who Dolly s people were.

 Fussell. The father is in the Indian army--retired; the brother is in
the army. The mother is dead. 

So perhaps these were the  chinless sunburnt men  whom Helen had espied
one afternoon through the window. Margaret felt mildly interested in
the fortunes of the Wilcox family. She had acquired the habit on Helen s
account, and it still clung to her. She asked for more information
about Miss Dolly Fussell that was, and was given it in even, unemotional
tones. Mrs. Wilcox s voice, though sweet and compelling, had little
range of expression. It suggested that pictures, concerts, and people
are all of small and equal value. Only once had it quickened--when
speaking of Howards End.

 Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time. They
belong to the same club, and are both devoted to golf. Dolly plays
golf too, though I believe not so well; and they first met in a mixed
foursome. We all like her, and are very much pleased. They were married
on the 11th, a few days before Paul sailed. Charles was very anxious to
have his brother as best man, so he made a great point of having it on
the 11th. The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas, but they
were very nice about it. There is Dolly s photograph--in that double
frame. 

 Are you quite certain that I m not interrupting, Mrs. Wilcox? 

 Yes, quite. 

 Then I will stay. I m enjoying this. 

Dolly s photograph was now examined. It was signed  For dear Mims, 
 which Mrs. Wilcox interpreted as  the name she and Charles had settled
that she should call me.  Dolly looked silly, and had one of those
triangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man. She
was very pretty. From her Margaret passed to Charles, whose features
prevailed opposite. She speculated on the forces that had drawn the two
together till God parted them. She found time to hope that they would be
happy.

 They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon. 

 Lucky people! 

 I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy. 

 Doesn t he care for travelling? 

 He likes travel, but he does see through foreigners so. What he enjoys
most is a motor tour in England, and I think that would have carried the
day if the weather had not been so abominable. His father gave him a car
for a wedding present, which for the present is being stored at Howards
End. 

 I suppose you have a garage there? 

 Yes. My husband built a little one only last month, to the west of the
house, not far from the wych-elm, in what used to be the paddock for the
pony. 

The last words had an indescribable ring about them.

 Where s the pony gone?  asked Margaret after a pause.

 The pony? Oh, dead, ever so long ago. 

 The wych-elm I remember. Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree. 

 It is the finest wych-elm in Hertfordshire. Did your sister tell you
about the teeth? 

 No. 

 Oh, it might interest you. There are pigs  teeth stuck into the trunk,
about four feet from the ground. The country people put them in long
ago, and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark, it will cure
the toothache. The teeth are almost grown over now, and no one comes to
the tree. 

 I should. I love folklore and all festering superstitions. 

 Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache, if one believed
in it? 

 Of course it did. It would cure anything--once. 

 Certainly I remember cases--you see I lived at Howards End long, long
before Mr. Wilcox knew it. I was born there. 

The conversation again shifted. At the time it seemed little more than
aimless chatter. She was interested when her hostess explained that
Howards End was her own property. She was bored when too minute an
account was given of the Fussell family, of the anxieties of Charles
concerning Naples, of the movements of Mr. Wilcox and Evie, who were
motoring in Yorkshire. Margaret could not bear being bored. She grew
inattentive, played with the photograph frame, dropped it, smashed
Dolly s glass, apologised, was pardoned, cut her finger thereon,
was pitied, and finally said she must be going--there was all the
housekeeping to do, and she had to interview Tibby s riding-master.

Then the curious note was struck again.

 Good-bye, Miss Schlegel, good-bye. Thank you for coming. You have
cheered me up. 

 I m so glad! 

 I--I wonder whether you ever think about yourself? 

 I think of nothing else,  said Margaret, blushing, but letting her hand
remain in that of the invalid.

 I wonder. I wondered at Heidelberg. 

 I M sure! 

 I almost think-- 

 Yes?  asked Margaret, for there was a long pause--a pause that was
somehow akin to the flicker of the fire, the quiver of the reading-lamp
upon their hands, the white blur from the window; a pause of shifting
and eternal shadows.

 I almost think you forget you re a girl. 

Margaret was startled and a little annoyed.  I m twenty-nine,  she
remarked.  That s not so wildly girlish. 

Mrs. Wilcox smiled.

 What makes you say that? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude? 

A shake of the head.  I only meant that I am fifty-one, and that to
me both of you--Read it all in some book or other; I cannot put things
clearly. 

 Oh, I ve got it--inexperience. I m no better than Helen, you mean, and
yet I presume to advise her. 

 Yes. You have got it. Inexperience is the word. 

 Inexperience,  repeated Margaret, in serious yet buoyant tones.

 Of course, I have everything to learn--absolutely everything--just
as much as Helen. Life s very difficult and full of surprises. At all
events, I ve got as far as that. To be humble and kind, to go
straight ahead, to love people rather than pity them, to remember the
submerged--well, one can t do all these things at once, worse luck,
because they re so contradictory. It s then that proportion comes in--to
live by proportion. Don t BEGIN with proportion. Only prigs do that.
Let proportion come in as a last resource, when the better things have
failed, and a deadlock--Gracious me, I ve started preaching! 

 Indeed, you put the difficulties of life splendidly,  said Mrs. Wilcox,
withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows.  It is just what I should
have liked to say about them myself.

you ve been worrying too   exclaimed margaret  getting more and more excited  and taking a chair without invitation   how perfectly extraordinary  i can see that you have  you felt as i do  helen mustn t meet him again     i did think it best     now why     that s a most difficult question   said mrs  wilcox  smiling  and a little losing her expression of annoyance   i think you put it best in your letter  it was an instinct  which may be wrong     it wasn t that your son still      oh no  he often  my paul is very young  you see     then what was it    she repeated   an instinct which may be wrong     in other words  they belong to types that can fall in love  but couldn t live together  that s dreadfully probable  i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another     these are indeed  other words    said mrs  wilcox   i had nothing so coherent in my head  i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister     ah  i have always been wanting to ask you  how did you know  helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up  and you stepped forward and arranged things  did paul tell you     there is nothing to be gained by discussing that   said mrs  wilcox after a moment s pause    mrs  wilcox  were you very angry with us last june  i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it     i was certainly against taking mrs  matheson s flat  i knew it was opposite your house     but it s all right now     i think so     you only think  you aren t sure  i do love these little muddles tidied up     oh yes  i m sure   said mrs  wilcox  moving with uneasiness beneath the clothes   i always sound uncertain over things  it is my way of speaking     that s all right  and i m sure  too    here the maid came in to remove the breakfast tray  they were interrupted  and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal lines    i must say good bye now  you will be getting up     no  please stop a little longer  i am taking a day in bed  now and then i do     i thought of you as one of the early risers     at howards end  yes  there is nothing to get up for in london     nothing to get up for   cried the scandalised margaret   when there are all the autumn exhibitions  and ysaye playing in the afternoon  not to mention people     the truth is  i am a little tired  first came the wedding  and then paul went off  and  instead of resting yesterday  i paid a round of calls     a wedding     yes  charles  my elder son  is married     indeed     we took the flat chiefly on that account  and also that paul could get his african outfit  the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s  and she most kindly offered it to us  so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly s people  which we had not yet done    margaret asked who dolly s people were    fussell  the father is in the indian army  retired  the brother is in the army  the mother is dead    so perhaps these were the  chinless sunburnt men  whom helen had espied one afternoon through the window  margaret felt mildly interested in the fortunes of the wilcox family  she had acquired the habit on helen s account  and it still clung to her  she asked for more information about miss dolly fussell that was  and was given it in even  unemotional tones  mrs  wilcox s voice  though sweet and compelling  had little range of expression  it suggested that pictures  concerts  and people are all of small and equal value  only once had it quickened  when speaking of howards end    charles and albert fussell have known one another some time  they belong to the same club  and are both devoted to golf  dolly plays golf too  though i believe not so well  and they first met in a mixed foursome  we all like her  and are very much pleased  they were married on the    a few days before paul sailed  charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man  so he made a great point of having it on the    the fussells would have preferred it after christmas  but they were very nice about it  there is dolly s photograph  in that double frame     are you quite certain that i m not interrupting  mrs  wilcox     yes  quite     then i will stay  i m enjoying this    dolly s photograph was now examined  it was signed  for dear mims    which mrs  wilcox interpreted as  the name she and charles had settled that she should call me   dolly looked silly  and had one of those triangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man  she was very pretty  from her margaret passed to charles  whose features prevailed opposite  she speculated on the forces that had drawn the two together till god parted them  she found time to hope that they would be happy    they have gone to naples for their honeymoon     lucky people     i can hardly imagine charles in italy     doesn t he care for travelling     he likes travel  but he does see through foreigners so  what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england  and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable  his father gave him a car for a wedding present  which for the present is being stored at howards end     i suppose you have a garage there     yes  my husband built a little one only last month  to the west of the house  not far from the wych elm  in what used to be the paddock for the pony    the last words had an indescribable ring about them    where s the pony gone   asked margaret after a pause    the pony  oh  dead  ever so long ago     the wych elm i remember  helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree     it is the finest wych elm in hertfordshire  did your sister tell you about the teeth     no     oh  it might interest you  there are pigs  teeth stuck into the trunk  about four feet from the ground  the country people put them in long ago  and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark  it will cure the toothache  the teeth are almost grown over now  and no one comes to the tree     i should  i love folklore and all festering superstitions     do you think that the tree really did cure toothache  if one believed in it     of course it did  it would cure anything  once     certainly i remember cases  you see i lived at howards end long  long before mr  wilcox knew it  i was born there    the conversation again shifted  at the time it seemed little more than aimless chatter  she was interested when her hostess explained that howards end was her own property  she was bored when too minute an account was given of the fussell family  of the anxieties of charles concerning naples  of the movements of mr  wilcox and evie  who were motoring in yorkshire  margaret could not bear being bored  she grew inattentive  played with the photograph frame  dropped it  smashed dolly s glass  apologised  was pardoned  cut her finger thereon  was pitied  and finally said she must be going  there was all the housekeeping to do  and she had to interview tibby s riding master   then the curious note was struck again    good bye  miss schlegel  good bye  thank you for coming  you have cheered me up     i m so glad     i  i wonder whether you ever think about yourself     i think of nothing else   said margaret  blushing  but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid    i wonder  i wondered at heidelberg     i m sure     i almost think      yes   asked margaret  for there was a long pause  a pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire  the quiver of the reading lamp upon their hands  the white blur from the window  a pause of shifting and eternal shadows    i almost think you forget you re a girl    margaret was startled and a little annoyed   i m twenty nine   she remarked   that s not so wildly girlish    mrs  wilcox smiled    what makes you say that  do you mean that i have been gauche and rude    a shake of the head   i only meant that i am fifty one  and that to me both of you  read it all in some book or other  i cannot put things clearly     oh  i ve got it  inexperience  i m no better than helen  you mean  and yet i presume to advise her     yes  you have got it  inexperience is the word     inexperience   repeated margaret  in serious yet buoyant tones    of course  i have everything to learn  absolutely everything  just as much as helen  life s very difficult and full of surprises  at all events  i ve got as far as that  to be humble and kind  to go straight ahead  to love people rather than pity them  to remember the submerged  well  one can t do all these things at once  worse luck  because they re so contradictory  it s then that proportion comes in  to live by proportion  don t begin with proportion  only prigs do that  let proportion come in as a last resource  when the better things have failed  and a deadlock  gracious me  i ve started preaching     indeed  you put the difficulties of life splendidly   said mrs  wilcox  withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows   it is just what i should have liked to say about them

8,8,1698,1761,1825,"Mrs. Wilcox cannot be accused of giving Margaret much information about
life. And Margaret, on the other hand, has made a fair show of modesty,
and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel.
She had kept house for over ten years; she had entertained, almost with
distinction; she had brought up a charming sister, and was bringing up
a brother. Surely, if experience is attainable, she had attained it. Yet
the little luncheon-party that she gave in Mrs. Wilcox s honour was not
a success. The new friend did not blend with the  one or two delightful
people  who had been asked to meet her, and the atmosphere was one of
polite bewilderment. Her tastes were simple, her knowledge of culture
slight, and she was not interested in the New English Art Club, nor in
the dividing-line between Journalism and Literature, which was started
as a conversational hare. The delightful people darted after it with
cries of joy, Margaret leading them, and not till the meal was half
over did they realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the
chase. There was no common topic. Mrs. Wilcox, whose life had been spent
in the service of husband and sons, had little to say to strangers who
had never shared it, and whose age was half her own. Clever talk alarmed
her, and withered her delicate imaginings; it was the social counterpart
of a motor-car, all jerks, and she was a wisp of hay, a flower. Twice
she deplored the weather, twice criticised the train service on the
Great Northern Railway. They vigorously assented, and rushed on, and
when she inquired whether there was any news of Helen, her hostess was
too much occupied in placing Rothenstein to answer. The question was
repeated:  hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now.  Margaret
checked herself and said,  Yes, thank you; heard on Tuesday.  But the
demon of vociferation was in her, and the next moment she was off again.

 Only on Tuesday, for they live right away at Stettin. Did you ever know
any one living at Stettin? 

 Never,  said Mrs. Wilcox gravely, while her neighbour, a young man low
down in the Education Office, began to discuss what people who lived
at Stettin ought to look like. Was there such a thing as Stettininity?
Margaret swept on.

 People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses.
At least, our cousins do, but aren t particularly rich. The town isn t
interesting, except for a clock that rolls its eyes, and the view of the
Oder, which truly is something special. Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, you would
love the Oder! The river, or rather rivers--there seem to be dozens
of them--are intense blue, and the plain they run through an intensest
green. 

 Indeed! That sounds like a most beautiful view, Miss Schlegel. 

 So say, but Helen, who will muddle things, says no, it s like music.
The course of the Oder is to be like music. It s obliged to remind her
of a symphonic poem. The part by the landing-stage is in B minor, if remember rightly, but lower down things get extremely mixed. There is a
slodgy theme in several keys at once, meaning mud-banks, and another for
the navigable canal, and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major,
pianissimo. 

 What do the overhanging warehouses make of that?  asked the man,
laughing.

 They make a great deal of it,  replied Margaret, unexpectedly rushing
off on a new track.  think it s affectation to compare the Oder to
music, and so do you, but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take
beauty seriously, which we don t, and the average Englishman doesn t,
and despises all who do. Now don t say  Germans have no taste,  or shall scream. They haven t. But--but--such a tremendous but!--they take
poetry seriously. They do take poetry seriously. 

 Is anything gained by that? 

 Yes, yes. The German is always on the lookout for beauty. He may miss
it through stupidity, or misinterpret it, but he is always asking
beauty to enter his life, and believe that in the end it will come. At
Heidelberg met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as
he repeated some mawkish poetry. So easy for me to laugh--I, who never
repeat poetry, good or bad, and cannot remember one fragment of verse
to thrill myself with. My blood boils--well, m half German, so put
it down to patriotism--when listen to the tasteful contempt of the
average islander for things Teutonic, whether they re Bocklin or my
veterinary surgeon.  Oh, Bocklin,  they say;  he strains after beauty,
he peoples Nature with gods too consciously.  Of course Bocklin strains,
because he wants something--beauty and all the other intangible gifts
that are floating about the world. So his landscapes don t come off, and
Leader s do. 

 am not sure that agree. Do you?  said he, turning to Mrs. Wilcox.

She replied:  think Miss Schlegel puts everything splendidly;  and a
chill fell on the conversation.

 Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, say something nicer than that. It s such a snub to be
told you put things splendidly. 

 do not mean it as a snub. Your last speech interested me so much.
Generally people do not seem quite to like Germany. have long wanted
to hear what is said on the other side. 

 The other side? Then you do disagree. Oh, good! Give us your side. 

 have no side. But my husband --her voice softened, the chill
increased-- has very little faith in the Continent, and our children
have all taken after him. 

 On what grounds? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form? 

Mrs. Wilcox had no idea; she paid little attention to grounds. She was
not intellectual, nor even alert, and it was odd that, all the same, she
should give the idea of greatness. Margaret, zigzagging with her friends
over Thought and Art, was conscious of a personality that transcended
their own and dwarfed their activities. There was no bitterness in Mrs.
Wilcox; there was not even criticism; she was lovable, and no ungracious
or uncharitable word had passed her lips. Yet she and daily life were
out of focus; one or the other must show blurred. And at lunch she
seemed more out of focus than usual, and nearer the line that divides
daily life from a life that may be of greater importance.

 You will admit, though, that the Continent--it seems silly to speak of
 the Continent,  but really it is all more like itself than any part of
it is like England. England is unique. Do have another jelly first. was going to say that the Continent, for good or for evil, is interested
in ideas. Its Literature and Art have what one might call the kink of
the unseen about them, and this persists even through decadence and
affectation. There is more liberty of action in England, but for liberty
of thought go to bureaucratic Prussia. People will there discuss with
humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch
with tongs. 

 do not want to go to Prussia,  said Mrs. Wilcox  not even to see
that interesting view that you were describing. And for discussing with
humility am too old. We never discuss anything at Howards End. 

 Then you ought to!  said Margaret.  Discussion keeps a house alive. It
cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone. 

 It cannot stand without them,  said Mrs. Wilcox, unexpectedly catching
on to the thought, and rousing, for the first and last time, a faint
hope in the breasts of the delightful people.  It cannot stand without
them, and sometimes think--But cannot expect your generation to
agree, for even my daughter disagrees with me here. 

 Never mind us or her. Do say! 

 sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to
men. 

There was a little silence.

 One admits that the arguments against the suffrage ARE extraordinarily
strong,  said a girl opposite, leaning forward and crumbling her bread.

 Are they? never follow any arguments. am only too thankful not to
have a vote myself. 

 We didn t mean the vote, though, did we?  supplied Margaret.  Aren t
we differing on something much wider, Mrs. Wilcox? Whether women are to
remain what they have been since the dawn of history; or whether, since
men have moved forward so far, they too may move forward a little now. say they may. would even admit a biological change. 

 don t know, don t know. 

 must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse,  said the man.
 They ve turned disgracefully strict. 

Mrs. Wilcox also rose.

 Oh, but come upstairs for a little. Miss Quested plays. Do you like
MacDowell? Do you mind his only having two noises? If you must really
go, ll see you out. Won t you even have coffee? 

They left the dining-room closing the door behind them, and as Mrs.
Wilcox buttoned up her jacket, she said:  What an interesting life you
all lead in London! 

 No, we don t,  said Margaret, with a sudden revulsion.  We lead the
lives of gibbering monkeys. Mrs. Wilcox--really--We have something quiet
and stable at the bottom. We really have. All my friends have. Don t
pretend you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it, but forgive me by coming
again, alone, or by asking me to you. 

 am used to young people,  said Mrs. Wilcox, and with each word she
spoke the outlines of known things grew dim.  hear a great deal of
chatter at home, for we, like you, entertain a great deal. With us it
is more sport and politics, but--enjoyed my lunch very much, Miss
Schlegel, dear, and am not pretending, and only wish could have joined
in more. For one thing, m not particularly well just to-day. For
another, you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me. Charles
is the same, Dolly the same. But we are all in the same boat, old and
young. never forget that. 

They were silent for a moment. Then, with a newborn emotion, they shook
hands. The conversation ceased suddenly when Margaret re-entered the
dining-room; her friends had been talking over her new friend, and had
dismissed her as uninteresting.",mrs  wilcox cannot be accused of giving margaret much information about life  and margaret  on the other hand  has made a fair show of modesty  and has pretended to an

9,9,1826,1941,2056,"Several days passed.

Was Mrs. Wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people--there are many of
them--who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it? They evoke our interests
and affections, and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them.
Then they withdraw. When physical passion is involved, there is a
definite name for such behaviour--flirting--and if carried far enough
it is punishable by law. But no law--not public opinion even--punishes
those who coquette with friendship, though the dull ache that they
inflict, the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion, may be as
intolerable. Was she one of these?

Margaret feared so at first, for, with a Londoner s impatience, she
wanted everything to be settled up immediately. She mistrusted the
periods of quiet that are essential to true growth. Desiring to book
Mrs. Wilcox as a friend, she pressed on the ceremony, pencil, as it
were, in hand, pressing the more because the rest of the family were
away, and the opportunity seemed favourable. But the elder woman would
not be hurried. She refused to fit in with the Wickham Place set, or to
reopen discussion of Helen and Paul, whom Margaret would have utilised
as a short-cut. She took her time, or perhaps let time take her, and
when the crisis did come all was ready.

The crisis opened with a message: Would Miss Schlegel come shopping?
Christmas was nearing, and Mrs. Wilcox felt behindhand with the
presents. She had taken some more days in bed, and must make up for lost
time. Margaret accepted, and at eleven o clock one cheerless morning
they started out in a brougham.

 First of all,  began Margaret,  we must make a list and tick off the
people s names. My aunt always does, and this fog may thicken up any
moment. Have you any ideas? 

 thought we would go to Harrods or the Haymarket Stores,  said Mrs.
Wilcox rather hopelessly.  Everything is sure to be there. am not a
good shopper. The din is so confusing, and your aunt is quite right--one
ought to make a list. Take my notebook, then, and write your own name at
the top of the page. 

 Oh, hooray!  said Margaret, writing it.  How very kind of you to start
with me!  But she did not want to receive anything expensive. Their
acquaintance was singular rather than intimate, and she divined that the
Wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders; the more compact
families do. She did not want to be thought a second Helen, who would
snatch presents since she could not snatch young men, nor to be exposed
like a second Aunt Juley, to the insults of Charles. A certain austerity
of demeanour was best, and she added:  don t really want a Yuletide
gift, though. In fact, d rather not. 

 Why? 

 Because ve odd ideas about Christmas. Because have all that money
can buy. want more people, but no more things. 

 should like to give you something worth your acquaintance, Miss
Schlegel, in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight.
It has so happened that have been left alone, and you have stopped me
from brooding. am too apt to brood. 

 If that is so,  said Margaret,  if have happened to be of use to you,
which didn t know, you cannot pay me back with anything tangible. 

 suppose not, but one would like to. Perhaps shall think of
something as we go about. 

Her name remained at the head of the list, but nothing was written
opposite it. They drove from shop to shop. The air was white, and when
they alighted it tasted like cold pennies. At times they passed through
a clot of grey. Mrs. Wilcox s vitality was low that morning, and it was
Margaret who decided on a horse for this little girl, a golliwog for
that, for the rector s wife a copper warming-tray.  We always give the
servants money.   Yes, do you, yes, much easier,  replied Margaret but
felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen, and saw issuing
from a forgotten manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys.
Vulgarity reigned. Public-houses, besides their usual exhortation
against temperance reform, invited men to  Join our Christmas goose
club --one bottle of gin, etc., or two, according to subscription. A
poster of a woman in tights heralded the Christmas pantomime, and little
red devils, who had come in again that year, were prevalent upon the
Christmas-cards. Margaret was no morbid idealist. She did not wish
this spate of business and self-advertisement checked. It was only the
occasion of it that struck her with amazement annually. How many of
these vacillating shoppers and tired shop-assistants realised that it
was a divine event that drew them together? She realised it, though
standing outside in the matter. She was not a Christian in the accepted
sense; she did not believe that God had ever worked among us as a young
artisan. These people, or most of them, believed it, and if pressed,
would affirm it in words. But the visible signs of their belief were
Regent Street or Drury Lane, a little mud displaced, a little money
spent, a little food cooked, eaten, and forgotten. Inadequate. But in
public who shall express the unseen adequately? It is private life that
holds out the mirror to infinity; personal intercourse, and that alone,
that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision.

 No, do like Christmas on the whole,  she announced.  In its clumsy
way, it does approach Peace and Goodwill. But oh, it is clumsier every
year. 

 Is it? am only used to country Christmases. 

 We are usually in London, and play the game with vigour--carols at
the Abbey, clumsy midday meal, clumsy dinner for the maids, followed by
Christmas-tree and dancing of poor children, with songs from Helen.
The drawing-room does very well for that. We put the tree in the
powder-closet, and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted, and with
the looking-glass behind it looks quite pretty. wish we might have
a powder-closet in our next house. Of course, the tree has to be very
small, and the presents don t hang on it. No; the presents reside in a
sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper. 

 You spoke of your  next house,  Miss Schlegel. Then are you leaving
Wickham Place? 

 Yes, in two or three years, when the lease expires. We must. 

 Have you been there long? 

 All our lives. 

 You will be very sorry to leave it. 

 suppose so. We scarcely realise it yet. My father--  She broke off,
for they had reached the stationery department of the Haymarket Stores,
and Mrs. Wilcox wanted to order some private greeting cards.

 If possible, something distinctive,  she sighed. At the counter
she found a friend, bent on the same errand, and conversed with
her insipidly, wasting much time.  My husband and our daughter are
motoring.   Bertha, too? Oh, fancy, what a coincidence! 

Margaret, though not practical, could shine in such company as this.
While they talked, she went through a volume of specimen cards,
and submitted one for Mrs. Wilcox s inspection. Mrs. Wilcox was
delighted--so original, words so sweet; she would order a hundred
like that, and could never be sufficiently grateful. Then, just as the
assistant was booking the order, she said:  Do you know, ll wait. On
second thoughts, ll wait. There s plenty of time still, isn t there,
and shall be able to get Evie s opinion. 

They returned to the carriage by devious paths; when they were in, she
said,  But couldn t you get it renewed? 

 beg your pardon?  asked Margaret.

 The lease, mean. 

 Oh, the lease! Have you been thinking of that all the time? How very
kind of you! 

 Surely something could be done. 

 No; values have risen too enormously. They mean to pull down Wickham
Place, and build flats like yours. 

 But how horrible! 

 Landlords are horrible. 

Then she said vehemently:  It is monstrous, Miss Schlegel; it isn t
right. had no idea that this was hanging over you. do pity you from
the bottom of my heart. To be parted from your house, your father s
house--it oughtn t to be allowed. It is worse than dying. would rather
die than--Oh, poor girls! Can what they call civilisation be right, if
people mayn t die in the room where they were born? My dear, am so
sorry. 

Margaret did not know what to say. Mrs. Wilcox had been overtired by the
shopping, and was inclined to hysteria.

 Howards End was nearly pulled down once. It would have killed me. 

 I--Howards End must be a very different house to ours. We are fond of
ours, but there is nothing distinctive about it. As you saw, it is an
ordinary London house. We shall easily find another. 

 So you think. 

 Again my lack of experience, suppose!  said Margaret, easing away
from the subject.  can t say anything when you take up that line, Mrs.
Wilcox. wish could see myself as you see me--foreshortened into a
backfisch. Quite the ingenue. Very charming--wonderfully well read for
my age, but incapable-- 

Mrs. Wilcox would not be deterred.  Come down with me to Howards End
now,  she said, more vehemently than ever.  want you to see it. You
have never seen it. want to hear what you say about it, for you do put
things so wonderfully. 

Margaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her
companion.  Later on should love it,  she continued,  but it s hardly
the weather for such an expedition, and we ought to start when we re
fresh. Isn t the house shut up, too? 

She received no answer. Mrs. Wilcox appeared to be annoyed.

 Might come some other day? 

Mrs. Wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass.  Back to Wickham Place,
please!  was her order to the coachman. Margaret had been snubbed.

 A thousand thanks, Miss Schlegel, for all your help. 

 Not at all. 

 It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind--the
Christmas-cards especially. do admire your choice. 

It was her turn to receive no answer. In her turn Margaret became
annoyed.

 My husband and Evie will be back the day after to-morrow. That is why
dragged you out shopping to-day. stayed in town chiefly to shop,
but got through nothing, and now he writes that they must cut their
tour short, the weather is so bad, and the police-traps have been so
bad--nearly as bad as in Surrey. Ours is such a careful chauffeur, and
my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like
road-hogs. 

 Why? 

 Well, naturally he--he isn t a road-hog. 

 He was exceeding the speed-limit, conclude. He must expect to suffer
with the lower animals. 

Mrs. Wilcox was silenced. In growing discomfort they drove homewards.
The city seemed Satanic, the narrower streets oppressing like the
galleries of a mine.

No harm was done by the fog to trade, for it lay high, and the lighted
windows of the shops were thronged with customers. It was rather a
darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself, to find a more
grievous darkness within. Margaret nearly spoke a dozen times, but
something throttled her. She felt petty and awkward, and her meditations
on Christmas grew more cynical. Peace? It may bring other gifts, but is
there a single Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful? The craving for
excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing. Goodwill? Had
she seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers? Or in herself?
She had failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a
little queer and imaginative--she, whose birthright it was to nourish
imagination! Better to have accepted, to have tired themselves a little
by the journey, than coldly to reply,  Might come some other day?  Her
cynicism left her. There would be no other day. This shadowy woman would
never ask her again.

They parted at the Mansions. Mrs. Wilcox went in after due civilities,
and Margaret watched the tall, lonely figure sweep up the hall to
the lift. As the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an
imprisonment The beautiful head disappeared first, still buried in the
muff; the long trailing skirt followed. A woman of undefinable rarity
was going up heavenward, like a specimen in a bottle. And into what a
heaven--a vault as of hell, sooty black, from which soot descended!

At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence insisted on
talking. Tibby was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove
him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long
account of the day-school that he sometimes patronised. The account was
interesting, and she had often pressed him for it before, but she
could not attend now, for her mind was focussed on the invisible. She
discerned that Mrs. Wilcox, though a loving wife and mother, had only
one passion in life--her house--and that the moment was solemn when she
invited a friend to share this passion with her. To answer  another day 
 was to answer as a fool.  Another day  will do for brick and mortar, but
not for the Holy of Holies into which Howards End had been transfigured.
Her own curiosity was slight. She had heard more than enough about it in
the summer. The nine windows, the vine, and the wych-elm had no pleasant
connections for her, and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon
at a concert. But imagination triumphed. While her brother held forth
she determined to go, at whatever cost, and to compel Mrs. Wilcox to go,
too. When lunch was over she stepped over to the flats.

Mrs. Wilcox had just gone away for the night.

Margaret said that it was of no consequence, hurried downstairs, and
took a hansom to King s Cross. She was convinced that the escapade
was important, though it would have puzzled her to say why. There was
question of imprisonment and escape, and though she did not know the
time of the train, she strained her eyes for St. Pancras s clock.

Then the clock of King s Cross swung into sight, a second moon in that
infernal sky, and her cab drew up at the station. There was a train for
Hilton in five minutes. She took a ticket, asking in her agitation for
a single. As she did so, a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked
her.

 will come if still may,  said Margaret, laughing nervously.

 You are coming to sleep, dear, too. It is in the morning that my house
is most beautiful. You are coming to stop. cannot show you my meadow
properly except at sunrise. These fogs --she pointed at the station
roof-- never spread far. dare say they are sitting in the sun in
Hertfordshire, and you will never repent joining them. 

 shall never repent joining you. 

 It is the same. 

They began the walk up the long platform. Far at its end stood the
train, breasting the darkness without. They never reached it. Before
imagination could triumph, there were cries of  Mother! mother!  and a
heavy-browed girl darted out of the cloak-room and seized Mrs. Wilcox by
the arm.

 Evie!  she gasped-- Evie, my pet-- 

The girl called,  Father! say! look who s here. 

 Evie, dearest girl, why aren t you in Yorkshire? 

 No--motor smash--changed plans--father s coming. 

 Why, Ruth!  cried Mr. Wilcox, joining them,  what in the name of all
that s wonderful are you doing here, Ruth? 

Mrs. Wilcox had recovered herself.

 Oh, Henry dear!--here s a lovely surprise--but let me introduce--but think you know Miss Schlegel. 

 Oh yes,  he replied, not greatly interested.  But how s yourself,
Ruth? 

 Fit as a fiddle,  she answered gaily.

 So are we, and so was our car, which ran A1 as far as Ripon, but there
a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver-- 

 Miss Schlegel, our little outing must be for another day. 

 was saying that this fool of a driver, as the policeman himself
admits. 

 Another day, Mrs. Wilcox. Of course. 

 --But as we ve insured against third party risks, it won t so much
matter-- 

 --Cart and car being practically at right angles-- 

The voices of the happy family rose high. Margaret was left alone.
No one wanted her. Mrs. Wilcox walked out of King s Cross between her
husband and her daughter, listening to both of them.",several days passed   was mrs  wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people  there are many of them  who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it  they

The funeral was over. The carriages had rolled away through the soft
mud, and only the poor remained. They approached to the newly-dug shaft
and looked their last at the coffin, now almost hidden beneath the
spadefuls of clay. It was their moment. Most of them were women from the
dead woman s district, to whom black garments had been served out by Mr.
Wilcox s orders. Pure curiosity had brought others. They thrilled with
the excitement of a death, and of a rapid death, and stood in groups or
moved between the graves, like drops of ink. The son of one of them, a
wood-cutter, was perched high above their heads, pollarding one of the
churchyard elms. From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton,
strung upon the North Road, with its accreting suburbs; the sunset
beyond, scarlet and orange, winking at him beneath brows of grey; the
church; the plantations; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields
and farms. But he, too, was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth.
He tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw
the coffin approaching: how he could not leave his work, and yet did not
like to go on with it; how he had almost slipped out of the tree, he was
so upset; the rooks had cawed, and no wonder--it was as if rooks knew
too. His mother claimed the prophetic power herself--she had seen
a strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time. London had done the
mischief, said others. She had been a kind lady; her grandmother had
been kind, too--a plainer person, but very kind. Ah, the old sort was
dying out! Mr. Wilcox, he was a kind gentleman. They advanced to the
topic again and again, dully, but with exaltation. The funeral of a rich
person was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to the
educated. It was Art; though remote from life, it enhanced life s
values, and they witnessed it avidly.

The grave-diggers, who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval--they
disliked Charles; it was not a moment to speak of such things, but they
did not like Charles Wilcox--the grave-diggers finished their work and
piled up the wreaths and crosses above it. The sun set over Hilton;
the grey brows of the evening flushed a little, and were cleft with
one scarlet frown. Chattering sadly to each other, the mourners passed
through the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down
to the village. The young wood-cutter stayed a little longer, poised
above the silence and swaying rhythmically. At last the bough fell
beneath his saw. With a grunt, he descended, his thoughts dwelling no
longer on death, but on love, for he was mating. He stopped as he passed
the new grave; a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye.
 They didn t ought to have coloured flowers at buryings,  he reflected.
Trudging on a few steps, he stopped again, looked furtively at the dusk,
turned back, wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf, and hid it in his
pocket.

After him came silence absolute. The cottage that abutted on the
churchyard was empty, and no other house stood near. Hour after hour
the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it. Clouds
drifted over it from the west; or the church may have been a ship,
high-prowed, steering with all its company towards infinity. Towards
morning the air grew colder, the sky clearer, the surface of the earth
hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead. The wood-cutter, returning
after a night of joy, reflected:  They lilies, they chrysants; it s a
pity I didn t take them all. 

Up at Howards End they were attempting breakfast. Charles and Evie sat
in the dining-room, with Mrs. Charles. Their father, who could not bear
to see a face, breakfasted upstairs. He suffered acutely. Pain came over
him in spasms, as if it was physical, and even while he was about to
eat, his eyes would fill with tears, and he would lay down the morsel
untasted.

He remembered his wife s even goodness during thirty years. Not anything
in detail--not courtship or early raptures--but just the unvarying
virtue, that seemed to him a woman s noblest quality. So many women are
capricious, breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity. Not so his
wife. Year after year, summer and winter, as bride and mother, she had
been the same, he had always trusted her. Her tenderness! Her innocence!
The wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of God. Ruth knew
no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her
garden, or the grass in her field. Her idea of business-- Henry, why
do people who have enough money try to get more money?  Her idea of
politics-- I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet,
there would be no more wars,  Her idea of religion--ah, this had been a
cloud, but a cloud that passed. She came of Quaker stock, and he and his
family, formerly Dissenters, were now members of the Church of England.
The rector s sermons had at first repelled her, and she had expressed a
desire for  a more inward light,  adding,  not so much for myself as for
baby  (Charles). Inward light must have been granted, for he heard no
complaints in later years. They brought up their three children without
dispute. They had never disputed.

She lay under the earth now. She had gone, and as if to make her going
the more bitter, had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike
her.  Why didn t you tell me you knew of it?  he had moaned, and her
faint voice had answered:  I didn t want to, Henry--I might have been
wrong--and every one hates illnesses.  He had been told of the horror by
a strange doctor, whom she had consulted during his absence from town.
Was this altogether just? Without fully explaining, she had died. It
was a fault on her part, and--tears rushed into his eyes--what a little
fault! It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years.

He rose to his feet and looked out of the window, for Evie had come in
with the letters, and he could meet no one s eye. Ah yes--she had been a
good woman--she had been steady. He chose the word deliberately. To him
steadiness included all praise. He himself, gazing at the wintry garden,
is in appearance a steady man. His face was not as square as his son s,
and, indeed, the chin, though firm enough in outline, retreated a
little, and the lips, ambiguous, were curtained by a moustache. But
there was no external hint of weakness. The eyes, if capable of kindness
and good-fellowship, if ruddy for the moment with tears, were the eyes
of one who could not be driven. The forehead, too, was like Charles s.
High and straight, brown and polished, merging abruptly into temples and
skull, it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the
world. At times it had the effect of a blank wall. He had dwelt behind
it, intact and happy, for fifty years.  The post s come, father,  said
Evie awkwardly.

 Thanks. Put it down. 

 Has the breakfast been all right? 

 Yes, thanks. 

The girl glanced at him and at it with constraint. She did not know what
to do.

 Charles says do you want the Times? 

 No, I ll read it later. 

 Ring if you want anything, father, won t you? 

 I ve all I want. 

Having sorted the letters from the circulars, she went back to the
dining-room.

 Father s eaten nothing,  she announced, sitting down with wrinkled
brows behind the tea-urn.

Charles did not answer, but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs,
opened the door, and said  Look here father, you must eat, you know; 
 and having paused for a reply that did not come, stole down again.  He s
going to read his letters first, I think,  he said evasively;  I dare
say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards.  Then he took up the
Times, and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup
against saucer and of knife on plate.

Poor Mrs. Charles sat between her silent companions terrified at
the course of events, and a little bored. She was a rubbishy little
creature, and she knew it. A telegram had dragged her from Naples to
the death-bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known. A word from her
husband had plunged her into mourning. She desired to mourn inwardly as
well, but she wished that Mrs. Wilcox, since fated to die, could have
died before the marriage, for then less would have been expected of her.
Crumbling her toast, and too nervous to ask for the butter, she remained
almost motionless, thankful only for this, that her father-in-law was
having his breakfast upstairs.

At last Charles spoke.  They had no business to be pollarding those elms
yesterday,  he said to his sister.

 No, indeed. 

 I must make a note of that,  he continued.  I am surprised that the
rector allowed it. 

 Perhaps it may not be the rector s affair. 

 Whose else could it be? 

 The lord of the manor. 

 Impossible. 

 Butter, Dolly? 

 Thank you, Evie dear. Charles-- 

 Yes, dear? 

 I didn t know one could pollard elms. I thought one only pollarded
willows. 

 Oh no, one can pollard elms. 

 Then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded?  Charles
frowned a little, and turned again to his sister.

 Another point. I must speak to Chalkeley. 

 Yes, rather; you must complain to Chalkeley. 

 It s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men. He is
responsible. 

 Yes, rather. 

Brother and sister were not callous. They spoke thus, partly because
they desired to keep Chalkeley up to the mark--a healthy desire in its
way--partly because they avoided the personal note in life. All Wilcoxes
did. It did not seem to them of supreme importance. Or it may be as
Helen supposed: they realised its importance, but were afraid of it.
Panic and emptiness, could one glance behind. They were not callous, and
they left the breakfast-table with aching hearts. Their mother never had
come in to breakfast. It was in the other rooms, and especially in the
garden, that they felt her loss most. As Charles went out to the garage,
he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom
he could never replace. What battles he had fought against her gentle
conservatism! How she had disliked improvements, yet how loyally she had
accepted them when made! He and his father--what trouble they had had
to get this very garage! With what difficulty had they persuaded her to
yield them the paddock for it--the paddock that she loved more dearly
than the garden itself! The vine--she had got her way about the vine. It
still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches. And so
with Evie, as she stood talking to the cook. Though she could take up
her mother s work inside the house, just as the man could take it up
without, she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life.
Their grief, though less poignant than their father s, grew from deeper
roots, for a wife may be replaced; a mother never. Charles would go
back to the office. There was little at Howards End. The contents of his
mother s will had long been known to them. There were no legacies, no
annuities, none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead
prolong their activities. Trusting her husband, she had left him
everything without reserve. She was quite a poor woman--the house had
been all her dowry, and the house would come to Charles in time. Her
watercolours Mr. Wilcox intended to reserve for Paul, while Evie would
take the jewellery and lace. How easily she slipped out of life!
Charles thought the habit laudable, though he did not intend to adopt
it himself, whereas Margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable
indifference to earthly fame. Cynicism--not the superficial cynicism
that snarls and sneers, but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and
tenderness--that was the note of Mrs. Wilcox s will. She wanted not to
vex people. That accomplished, the earth might freeze over her for ever.

No, there was nothing for Charles to wait for. He could not go on
with his honeymoon, so he would go up to London and work--he felt too
miserable hanging about. He and Dolly would have the furnished flat
while his father rested quietly in the country with Evie. He could
also keep an eye on his own little house, which was being painted and
decorated for him in one of the Surrey suburbs, and in which he hoped to
install himself soon after Christmas. Yes, he would go up after lunch in
his new motor, and the town servants, who had come down for the funeral,
would go up by train.

He found his father s chauffeur in the garage, said  Morning  without
looking at the man s face, and bending over the car, continued:  Hullo!
my new car s been driven! 

 Has it, sir? 

 Yes,  said Charles, getting rather red;  and whoever s driven it hasn t
cleaned it properly, for there s mud on the axle. Take it off. 

The man went for the cloths without a word. He was a chauffeur as ugly
as sin--not that this did him disservice with Charles, who thought charm
in a man rather rot, and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast
with whom they had started.

 Charles--  His bride was tripping after him over the hoar-frost, a
dainty black column, her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming
the capital thereof.

 One minute, I m busy. Well, Crane, who s been driving it, do you
suppose? 

 Don t know, I m sure, sir. No one s driven it since I ve been back,
but, of course, there s the fortnight I ve been away with the other car
in Yorkshire. 

The mud came off easily.

 Charles, your father s down. Something s happened. He wants you in the
house at once. Oh, Charles! 

 Wait, dear, wait a minute. Who had the key of the garage while you were
away, Crane? 

 The gardener, sir. 

 Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor? 

 No, sir; no one s had the motor out, sir. 

 Then how do you account for the mud on the axle? 

 I can t, of course, say for the time I ve been in Yorkshire. No more
mud now, sir. 

Charles was vexed. The man was treating him as a fool, and if his heart
had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father. But it
was not a morning for complaints. Ordering the motor to be round after
lunch, he joined his wife, who had all the while been pouring out some
incoherent story about a letter and a Miss Schlegel.

 Now, Dolly, I can attend to you. Miss Schlegel? What does she want? 

When people wrote a letter Charles always asked what they wanted. Want
was to him the only cause of action. And the question in this case was
correct, for his wife replied,  She wants Howards End. 

 Howards End? Now, Crane, just don t forget to put on the Stepney
wheel. 

 No, sir. 

 Now, mind you don t forget, for I--Come, little woman.  When they were
out of the chauffeur s sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed
her against him. All his affection and half his attention--it was what
he granted her throughout their happy married life.

 But you haven t listened, Charles. 

 What s wrong? 

 I keep on telling you--Howards End. Miss Schlegel s got it. 

 Got what?  said Charles, unclasping her.  What the dickens are you
talking about? 

 Now, Charles, you promised not to say those naughty-- 

 Look here, I m in no mood for foolery. It s no morning for it either. 

 I tell you--I keep on telling you--Miss Schlegel--she s got it--your
mother s left it to her--and you ve all got to move out! 

 HOWARDS END? 

 HOWARDS END!  she screamed, mimicking him, and as she did so Evie came
dashing out of the shubbery.

 Dolly, go back at once! My father s much annoyed with you.
Charles --she hit herself wildly-- come in at once to father. He s had a
letter that s too awful. 

Charles began to run, but checked himself, and stepped heavily across
the gravel path. There the house was with the nine windows, the
unprolific vine. He exclaimed,  Schlegels again!  and as if to complete
chaos, Dolly said,  Oh no, the matron of the nursing home has written
instead of her. 

 Come in, all three of you!  cried his father, no longer inert.

 Dolly, why have you disobeyed me? 

 Oh, Mr. Wilcox-- 

 I told you not to go out to the garage. I ve heard you all shouting in
the garden. I won t have it. Come in. 

He stood in the porch, transformed, letters in his hand.

 Into the dining-room, every one of you. We can t discuss private
matters in the middle of all the servants. Here, Charles, here; read
these. See what you make. 

Charles took two letters, and read them as he followed the procession.
The first was a covering note from the matron. Mrs. Wilcox had desired
her, when the funeral should be over, to forward the enclosed. The
enclosed--it was from his mother herself. She had written:  To my
husband: I should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards End. 

 I suppose we re going to have a talk about this?  he remarked,
ominously calm.

 Certainly. I was coming out to you when Dolly-- 

 Well, let s sit down. 

 Come, Evie, don t waste time, sit--down. 

In silence they drew up to the breakfast-table. The events of
yesterday--indeed, of this morning suddenly receded into a past so
remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it. Heavy breathings
were heard. They were calming themselves. Charles, to steady
them further, read the enclosure out loud:  A note in my mother s
handwriting, in an envelope addressed to my father, sealed. Inside:  I
should like Miss Schlegel (Margaret) to have Howards End.  No date, no
signature. Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home. Now, the
question is-- 

Dolly interrupted him.  But I say that note isn t legal. Houses ought to
be done by a lawyer, Charles, surely. 

Her husband worked his jaw severely. Little lumps appeared in front of
either ear--a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect, and she
asked whether she might see the note. Charles looked at his father for
permission, who said abstractedly,  Give it her.  She seized it, and
at once exclaimed:  Why, it s only in pencil! I said so. Pencil never
counts. 

 We know that it is not legally binding, Dolly,  said Mr. Wilcox,
speaking from out of his fortress.  We are aware of that. Legally, I
should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire. Of
course, my dear, we consider you as one of the family, but it will be
better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand. 

Charles, vexed both with his father and his wife, then repeated:  The
question is--  He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from plates
and knives, so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth.  The
question is whether Miss Schlegel, during the fortnight we were all
away, whether she unduly--  He stopped.

 I don t think that,  said his father, whose nature was nobler than his
son s.

 Don t think what? 

 That she would have--that it is a case of undue influence. No, to
my mind the question is the--the invalid s condition at the time she
wrote. 

 My dear father, consult an expert if you like, but I don t admit it is
my mother s writing. 

 Why, you just said it was!  cried Dolly.

 Never mind if I did,  he blazed out;  and hold your tongue. 

The poor little wife coloured at this, and, drawing her handkerchief
from her pocket, shed a few tears. No one noticed her. Evie was scowling
like an angry boy. The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the
committee-room. They were both at their best when serving on committees.
They did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk, but
disposed of them item by item, sharply. Caligraphy was the item before
them now, and on it they turned their well-trained brains. Charles,
after a little demur, accepted the writing as genuine, and they passed
on to the next point. It is the best--perhaps the only--way of dodging
emotion. They were the average human article, and had they considered
the note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad.
Considered item by item, the emotional content was minimised, and all
went forward smoothly. The clock ticked, the coals blazed higher, and
contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows.
Unnoticed, the sun occupied his sky, and the shadows of the tree stems,
extraordinarily solid, fell like trenches of purple across the frosted
lawn. It was a glorious winter morning. Evie s fox terrier, who had
passed for white, was only a dirty grey dog now, so intense was the
purity that surrounded him. He was discredited, but the blackbirds that
he was chasing glowed with Arabian darkness, for all the conventional
colouring of life had been altered. Inside, the clock struck ten with a
rich and confident note. Other clocks confirmed it, and the discussion
moved towards its close.

To follow it is unnecessary. It is rather a moment when the commentator
should step forward. Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to
Margaret? I think not. The appeal was too flimsy. It was not legal; it
had been written in illness, and under the spell of a sudden friendship;
it was contrary to the dead woman s intentions in the past, contrary to
her very nature, so far as that nature was understood by them. To them
Howards End was a house: they could not know that to her it had been
a spirit, for which she sought a spiritual heir. And--pushing one step
farther in these mists--may they not have decided even better than
they supposed? Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be
bequeathed at all? Has the soul offspring? A wych-elm tree, a vine, a
wisp of hay with dew on it--can passion for such things be transmitted
where there is no bond of blood? No; the Wilcoxes are not to be blamed.
The problem is too terrific, and they could not even perceive a problem.
No; it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear
the note up and throw it on to their dining-room fire. The practical
moralist may acquit them absolutely. He who strives to look deeper
may acquit them--almost. For one hard fact remains. They did neglect a
personal appeal. The woman who had died did say to them,  Do this,  and
they answered,  We will not. 

The incident made a most painful impression on them. Grief mounted into
the brain and worked there disquietingly. Yesterday they had lamented:
 She was a dear mother, a true wife; in our absence she neglected her
health and died.  To-day they thought:  She was not as true, as dear, as
we supposed.  The desire for a more inward light had found expression at
last, the unseen had impacted on the seen, and all that they could say
was  Treachery.  Mrs. Wilcox had been treacherous to the family, to the
laws of property, to her own written word. How did she expect Howards
End to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel? Was her husband, to whom it legally
belonged, to make it over to her as a free gift? Was the said Miss
Schlegel to have a life interest in it, or to own it absolutely? Was
there to be no compensation for the garage and other improvements that
they had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some
day? Treacherous! treacherous and absurd! When we think the dead both
treacherous and absurd, we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves
to their departure. That note, scribbled in pencil, sent through the
matron, was unbusinesslike as well as cruel, and decreased at once the
value of the woman who had written it.

 Ah, well!  said Mr. Wilcox, rising from the table.  I shouldn t have
thought it possible. 

 Mother couldn t have meant it,  said Evie, still frowning.

 No, my girl, of course not. 

 Mother believed so in ancestors too--it isn t like her to leave
anything to an outsider, who d never appreciate. 

 The whole thing is unlike her,  he announced.  If Miss Schlegel had
been poor, if she had wanted a house, I could understand it a little.
But she has a house of her own. Why should she want another? She
wouldn t have any use for Howards End. 

 That time may prove,  murmured Charles.

 How?  asked his sister.

 Presumably she knows--mother will have told her. She got twice or three
times into the nursing home. Presumably she is awaiting developments. 

 What a horrid woman!  And Dolly, who had recovered, cried,  Why, she
may be coming down to turn us out now! 

Charles put her right.  I wish she would,  he said ominously.  I could
then deal with her. 

 So could I,  echoed his father, who was feeling rather in the cold.
Charles had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in
telling him to eat his breakfast, but the boy as he grew up was a little
dictatorial, and assumed the post of chairman too readily.  I could deal
with her, if she comes, but she won t come. You re all a bit hard on
Miss Schlegel. 

 That Paul business was pretty scandalous, though. 

 I want no more of the Paul business, Charles, as I said at the time,
and besides, it is quite apart from this business. Margaret Schlegel has
been officious and tiresome during this terrible week, and we have
all suffered under her, but upon my soul she s honest. She s NOT in
collusion with the matron. I m absolutely certain of it. Nor was she
with the doctor, I m equally certain of that. She did not hide anything
from us, for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are.
She, like ourselves, was a dupe--  He stopped for a moment.  You see,
Charles, in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions.
Paul would not have left England, you would not have gone to Italy, nor
Evie and I into Yorkshire, if only we had known. Well, Miss Schlegel s
position has been equally false. Take all in all, she has not come out
of it badly. 

Evie said:  But those chrysanthemums-- 

 Or coming down to the funeral at all--  echoed Dolly.

 Why shouldn t she come down? She had the right to, and she stood far
back among the Hilton women. The flowers--certainly we should not have
sent such flowers, but they may have seemed the right thing to her,
Evie, and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany. 

 Oh, I forget she isn t really English,  cried Evie.  That would explain
a lot. 

 She s a cosmopolitan,  said Charles, looking at his watch.  I admit I m
rather down on cosmopolitans. My fault, doubtless. I cannot stand them,
and a German cosmopolitan is the limit. I think that s about all, isn t
it? I want to run down and see Chalkeley. A bicycle will do. And, by the
way, I wish you d speak to Crane some time. I m certain he s had my new
car out. 

 Has he done it any harm? 

 No. 

 In that case I shall let it pass. It s not worth while having a row. 

Charles and his father sometimes disagreed. But they always parted
with an increased regard for one another, and each desired no doughtier
comrade when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions.
So the sailors of Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens, having first stopped
one another s ears with wool.

",the funeral was over  the carriages had rolled away through the soft mud  and only the poor remained  they approached to the newly dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin  now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay  it was their moment  most of them were women from the dead woman s district  to whom black garments had been served out by mr  wilcox s orders  pure curiosity had brought others  they thrilled with the excitement of a death  and of a rapid death  and stood in groups or moved between the graves  like drops of ink  the son of one of them  a wood cutter  was perched high above their heads  pollarding one of the churchyard elms  from where he sat he could see the village of hilton  strung upon the north road  with its accreting suburbs  the sunset beyond  scarlet and orange  winking at him beneath brows of grey  the church  the plantations  and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms  but he  too  was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth  he tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching  how he could not leave his work  and yet did not like to go on with it  how he had almost slipped out of the tree  he was so upset  the rooks had cawed  and no wonder  it was as if rooks knew too  his mother claimed the prophetic power herself  she had seen a strange look about mrs  wilcox for some time  london had done the mischief  said others  she had been a kind lady  her grandmother had been kind  too  a plainer person  but very kind  ah  the old sort was dying out  mr  wilcox  he was a kind gentleman  they advanced to the topic again and again  dully  but with exaltation  the funeral of a rich person was to them what the funeral of alcestis or ophelia is to the educated  it was art  though remote from life  it enhanced life s values  and they witnessed it avidly   the grave diggers  who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval  they disliked charles  it was not a moment to speak of such things  but they did not like charles wilcox  the grave diggers finished their work and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it  the sun set over hilton  the grey brows of the evening flushed a little  and were cleft with one scarlet frown  chattering sadly to each other  the mourners passed through the lych gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village  the young wood cutter stayed a little longer  poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically  at last the bough fell beneath his saw  with a grunt  he descended  his thoughts dwelling no longer on death  but on love  for he was mating  he stopped as he passed the new grave  a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye   they didn t ought to have coloured flowers at buryings   he reflected  trudging on a few steps  he stopped again  looked furtively at the dusk  turned back  wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf  and hid it in his pocket   after him came silence absolute  the cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty  and no other house stood near  hour after hour the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it  clouds drifted over it from the west  or the church may have been a ship  high prowed  steering with all its company towards infinity  towards morning the air grew colder  the sky clearer  the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead  the wood cutter  returning after a night of joy  reflected   they lilies  they chrysants  it s a pity i didn t take them all    up at howards end they were attempting breakfast  charles and evie sat in the dining room  with mrs  charles  their father  who could not bear to see a face  breakfasted upstairs  he suffered acutely  pain came over him in spasms  as if it was physical  and even while he was about to eat  his eyes would fill with tears  and he would lay down the morsel untasted   he remembered his wife s even goodness during thirty years  not anything in detail  not courtship or early raptures  but just the unvarying virtue  that seemed to him a woman s noblest quality  so many women are capricious  breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity  not so his wife  year after year  summer and winter  as bride and mother  she had been the same  he had always trusted her  her tenderness  her innocence  the wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of god  ruth knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden  or the grass in her field  her idea of business   henry  why do people who have enough money try to get more money   her idea of politics   i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet  there would be no more wars   her idea of religion  ah  this had been a cloud  but a cloud that passed  she came of quaker stock  and he and his family  formerly dissenters  were now members of the church of england  the rector s sermons had at first repelled her  and she had expressed a desire for  a more inward light   adding   not so much for myself as for baby   charles   inward light must have been granted  for he heard no complaints in later years  they brought up their three children without dispute  they had never disputed   she lay under the earth now  she had gone  and as if to make her going the more bitter  had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her   why didn t you tell me you knew of it   he had moaned  and her faint voice had answered   i didn t want to  henry  i might have been wrong  and every one hates illnesses   he had been told of the horror by a strange doctor  whom she had consulted during his absence from town  was this altogether just  without fully explaining  she had died  it was a fault on her part  and  tears rushed into his eyes  what a little fault  it was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years   he rose to his feet and looked out of the window  for evie had come in with the letters  and he could meet no one s eye  ah yes  she had been a good woman  she had been steady  he chose the word deliberately  to him steadiness included all praise  he himself  gazing at the wintry garden  is in appearance a steady man  his face was not as square as his son s  and  indeed  the chin  though firm enough in outline  retreated a little  and the lips  ambiguous  were curtained by a moustache  but there was no external hint of weakness  the eyes  if capable of kindness and good fellowship  if ruddy for the moment with tears  were the eyes of one who could not be driven  the forehead  too  was like charles s  high and straight  brown and polished  merging abruptly into temples and skull  it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world  at times it had the effect of a blank wall  he had dwelt behind it  intact and happy  for fifty years   the post s come  father   said evie awkwardly    thanks  put it down     has the breakfast been all right     yes  thanks    the girl glanced at him and at it with constraint  she did not know what to do    charles says do you want the times     no  i ll read it later     ring if you want anything  father  won t you     i ve all i want    having sorted the letters from the circulars  she went back to the dining room    father s eaten nothing   she announced  sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the tea urn   charles did not answer  but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs  opened the door  and said  look here father  you must eat  you know    and having paused for a reply that did not come  stole down again   he s going to read his letters first  i think   he said evasively   i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards   then he took up the times  and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate   poor mrs  charles sat between her silent companions terrified at the course of events  and a little bored  she was a rubbishy little creature  and she knew it  a telegram had dragged her from naples to the death bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known  a word from her husband had plunged her into mourning  she desired to mourn inwardly as well  but she wished that mrs  wilcox  since fated to die  could have died before the marriage  for then less would have been expected of her  crumbling her toast  and too nervous to ask for the butter  she remained almost motionless  thankful only for this  that her father in law was having his breakfast upstairs   at last charles spoke   they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday   he said to his sister    no  indeed     i must make a note of that   he continued   i am surprised that the rector allowed it     perhaps it may not be the rector s affair     whose else could it be     the lord of the manor     impossible     butter  dolly     thank you  evie dear  charles      yes  dear     i didn t know one could pollard elms  i thought one only pollarded willows     oh no  one can pollard elms     then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded   charles frowned a little  and turned again to his sister    another point  i must speak to chalkeley     yes  rather  you must complain to chalkeley     it s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men  he is responsible     yes  rather    brother and sister were not callous  they spoke thus  partly because they desired to keep chalkeley up to the mark  a healthy desire in its way  partly because they avoided the personal note in life  all wilcoxes did  it did not seem to them of supreme importance  or it may be as helen supposed  they realised its importance  but were afraid of it  panic and emptiness  could one glance behind  they were not callous  and they left the breakfast table with aching hearts  their mother never had come in to breakfast  it was in the other rooms  and especially in the garden  that they felt her loss most  as charles went out to the garage  he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could never replace  what battles he had fought against her gentle conservatism  how she had disliked improvements  yet how loyally she had accepted them when made  he and his father  what trouble they had had to get this very garage  with what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them the paddock for it  the paddock that she loved more dearly than the garden itself  the vine  she had got her way about the vine  it still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches  and so with evie  as she stood talking to the cook  though she could take up her mother s work inside the house  just as the man could take it up without  she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life  their grief  though less poignant than their father s  grew from deeper roots  for a wife may be replaced  a mother never  charles would go back to the office  there was little at howards end  the contents of his mother s will had long been known to them  there were no legacies  no annuities  none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities  trusting her husband  she had left him everything without reserve  she was quite a poor woman  the house had been all her dowry  and the house would come to charles in time  her watercolours mr  wilcox intended to reserve for paul  while evie would take the jewellery and lace  how easily she slipped out of life  charles thought the habit laudable  though he did not intend to adopt it himself  whereas margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable indifference to earthly fame  cynicism  not the superficial cynicism that snarls and sneers  but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and tenderness  that was the note of mrs  wilcox s will  she wanted not to vex people  that accomplished  the earth might freeze over her for ever   no  there was nothing for charles to wait for  he could not go on with his honeymoon  so he would go up to london and work  he felt too miserable hanging about  he and dolly would have the furnished flat while his father rested quietly in the country with evie  he could also keep an eye on his own little house  which was being painted and decorated for him in one of the surrey suburbs  and in which he hoped to install himself soon after christmas  yes  he would go up after lunch in his new motor  and the town servants  who had come down for the funeral  would go up by train   he found his father s chauffeur in the garage  said  morning  without looking at the man s face  and bending over the car  continued   hullo  my new car s been driven     has it  sir     yes   said charles  getting rather red   and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly  for there s mud on the axle  take it off    the man went for the cloths without a word  he was a chauffeur as ugly as sin  not that this did him disservice with charles  who thought charm in a man rather rot  and had soon got rid of the little italian beast with whom they had started    charles    his bride was tripping after him over the hoar frost  a dainty black column  her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof    one minute  i m busy  well  crane  who s been driving it  do you suppose     don t know  i m sure  sir  no one s driven it since i ve been back  but  of course  there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire    the mud came off easily    charles  your father s down  something s happened  he wants you in the house at once  oh  charles     wait  dear  wait a minute  who had the key of the garage while you were away  crane     the gardener  sir     do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor     no  sir  no one s had the motor out  sir     then how do you account for the mud on the axle     i can t  of course  say for the time i ve been in yorkshire  no more mud now  sir    charles was vexed  the man was treating him as a fool  and if his heart had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father  but it was not a morning for complaints  ordering the motor to be round after lunch  he joined his wife  who had all the while been pouring out some incoherent story about a letter and a miss schlegel    now  dolly  i can attend to you  miss schlegel  what does she want    when people wrote a letter charles always asked what they wanted  want was to him the only because of action  and the question in this case was correct  for his wife replied   she wants howards end     howards end  now  crane  just don t forget to put on the stepney wheel     no  sir     now  mind you don t forget  for i  come  little woman   when they were out of the chauffeur s sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed her against him  all his affection and half his attention  it was what he granted her throughout their happy married life    but you haven t listened  charles     what s wrong     i keep on telling you  howards end  miss schlegel s got it     got what   said charles  unclasping her   what the dickens are you talking about     now  charles  you promised not to say those naughty      look here  i m in no mood for foolery  it s no morning for it either     i tell you  i keep on telling you  miss schlegel  she s got it  your mother s left it to her  and you ve all got to move out     howards end     howards end   she screamed  mimicking him  and as she did so evie came dashing out of the shubbery    dolly  go back at once  my father s much annoyed with you  charles   she hit herself wildly   come in at once to father  he s had a letter that s too awful    charles began to run  but checked himself  and stepped heavily across the gravel path  there the house was with the nine windows  the unprolific vine  he exclaimed   schlegels again   and as if to complete chaos  dolly said   oh no  the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her     come in  all three of you   cried his father  no longer inert    dolly  why have you disobeyed me     oh  mr  wilcox      i told you not to go out to the garage  i ve heard you all shouting in the garden  i won t have it  come in    he stood in the porch  transformed  letters in his hand    into the dining room  every one of you  we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants  here  charles  here  read these  see what you make    charles took two letters  and read them as he followed the procession  the first was a covering note from the matron  mrs  wilcox had desired her  when the funeral should be over  to forward the enclosed  the enclosed  it was from his mother herself  she had written   to my husband  i should like miss schlegel  margaret  to have howards end     i suppose we re going to have a talk about this   he remarked  ominously calm    certainly  i was coming out to you when dolly      well  let s sit down     come  evie  don t waste time  sit  down    in silence they drew up to the breakfast table  the events of yesterday  indeed  of this morning suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it  heavy breathings were heard  they were calming themselves  charles  to steady them further  read the enclosure out loud   a note in my mother s handwriting  in an envelope addressed to my father  sealed  inside   i should like miss schlegel  margaret  to have howards end   no date  no signature  forwarded through the matron of that nursing home  now  the question is     dolly interrupted him   but i say that note isn t legal  houses ought to be done by a lawyer  charles  surely    her husband worked his jaw severely  little lumps appeared in front of either ear  a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect  and she asked whether she might see the note  charles looked at his father for permission  who said abstractedly   give it her   she seized it  and at once exclaimed   why  it s only in pencil  i said so  pencil never counts     we know that it is not legally binding  dolly   said mr  wilcox  speaking from out of his fortress   we are aware of that  legally  i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire  of course  my dear  we consider you as one of the family  but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand    charles  vexed both with his father and his wife  then repeated   the question is    he had cleared a space of the breakfast table from plates and knives  so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth   the question is whether miss schlegel  during the fortnight we were all away  whether she unduly    he stopped    i don t think that   said his father  whose nature was nobler than his son s    don t think what     that she would have  that it is a case of undue influence  no  to my mind the question is the  the invalid s condition at the time she wrote     my dear father  consult an expert if you like  but i don t admit it is my mother s writing     why  you just said it was   cried dolly    never mind if i did   he blazed out   and hold your tongue    the poor little wife coloured at this  and  drawing her handkerchief from her pocket  she would a few tears  no one noticed her  evie was scowling like an angry boy  the two men were gradually assuming the manner of the committee room  they were both at their best when serving on committees  they did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk  but disposed of them item by item  sharply  caligraphy was the item before them now  and on it they turned their well trained brains  charles  after a little demur  accepted the writing as genuine  and they passed on to the next point  it is the best  perhaps the only  way of dodging emotion  they were the average human article  and had they considered the note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad  considered item by item  the emotional content was minimised  and all went forward smoothly  the clock ticked  the coals blazed higher  and contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows  unnoticed  the sun occupied his sky  and the shadows of the tree stems  extraordinarily solid  fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn  it was a glorious winter morning  evie s fox terrier  who had passed for white  was only a dirty grey dog now  so intense was the purity that surrounded him  he was discredited  but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with arabian darkness  for all the conventional colouring of life had been altered  inside  the clock struck ten with

if she comes  but she won t come  you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel     that paul business was pretty scandalous  though     i want no more of the paul business  charles  as i said at the time  and besides  it is quite apart from this business  margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week  and we have all suffered under her  but upon my soul she s honest  she s not in collusion with the matron  i m absolutely certain of it  nor was she with the doctor  i m equally certain of that  she did not hide anything from us  for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are  she  like ourselves  was a dupe    he stopped for a moment   you see  charles  in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions  paul would not have left england  you would not have gone to italy  nor evie and i into yorkshire  if only we had known  well  miss schlegel s position has been equally false  take all in all  she has not come out of it badly    evie said   but those chrysanthemums      or coming down to the funeral at all    echoed dolly    why shouldn t she come down  she had the right to  and she stood far back among the hilton women  the flowers  certainly we should not have sent such flowers  but they may have seemed the right thing to her  evie  and for all you know they may be the custom in germany     oh  i forget she isn t really english

Charles need not have been anxious. Miss Schlegel had never heard of his
mother s strange request. She was to hear of it in after years, when she
had built up her life differently, and it was to fit into position as
the headstone of the corner. Her mind was bent on other questions
now, and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an
invalid.

She was parting from these Wilcoxes for the second time. Paul and his
mother, ripple and great wave, had flowed into her life and ebbed out of
it for ever. The ripple had left no traces behind; the wave had strewn
at her feet fragments torn from the unknown. A curious seeker, she stood
for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little, but tells
a little, and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide. Her
friend had vanished in agony, but not, she believed, in degradation.
Her withdrawal had hinted at other things besides disease and pain. Some
leave our life with tears, others with an insane frigidity; Mrs. Wilcox
had taken the middle course, which only rarer natures can pursue. She
had kept proportion. She had told a little of her grim secret to her
friends, but not too much; she had shut up her heart--almost, but
not entirely. It is thus, if there is any rule, that we ought to
die--neither as victim nor as fanatic, but as the seafarer who can greet
with an equal eye the deep that he is entering, and the shore that he
must leave.

The last word--whatever it would be--had certainly not been said in
Hilton churchyard. She had not died there. A funeral is not death, any
more than baptism is birth or marriage union. All three are the clumsy
devices, coming now too late, now too early, by which Society would
register the quick motions of man. In Margaret s eyes Mrs. Wilcox had
escaped registration. She had gone out of life vividly, her own way, and
no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin, lowered
with ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth, no flowers so
utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered
before morning. Margaret had once said she  loved superstition.  It was
not true. Few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in
which body and soul are enwrapped. The death of Mrs. Wilcox had helped
her in her work. She saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a
human being is, and to what he may aspire. Truer relationships gleamed.
Perhaps the last word would be hope--hope even on this side of the
grave.

Meanwhile, she could take an interest in the survivors. In spite of her
Christmas duties, in spite of her brother, the Wilcoxes continued to
play a considerable part in her thoughts. She had seen so much of them
in the final week. They were not  her sort,  they were often suspicious
and stupid, and deficient where she excelled; but collision with them
stimulated her, and she felt an interest that verged into liking, even
for Charles. She desired to protect them, and often felt that they could
protect her, excelling where she was deficient. Once past the rocks of
emotion, they knew so well what to do, whom to send for; their hands
were on all the ropes, they had grit as well as grittiness and she
valued grit enormously. They led a life that she could not attain
to--the outer life of  telegrams and anger,  which had detonated when
Helen and Paul had touched in June, and had detonated again the other
week. To Margaret this life was to remain a real force. She could not
despise it, as Helen and Tibby affected to do. It fostered such virtues
as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no
doubt, but they have formed our civilisation. They form character, too;
Margaret could not doubt it; they keep the soul from becoming sloppy.
How dare Schlegels despise Wilcoxes, when it takes all sorts to make a
world?

 Don t brood too much,  she wrote to Helen,  on the superiority of
the unseen to the seen. It s true, but to brood on it is medieval. Our
business is not to contrast the two, but to reconcile them. 

Helen replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull
subject. What did her sister take her for? The weather was magnificent.
She and the Mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that
Pomerania boasted. It was fun, but over-crowded, for the rest of
Pomerania had gone there too. Helen loved the country, and her letter
glowed with physical exercise and poetry. She spoke of the scenery,
quiet, yet august; of the snow-clad fields, with their scampering herds
of deer; of the river and its quaint entrance into the Baltic Sea; of
the Oderberge, only three hundred feet high, from which one slid all too
quickly back into the Pomeranian plains, and yet these Oderberge were
real mountains, with pine-forests, streams, and views complete.  It
isn t size that counts so much as the way things are arranged.  In
another paragraph she referred to Mrs. Wilcox sympathetically, but the
news had not bitten into her. She had not realised the accessories
of death, which are in a sense more memorable than death itself. The
atmosphere of precautions and recriminations, and in the midst a human
body growing more vivid because it was in pain; the end of that body in
Hilton churchyard; the survival of something that suggested hope, vivid
in its turn against life s workaday cheerfulness;--all these were lost
to Helen, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be pleasant no
longer. She returned to Wickham Place full of her own affairs--she had
had another proposal--and Margaret, after a moment s hesitation, was
content that this should be so.

The proposal had not been a serious matter. It was the work of Fraulein
Mosebach, who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning
back her cousins to the Fatherland by matrimony. England had played Paul
Wilcox, and lost; Germany played Herr Forstmeister some one--Helen could
not remember his name. Herr Forstmeister lived in a wood, and, standing
on the summit of the Oderberge, he had pointed out his house to Helen,
or rather, had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay. She had
exclaimed,  Oh, how lovely! That s the place for me!  and in the evening
Frieda appeared in her bedroom.  I have a message, dear Helen,  etc.,
and so she had, but had been very nice when Helen laughed; quite
understood--a forest too solitary and damp--quite agreed, but Herr
Forstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary. Germany had
lost, but with good-humour; holding the manhood of the world, she felt
bound to win.  And there will even be some one for Tibby,  concluded
Helen.  There now, Tibby, think of that; Frieda is saving up a little
girl for you, in pig-tails and white worsted stockings but the feet
of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in
strawberries. I ve talked too much. My head aches. Now you talk. 

Tibby consented to talk. He too was full of his own affairs, for he had
just been up to try for a scholarship at Oxford. The men were down, and
the candidates had been housed in various colleges, and had dined in
hall. Tibby was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he
gave a description of his visit that was almost glowing. The august and
mellow University, soaked with the richness of the western counties that
it has served for a thousand years, appealed at once to the boy s taste;
it was the kind of thing he could understand, and he understood it
all the better because it was empty. Oxford is--Oxford; not a mere
receptacle for youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its inmates to
love it rather than to love one another; such at all events was to
be its effect on Tibby. His sisters sent him there that he might make
friends, for they knew that his education had been cranky, and had
severed him from other boys and men. He made no friends. His Oxford
remained Oxford empty, and he took into life with him, not the memory of
a radiance, but the memory of a colour scheme.

It pleased Margaret to hear her brother and sister talking. They did
not get on overwell as a rule. For a few moments she listened to them,
feeling elderly and benign.

Then something occurred to her, and she interrupted.

 Helen, I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox; that sad business? 

 Yes. 

 I have had a correspondence with her son. He was winding up the estate,
and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything.
I thought it good of him, considering I knew her so little. I said that
she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present, but we both forgot
about it afterwards. 

 I hope Charles took the hint. 

 Yes--that is to say, her husband wrote later on, and thanked me for
being a little kind to her, and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette.
Don t you think that is extraordinarily generous? It has made me
like him very much. He hopes that this will not be the end of our
acquaintance, but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in
the future. I like Mr. Wilcox. He is taking up his work--rubber--it is
a big business. I gather he is launching out rather. Charles is in it,
too. Charles is married--a pretty little creature, but she doesn t seem
wise. They took on the flat, but now they have gone off to a house of
their own. 

Helen, after a decent pause, continued her account of Stettin. How
quickly a situation changes! In June she had been in a crisis; even in
November she could blush and be unnatural; now it was January and
the whole affair lay forgotten. Looking back on the past six months,
Margaret realised the chaotic nature of our daily life, and its
difference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by
historians. Actual life is full of false clues and sign-posts that lead
nowhere. With infinite effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never
comes. The most successful career must show a waste of strength that
might have removed mountains, and the most unsuccessful is not that
of the man who is taken unprepared, but of him who has prepared and is
never taken. On a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly
silent. It assumes that preparation against danger is in itself a good,
and that men, like nations, are the better for staggering through life
fully armed. The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save
by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality
would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of
it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its
essence is romantic beauty. Margaret hoped that for the future she would
be less cautious, not more cautious, than she had been in the past.

Over two years passed, and the Schlegel household continued to lead its
life of cultured, but not ignoble, ease, still swimming gracefully on
the grey tides of London. Concerts and plays swept past them, money had
been spent and renewed, reputations won and lost, and the city herself,
emblematic of their lives, rose and fell in a continual flux, while her
shallows washed more widely against the hills of Surrey and over the
fields of Hertfordshire. This famous building had arisen, that was
doomed. To-day Whitehall had been transformed; it would be the turn
of Regent Street to-morrow. And month by month the roads smelt more
strongly of petrol, and were more difficult to cross, and human beings
heard each other speak with greater difficulty, breathed less of the
air, and saw less of the sky. Nature withdrew; the leaves were falling
by midsummer; the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity.

To speak against London is no longer fashionable. The Earth as an
artistic cult has had its day, and the literature of the near future
will probably ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town. One
can understand the reaction. Of Pan and the elemental forces, the public
has heard a little too much--they seem Victorian, while London is
Georgian--and those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long
ere the pendulum swings back to her again. Certainly London fascinates.
One visualises it as a tract of quivering grey, intelligent without
purpose, and excitable without love; as a spirit that has altered before
it can be chronicled; as a heart that certainly beats, but with no
pulsation of humanity. It lies beyond everything; Nature, with all
her cruelty, comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men. A friend
explains himself; the earth is explicable--from her we came, and we must
return to her. But who can explain Westminster Bridge Road or Liverpool
Street in the morning--the city inhaling--or the same thoroughfares
in the evening--the city exhaling her exhausted air? We reach in
desperation beyond the fog, beyond the very stars, the voids of the
universe are ransacked to justify the monster, and stamped with a human
face. London is religion s opportunity--not the decorous religion of
theologians, but anthropomorphic, crude. Yes, the continuous flow
would be tolerable if a man of our own sort--not any one pompous or
tearful--were caring for us up in the sky.

The Londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him, too, away
from his moorings, and Margaret s eyes were not opened until the lease
of Wickham Place expired. She had always known that it must expire, but
the knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event.
Then the house was suddenly ringed with pathos. It had seen so much
happiness. Why had it to be swept away? In the streets of the city
she noted for the first time the architecture of hurry and heard the
language of hurry on the mouths of its inhabitants--clipped words,
formless sentences, potted expressions of approval or disgust. Month by
month things were stepping livelier, but to what goal? The population
still rose, but what was the quality of the men born? The particular
millionaire who owned the freehold of Wickham Place, and desired to
erect Babylonian flats upon it--what right had he to stir so large a
portion of the quivering jelly? He was not a fool--she had heard him
expose Socialism--but true insight began just where his intelligence
ended, and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires.
What right had such men--But Margaret checked herself. That way lies
madness. Thank goodness, she, too, had some money, and could purchase a
new home.

Tibby, now in his second year at Oxford, was down for the Easter
vacation, and Margaret took the opportunity of having a serious talk
with him. Did he at all know where he wanted to live? Tibby didn t
know that he did know. Did he at all know what he wanted to do? He was
equally uncertain, but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to
be quite free of any profession. Margaret was not shocked, but went on
sewing for a few minutes before she replied:

 I was thinking of Mr. Vyse. He never strikes me as particularly happy. 

 Ye--es.  said Tibby, and then held his mouth open in a curious quiver,
as if he, too, had thought of Mr. Vyse, had seen round, through, over,
and beyond Mr. Vyse, had weighed Mr. Vyse, grouped him, and finally
dismissed him as having no possible bearing on the Subject under
discussion. That bleat of Tibby s infuriated Helen. But Helen was now
down in the dining room preparing a speech about political economy. At
times her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor.

 But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched, weedy man, don t you think? Then
there s Guy. That was a pitiful business. Besides --shifting to the
general-- every one is the better for some regular work. 

Groans.

 I shall stick to it,  she continued, smiling.  I am not saying it
to educate you; it is what I really think. I believe that in the last
century men have developed the desire for work, and they must not starve
it. It s a new desire. It goes with a great deal that s bad, but in
itself it s good, and I hope that for women, too,  not to work  will
soon become as shocking as  not to be married  was a hundred years ago. 

 I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude, 
 enunciated Tibby.

 Then we ll leave the subject till you do. I m not going to rattle you
round. Take your time. Only do think over the lives of the men you like
most, and see how they ve arranged them. 

 I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most,  said Tibby faintly, and leant so far
back in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to
throat.

 And don t think I m not serious because I don t use the traditional
arguments--making money, a sphere awaiting you, and so on--all of which
are, for various reasons, cant.  She sewed on.  I m only your sister.
I haven t any authority over you, and I don t want to have any. Just
to put before you what I think the Truth. You see --she shook off the
pince-nez to which she had recently taken-- in a few years we shall be
the same age practically, and I shall want you to help me. Men are so
much nicer than women. 

 Labouring under such a delusion, why do you not marry? 

 I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance. 

 Has nobody arst you? 

 Only ninnies. 

 Do people ask Helen? 

 Plentifully. 

 Tell me about them. 

 No. 

 Tell me about your ninnies, then. 

 They were men who had nothing better to do,  said his sister, feeling
that she was entitled to score this point.  So take warning; you must
work, or else you must pretend to work, which is what I do. Work, work,
work if you d save your soul and your body. It is honestly a necessity,
dear boy. Look at the Wilcoxes, look at Mr. Pembroke. With all their
defects of temper and understanding, such men give me more pleasure than
many who are better equipped, and I think it is because they have worked
regularly and honestly. 

 Spare me the Wilcoxes,  he moaned.

 I shall not. They are the right sort. 

 Oh, goodness me, Meg--!  he protested, suddenly sitting up, alert and
angry. Tibby, for all his defects, had a genuine personality.

 Well, they re as near the right sort as you can imagine. 

 No, no--oh, no! 

 I was thinking of the younger son, whom I once classed as a ninny,
but who came back so ill from Nigeria. He s gone out there again, Evie
Wilcox tells me--out to his duty. 

 Duty  always elicited a groan.

 He doesn t want the money, it is work he wants, though it is beastly
work--dull country, dishonest natives, an eternal fidget over fresh
water and food... A nation that can produce men of that sort may well be
proud. No wonder England has become an Empire. 

 EMPIRE! 

 I can t bother over results,  said Margaret, a little sadly.  They are
too difficult for me. I can only look at the men. An Empire bores me,
so far, but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up. London
bores me, but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make
London-- 

 What it is,  he sneered.

 What it is, worse luck. I want activity without civilisation. How
paradoxical! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven. 

 And I,  said Tibby,  want civilisation without activity, which, I
expect, is what we shall find in the other place. 

 You needn t go as far as the other place, Tibbikins, if you want that.
You can find it at Oxford. 

 Stupid-- 

 If I m stupid, get me back to the house-hunting. I ll even live in
Oxford if you like--North Oxford. I ll live anywhere except Bournemouth,
Torquay, and Cheltenham. Oh yes, or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge
Wells and Surbiton and Bedford. There on no account. 

 London, then. 

 I agree, but Helen rather wants to get away from London. However,
there s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a
flat in town, provided we all stick together and contribute. Though of
course--Oh, how one does maunder on and to think, to think of the people
who are really poor. How do they live? Not to move about the world would
kill me. 

As she spoke, the door was flung open, and Helen burst in in a state of
extreme excitement.

 Oh, my dears, what do you think? You ll never guess. A woman s been
here asking me for her husband. Her WHAT?  (Helen was fond of supplying
her own surprise.)  Yes, for her husband, and it really is so. 

 Not anything to do with Bracknell?  cried Margaret, who had lately
taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots.

 I offered Bracknell, and he was rejected. So was Tibby. (Cheer up,
Tibby!) It s no one we know. I said,  Hunt, my good woman; have a good
look round, hunt under the tables, poke up the chimney, shake out the
antimacassars. Husband? husband?  Oh, and she so magnificently dressed
and tinkling like a chandelier. 

 Now, Helen, what did really happen? 

 What I say. I was, as it were, orating my speech. Annie opens the door
like a fool, and shows a female straight in on me, with my mouth open.
Then we began--very civilly.  I want my husband, what I have reason to
believe is here.  No--how unjust one is. She said  whom,  not  what. 
She got it perfectly. So I said,  Name, please?  and she said,  Lan,
Miss,  and there we were. 

 Lan? 

 Lan or Len. We were not nice about our vowels. Lanoline. 

 But what an extraordinary-- 

 I said,  My good Mrs. Lanoline, we have some grave misunderstanding
here. Beautiful as I am, my modesty is even more remarkable than my
beauty, and never, never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine.  

 I hope you were pleased,  said Tibby.

 Of course,  Helen squeaked.  A perfectly delightful experience.
Oh, Mrs. Lanoline s a dear--she asked for a husband as if he were
an umbrella. She mislaid him Saturday afternoon--and for a long time
suffered no inconvenience. But all night, and all this morning her
apprehensions grew. Breakfast didn t seem the same--no, no more did
lunch, and so she strolled up to 2 Wickham Place as being the most
likely place for the missing article. 

 But how on earth-- 

 Don t begin how on earthing.  I know what I know,  she kept repeating,
not uncivilly, but with extreme gloom. In vain I asked her what she did
know. Some knew what others knew, and others didn t, and then others
again had better be careful. Oh dear, she was incompetent! She had
a face like a silkworm, and the dining-room reeks of orris-root. We
chatted pleasantly a little about husbands, and I wondered where hers
was too, and advised her to go to the police. She thanked me. We agreed
that Mr. Lanoline s a notty, notty man, and hasn t no business to go
on the lardy-da. But I think she suspected me up to the last. Bags I
writing to Aunt Juley about this. Now, Meg, remember--bags I. 

 Bag it by all means,  murmured Margaret, putting down her work.  I m
not sure that this is so funny, Helen. It means some horrible volcano
smoking somewhere, doesn t it? 

 I don t think so--she doesn t really mind. The admirable creature isn t
capable of tragedy. 

 Her husband may be, though,  said Margaret, moving to the window.

 Oh no, not likely. No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs.
Lanoline. 

 Was she pretty? 

 Her figure may have been good once. 

The flats, their only outlook, hung like an ornate curtain between
Margaret and the welter of London. Her thoughts turned sadly
to house-hunting. Wickham Place had been so safe. She feared,
fantastically, that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil
and squalor, into nearer contact with such episodes as these.

 Tibby and I have again been wondering where we ll live next September, 
 she said at last.

 Tibby had better first wonder what he ll do,  retorted Helen; and that
topic was resumed, but with acrimony. Then tea came, and after tea Helen
went on preparing her speech, and Margaret prepared one, too, for they
were going out to a discussion society on the morrow. But her thoughts
were poisoned. Mrs. Lanoline had risen out of the abyss, like a faint
smell, a goblin football, telling of a life where love and hatred had
both decayed.

",over two years passed  and the schlegel household continued to lead its life of cultured  but not ignoble  ease  still swimming gracefully on the grey tides of london  concerts and plays swept past

The mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained. Next day, just as
they were dressed to go out to dinner, a Mr. Bast called. He was a clerk
in the employment of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. Thus much
from his card. He had come  about the lady yesterday.  Thus much from
Annie, who had shown him into the dining-room.

 Cheers, children!  cried Helen.  It s Mrs. Lanoline. 

Tibby was interested. The three hurried downstairs, to find, not the
gay dog they expected, but a young man, colourless, toneless, who had
already the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so
common in London, and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing
presences. One guessed him as the third generation, grandson to the
shepherd or ploughboy whom civilisation had sucked into the town; as one
of the thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach
the life of the spirit. Hints of robustness survived in him, more than a
hint of primitive good looks, and Margaret, noting the spine that might
have been straight, and the chest that might have broadened, wondered
whether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a
couple of ideas. Culture had worked in her own case, but during the last
few weeks she had doubted whether it humanised the majority, so wide
and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the
philosophic man, so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to
cross it. She knew this type very well--the vague aspirations, the
mental dishonesty, the familiarity with the outsides of books. She knew
the very tones in which he would address her. She was only unprepared
for an example of her own visiting-card.

 You wouldn t remember giving me this, Miss Schlegel?  said he, uneasily
familiar.

 No; I can t say I do. 

 Well, that was how it happened, you see. 

 Where did we meet, Mr. Bast? For the minute I don t remember. 

 It was a concert at the Queen s Hall. I think you will recollect,  he
added pretentiously,  when I tell you that it included a performance of
the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven. 

 We hear the Fifth practically every time it s done, so I m not sure--do
you remember, Helen? 

 Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade? 

He thought not.

 Then I don t remember. That s the only Beethoven I ever remember
specially. 

 And you, if I may say so, took away my umbrella, inadvertently of
course. 

 Likely enough,  Helen laughed,  for I steal umbrellas even oftener than
I hear Beethoven. Did you get it back? 

 Yes, thank you, Miss Schlegel. 

 The mistake arose out of my card, did it?  interposed Margaret.

 Yes, the mistake arose--it was a mistake. 

 The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too,
and that she could find you?  she continued, pushing him forward, for,
though he had promised an explanation, he seemed unable to give one.

 That s so, calling too--a mistake. 

 Then why--?  began Helen, but Margaret laid a hand on her arm.

 I said to my wife,  he continued more rapidly  I said to Mrs. Bast,  I
have to pay a call on some friends,  and Mrs. Bast said to me,  Do go. 
While I was gone, however, she wanted me on important business, and
thought I had come here, owing to the card, and so came after me, and I
beg to tender my apologies, and hers as well, for any inconvenience we
may have inadvertently caused you. 

 No inconvenience,  said Helen;  but I still don t understand. 

An air of evasion characterised Mr. Bast. He explained again, but was
obviously lying, and Helen didn t see why he should get off. She had the
cruelty of youth. Neglecting her sister s pressure, she said,  I still
don t understand. When did you say you paid this call? 

 Call? What call?  said he, staring as if her question had been a
foolish one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream.

 This afternoon call. 

 In the afternoon, of course!  he replied, and looked at Tibby to see
how the repartee went. But Tibby was unsympathetic, and said,  Saturday
afternoon or Sunday afternoon? 

 S--Saturday. 

 Really!  said Helen;  and you were still calling on Sunday, when your
wife came here. A long visit. 

 I don t call that fair,  said Mr. Bast, going scarlet and handsome.
There was fight in his eyes.  I know what you mean, and it isn t so. 

 Oh, don t let us mind,  said Margaret, distressed again by odours from
the abyss.

 It was something else,  he asserted, his elaborate manner breaking
down.  I was somewhere else to what you think, so there! 

 It was good of you to come and explain,  she said.  The rest is
naturally no concern of ours. 

 Yes, but I want--I wanted--have you ever read The Ordeal of Richard
Feverel? 

Margaret nodded.

 It s a beautiful book. I wanted to get back to the earth, don t you
see, like Richard does in the end. Or have you ever read Stevenson s
Prince Otto? 

Helen and Tibby groaned gently.

 That s another beautiful book. You get back to the earth in that. I
wanted--  He mouthed affectedly. Then through the mists of his culture
came a hard fact, hard as a pebble.  I walked all the Saturday night, 
 said Leonard.  I walked.  A thrill of approval ran through the sisters.
But culture closed in again. He asked whether they had ever read E. V.
Lucas s Open Road.

Said Helen,  No doubt it s another beautiful book, but I d rather hear
about your road. 

 Oh, I walked. 

 How far? 

 I don t know, nor for how long. It got too dark to see my watch. 

 Were you walking alone, may I ask? 

 Yes,  he said, straightening himself;  but we d been talking it over at
the office. There s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these
things. The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star, and I looked
it up in the celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so
mixed. 

 Don t talk to me about the Pole Star,  interrupted Helen, who was
becoming interested.  I know its little ways. It goes round and round,
and you go round after it. 

 Well, I lost it entirely. First of all the street lamps, then the
trees, and towards morning it got cloudy. 

Tibby, who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from the room. He
knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry, and did not want to
hear him trying.

Margaret and Helen remained. Their brother influenced them more than
they knew; in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily.

 Where did you start from?  cried Margaret.  Do tell us more. 

 I took the Underground to Wimbledon. As I came out of the office I said
to myself,  I must have a walk once in a way. If I don t take this walk
now, I shall never take it.  I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon, and
then-- 

 But not good country there, is it? 

 It was gas-lamps for hours. Still, I had all the night, and being out
was the great thing. I did get into woods, too, presently. 

 Yes, go on,  said Helen.

 You ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark. 

 Did you actually go off the roads? 

 Oh yes. I always meant to go off the roads, but the worst of it is that
it s more difficult to find one s way. 

 Mr. Bast, you re a born adventurer,  laughed Margaret.  No professional
athlete would have attempted what you ve done. It s a wonder your walk
didn t end in a broken neck. Whatever did your wife say? 

 Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses,  said
Helen.  Besides, they can t walk. It tires them. Go on. 

 I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus. 

 Yes, but the wood. This  ere wood. How did you get out of it? 

 I managed one wood, and found a road the other side which went a good
bit uphill. I rather fancy it was those North Downs, for the road went
off into grass, and I got into another wood. That was awful, with gorse
bushes. I did wish I d never come, but suddenly it got light--just while
I seemed going under one tree. Then I found a road down to a station,
and took the first train I could back to London. 

 But was the dawn wonderful?  asked Helen.

With unforgettable sincerity he replied,  No.  The word flew again like
a pebble from the sling. Down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or
literary in his talk, down toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the  love of
the earth  and his silk top-hat. In the presence of these women Leonard
had arrived, and he spoke with a flow, an exultation, that he had seldom
known.

 The dawn was only grey, it was nothing to mention. 

 Just a grey evening turned upside down. I know. 

 --and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it, and so cold
too. I m glad I did it, and yet at the time it bored me more than I can
say. And besides--you can believe me or not as you choose--I was very
hungry. That dinner at Wimbledon--I meant it to last me all night
like other dinners. I never thought that walking would make such a
difference. Why, when you re walking you want, as it were, a breakfast
and luncheon and tea during the night as well, and I d nothing but a
packet of Woodbines. Lord, I did feel bad! Looking back, it wasn t what
you may call enjoyment. It was more a case of sticking to it. I did
stick. I--I was determined. Oh, hang it all! what s the good--I mean,
the good of living in a room for ever? There one goes on day after day,
same old game, same up and down to town, until you forget there is any
other game. You ought to see once in a way what s going on outside, if
it s only nothing particular after all. 

 I should just think you ought,  said Helen, sitting on the edge of the
table.

The sound of a lady s voice recalled him from sincerity, and he said:
 Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard
Jefferies. 

 Excuse me, Mr. Bast, but you re wrong there. It didn t. It came from
something far greater. 

But she could not stop him. Borrow was imminent after Jefferies--Borrow,
Thoreau, and sorrow. R. L. S. brought up the rear, and the outburst
ended in a swamp of books. No disrespect to these great names. The fault
is ours, not theirs. They mean us to use them for sign-posts, and are not
to blame if, in our weakness, we mistake the sign-post for the destination.
And Leonard had reached the destination. He had visited the county of
Surrey when darkness covered its amenities, and its cosy villas had
re-entered ancient night. Every twelve hours this miracle happens, but he
had troubled to go and see for himself. Within his cramped little mind
dwelt something that was greater than Jefferies  books--the spirit that led
Jefferies to write them; and his dawn, though revealing nothing but
monotones, was part of the eternal sunrise that shows George Borrow
Stonehenge.

 Then you don t think I was foolish?  he asked becoming again the naive
and sweet-tempered boy for whom Nature intended him.

 Heavens, no!  replied Margaret.

 Heaven help us if we do!  replied Helen.

 I m very glad you say that. Now, my wife would never understand--not if
I explained for days. 

 No, it wasn t foolish!  cried Helen, her eyes aflame.  You ve pushed
back the boundaries; I think it splendid of you. 

 You ve not been content to dream as we have-- 

 Though we have walked, too-- 

 I must show you a picture upstairs-- 

Here the door-bell rang. The hansom had come to take them to their
evening party.

 Oh, bother, not to say dash--I had forgotten we were dining out; but
do, do, come round again and have a talk.   Yes, you must--do,  echoed
Margaret.

Leonard, with extreme sentiment, replied:  No, I shall not. It s better
like this. 

 Why better?  asked Margaret.

 No, it is better not to risk a second interview. I shall always look
back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life.
Really. I mean this. We can never repeat. It has done me real good, and
there we had better leave it. 

 That s rather a sad view of life, surely. 

 Things so often get spoiled. 

 I know,  flashed Helen,  but people don t. 

He could not understand this. He continued in a vein which mingled true
imagination and false. What he said wasn t wrong, but it wasn t right,
and a false note jarred. One little twist, they felt, and the instrument
might be in tune. One little strain, and it might be silent for ever. He
thanked the ladies very much, but he would not call again. There was a
moment s awkwardness, and then Helen said:  Go, then; perhaps you know
best; but never forget you re better than Jefferies.  And he went. Their
hansom caught him up at the corner, passed with a waving of hands, and
vanished with its accomplished load into the evening.

London was beginning to illuminate herself against the night. Electric
lights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares, gas-lamps in the
side streets glimmered a canary gold or green. The sky was a crimson
battlefield of spring, but London was not afraid. Her smoke mitigated
the splendour, and the clouds down Oxford Street were a delicately
painted ceiling, which adorned while it did not distract. She had never
known the clear-cut armies of the purer air. Leonard hurried through her
tinted wonders, very much part of the picture. His was a grey life,
and to brighten it he had ruled off a few corners for romance. The Miss
Schlegels--or, to speak more accurately, his interview with them--were
to fill such a corner, nor was it by any means the first time that
he had talked intimately to strangers. The habit was analogous to a
debauch, an outlet, though the worst of outlets, for instincts that
would not be denied. Terrifying him, it would beat down his suspicions
and prudence until he was confiding secrets to people whom he had
scarcely seen. It brought him many fears and some pleasant memories.
Perhaps the keenest happiness he had ever known was during a railway
journey to Cambridge, where a decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken
to him. They had got into conversation, and gradually Leonard flung
reticence aside, told some of his domestic troubles and hinted at the
rest. The undergraduate, supposing they could start a friendship, asked
him to  coffee after hall,  which he accepted, but afterwards grew shy,
and took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he lodged.
He did not want Romance to collide with the Porphyrion, still less with
Jacky, and people with fuller, happier lives are slow to understand
this. To the Schlegels, as to the undergraduate, he was an interesting
creature, of whom they wanted to see more. But they to him were denizens
of Romance, who must keep to the corner he had assigned them, pictures
that must not walk out of their frames.

His behaviour over Margaret s visiting-card had been typical. His
had scarcely been a tragic marriage. Where there is no money and no
inclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated. He could not leave
his wife, and he did not want to hit her. Petulance and squalor were
enough. Here  that card  had come in. Leonard, though furtive, was
untidy, and left it lying about. Jacky found it, and then began,  What s
that card, eh?   Yes, don t you wish you knew what that card was?   Len,
who s Miss Schlegel?  etc. Months passed, and the card, now as a joke,
now as a grievance, was handed about, getting dirtier and dirtier. It
followed them when they moved from Camelia Road to Tulse Hill. It was
submitted to third parties. A few inches of pasteboard, it became the
battlefield on which the souls of Leonard and his wife contended. Why
did he not say,  A lady took my umbrella, another gave me this that I
might call for my umbrella ? Because Jacky would have disbelieved him?
Partly, but chiefly because he was sentimental. No affection gathered
round the card, but it symbolised the life of culture, that Jacky should
never spoil. At night he would say to himself,  Well, at all events, she
doesn t know about that card. Yah! done her there! 

Poor Jacky! she was not a bad sort, and had a great deal to bear.
She drew her own conclusion--she was only capable of drawing one
conclusion--and in the fulness of time she acted upon it. All the Friday
Leonard had refused to speak to her, and had spent the evening observing
the stars. On the Saturday he went up, as usual, to town, but he came
not back Saturday night, nor Sunday morning, nor Sunday afternoon. The
inconvenience grew intolerable, and though she was now of a retiring
habit, and shy of women, she went up to Wickham Place. Leonard returned
in her absence. The card, the fatal card, was gone from the pages of
Ruskin, and he guessed what had happened.

 Well?  he had exclaimed, greeting her with peals of laughter.  I know
where you ve been, but you don t know where I ve been. 

Jacky sighed, said,  Len, I do think you might explain,  and resumed
domesticity.

Explanations were difficult at this stage, and Leonard was too silly--or
it is tempting to write, too sound a chap to attempt them. His reticence
was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes, the
reticence that pretends that nothing is something, and hides behind
the Daily Telegraph. The adventurer, also, is reticent, and it is an
adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness. You may laugh
at him, you who have slept nights out on the veldt, with your rifle
beside you and all the atmosphere of adventure pat. And you also may
laugh who think adventures silly. But do not be surprised if Leonard is
shy whenever he meets you, and if the Schlegels rather than Jacky hear
about the dawn.

That the Schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent
joy. He was at his best when he thought of them. It buoyed him as he
journeyed home beneath fading heavens. Somehow the barriers of wealth
had fallen, and there had been--he could not phrase it--a general
assertion of the wonder of the world.  My conviction,  says the mystic,
 gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it,  and they
had agreed that there was something beyond life s daily grey. He took
off his top-hat and smoothed it thoughtfully. He had hitherto supposed
the unknown to be books, literature, clever conversation, culture. One
raised oneself by study, and got upsides with the world. But in that
quick interchange a new light dawned. Was that  something  walking in
the dark among the suburban hills?

He discovered that he was going bareheaded down Regent Street. London
came back with a rush. Few were about at this hour, but all whom he
passed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive
because it was unconscious. He put his hat on. It was too big; his head
disappeared like a pudding into a basin, the ears bending outwards at
the touch of the curly brim. He wore it a little backwards, and its
effect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance
between the eyes and the moustache. Thus equipped, he escaped criticism.
No one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements, the heart of a
man ticking fast in his chest.

",the mystery  like so many mysteries  was explained  next day  just as they were dressed to go out to dinner  a mr  bast called  he was a clerk in the employment of the porphyrion fire insurance

The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure, and when they
were both full of the same subject, there were few dinner-parties that
could stand up against them. This particular one, which was all ladies,
had more kick in it than most, but succumbed after a struggle. Helen at
one part of the table, Margaret at the other, would talk of Mr. Bast
and of no one else, and somewhere about the entree their monologues
collided, fell ruining, and became common property. Nor was this all.
The dinner-party was really an informal discussion club; there was a
paper after it, read amid coffee-cups and laughter in the drawing-room,
but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general
interest. After the paper came a debate, and in this debate Mr. Bast
also figured, appearing now as a bright spot in civilisation, now as a
dark spot, according to the temperament of the speaker. The subject of
the paper had been,  How ought I to dispose of my money?  the reader
professing to be a millionaire on the point of death, inclined to
bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries, but open
to conviction from other sources. The various parts had been assigned
beforehand, and some of the speeches were amusing. The hostess assumed
the ungrateful role of  the millionaire s eldest son,  and implored her
expiring parent not to dislocate Society by allowing such vast sums
to pass out of the family. Money was the fruit of self-denial, and the
second generation had a right to profit by the self-denial of the first.
What right had  Mr. Bast  to profit? The National Gallery was good
enough for the likes of him. After property had had its say--a saying
that is necessarily ungracious--the various philanthropists stepped
forward. Something must be done for  Mr. Bast ; his conditions must
be improved without impairing his independence; he must have a free
library, or free tennis-courts; his rent must be paid in such a way that
he did not know it was being paid; it must be made worth his while to
join the Territorials; he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring
wife, the money going to her as compensation; he must be assigned a
Twin Star, some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him
ceaselessly (groans from Helen); he must be given food but no clothes,
clothes but no food, a third-return ticket to Venice, without either
food or clothes when he arrived there. In short, he might be given
anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself.

And here Margaret interrupted.

 Order, order, Miss Schlegel!  said the reader of the paper.  You are
here, I understand, to advise me in the interests of the Society for the
Preservation of Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. I cannot
have you speaking out of your role. It makes my poor head go round, and
I think you forget that I am very ill. 

 Your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument,  said
Margaret.  Why not give him the money itself? You re supposed to have
about thirty thousand a year. 

 Have I? I thought I had a million. 

 Wasn t a million your capital? Dear me! we ought to have settled that.
Still, it doesn t matter. Whatever you ve got, I order you to give as
many poor men as you can three hundred a year each. 

 But that would be pauperising them,  said an earnest girl, who liked
the Schlegels, but thought them a little unspiritual at times.

 Not if you gave them so much. A big windfall would not pauperise a man.
It is these little driblets, distributed among too many, that do the
harm. Money s educational. It s far more educational than the things
it buys.  There was a protest.  In a sense,  added Margaret, but the
protest continued.  Well, isn t the most civilized thing going, the man
who has learnt to wear his income properly? 

 Exactly what your Mr. Basts won t do. 

 Give them a chance. Give them money. Don t dole them out poetry-books
and railway-tickets like babies. Give them the wherewithal to buy these
things. When your Socialism comes it may be different, and we may think
in terms of commodities instead of cash. Till it comes give people
cash, for it is the warp of civilisation, whatever the woof may be. The
imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly, for it s
the--the second most important thing in the world. It is so slurred over
and hushed up, there is so little clear thinking--oh, political economy,
of course, but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes,
and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the
result of independent means. Money: give Mr. Bast money, and don t
bother about his ideals. He ll pick up those for himself. 

She leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to
misconstrue her. The female mind, though cruelly practical in daily
life, cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation, and Miss
Schlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things, and what
it would profit Mr. Bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own
soul. She answered,  Nothing, but he would not gain his soul until
he had gained a little of the world.  Then they said,  No, we do not
believe it,  and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul
in the superterrestrial sense, where the effort will be taken for the
deed, but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources
of this world, will ever know the rarer joys of the body, or attain to
clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows. Others had attacked
the fabric of Society--Property, Interest, etc.; she only fixed her eyes
on a few human beings, to see how, under present conditions, they could
be made happier. Doing good to humanity was useless: the many-coloured
efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in
an universal grey. To do good to one, or, as in this case, to a few, was
the utmost she dare hope for.

Between the idealists, and the political economists, Margaret had a
bad time. Disagreeing elsewhere, they agreed in disowning her, and
in keeping the administration of the millionaire s money in their
own hands. The earnest girl brought forward a scheme of  personal
supervision and mutual help,  the effect of which was to alter poor
people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor. The
hostess pertinently remarked that she, as eldest son, might surely rank
among the millionaire s legatees. Margaret weakly admitted the claim,
and another claim was at once set up by Helen, who declared that she
had been the millionaire s housemaid for over forty years, overfed and
underpaid; was nothing to be done for her, so corpulent and poor? The
millionaire then read out her last will and testament, in which she left
the whole of her fortune to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Then she
died. The serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than
the playful--in a men s debate is the reverse more general?--but the
meeting broke up hilariously enough, and a dozen happy ladies dispersed
to their homes.

Helen and Margaret walked with the earnest girl as far as Battersea
Bridge Station, arguing copiously all the way. When she had gone
they were conscious of an alleviation, and of the great beauty of the
evening. They turned back towards Oakley Street. The lamps and the
plane-trees, following the line of the embankment, struck a note of
dignity that is rare in English cities. The seats, almost deserted, were
here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress, who had strolled
out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the
rising tide. There is something continental about Chelsea Embankment. It
is an open space used rightly, a blessing more frequent in Germany than
here. As Margaret and Helen sat down, the city behind them seemed to
be a vast theatre, an opera-house in which some endless trilogy was
performing, and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers, who did
not mind losing a little of the second act.

 Cold? 

 No. 

 Tired? 

 Doesn t matter. 

The earnest girl s train rumbled away over the bridge.

 I say, Helen-- 

 Well? 

 Are we really going to follow up Mr. Bast? 

 I don t know. 

 I think we won t. 

 As you like. 

 It s no good, I think, unless you really mean to know people. The
discussion brought that home to me. We got on well enough with him in a
spirit of excitement, but think of rational intercourse. We mustn t play
at friendship. No, it s no good. 

 There s Mrs. Lanoline, too,  Helen yawned.  So dull. 

 Just so, and possibly worse than dull. 

 I should like to know how he got hold of your card. 

 But he said--something about a concert and an umbrella. 

 Then did the card see the wife-- 

 Helen, come to bed. 

 No, just a little longer, it is so beautiful. Tell me; oh yes; did you
say money is the warp of the world? 

 Yes. 

 Then what s the woof? 

 Very much what one chooses,  said Margaret.  It s something that isn t
money--one can t say more. 

 Walking at night? 

 Probably. 

 For Tibby, Oxford? 

 It seems so. 

 For you? 

 Now that we have to leave Wickham Place, I begin to think it s that.
For Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End. 

One s own name will carry immense distances. Mr. Wilcox, who was sitting
with friends many seats away, heard this, rose to his feet, and strolled
along towards the speakers.

 It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than
people,  continued Margaret.

 Why, Meg? They re so much nicer generally. I d rather think of that
forester s house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who
lived in it. 

 I believe we shall come to care about people less and less, Helen. The
more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them. It s one
of the curses of London. I quite expect to end my life caring most for a
place. 

Here Mr. Wilcox reached them. It was several weeks since they had met.

 How do you do?  he cried.  I thought I recognised your voices. Whatever
are you both doing down here? 

His tones were protective. He implied that one ought not to sit out
on Chelsea Embankment without a male escort. Helen resented this, but
Margaret accepted it as part of the good man s equipment.

 What an age it is since I ve seen you, Mr. Wilcox. I met Evie in the
Tube, though, lately. I hope you have good news of your son. 

 Paul?  said Mr. Wilcox, extinguishing his cigarette, and sitting down
between them.  Oh, Paul s all right. We had a line from Madeira. He ll
be at work again by now. 

 Ugh--  said Helen, shuddering from complex causes.

 I beg your pardon? 

 Isn t the climate of Nigeria too horrible? 

 Some one s got to go,  he said simply.  England will never keep her
trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices. Unless we get
firm in West Africa, Ger--untold complications may follow. Now tell me
all your news. 

 Oh, we ve had a splendid evening,  cried Helen, who always woke up at
the advent of a visitor.  We belong to a kind of club that reads papers,
Margaret and I--all women, but there is a discussion after. This evening
it was on how one ought to leave one s money--whether to one s family,
or to the poor, and if so how--oh, most interesting. 

The man of business smiled. Since his wife s death he had almost doubled
his income. He was an important figure at last, a reassuring name on
company prospectuses, and life had treated him very well. The world
seemed in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames, which still
flowed inland from the sea. So wonderful to the girls, it held no
mysteries for him. He had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by
taking shares in the lock at Teddington, and if he and other capitalists
thought good, some day it could be shortened again. With a good dinner
inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank, he felt
that his hands were on all the ropes of life, and that what he did not
know could not be worth knowing.

 Sounds a most original entertainment!  he exclaimed, and laughed in
his pleasant way.  I wish Evie would go to that sort of thing. But she
hasn t the time. She s taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers--jolly little
dogs. 

 I expect we d better be doing the same, really. 

 We pretend we re improving ourselves, you see,  said Helen a little
sharply, for the Wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns, and she
had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made
would have impressed her favourably.  We suppose it a good thing to
waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate, but, as my sister says,
it may be better to breed dogs. 

 Not at all. I don t agree with your sister. There s nothing like a
debate to teach one quickness. I often wish I had gone in for them when
I was a youngster. It would have helped me no end. 

 Quickness--? 

 Yes. Quickness in argument. Time after time I ve missed scoring a point
because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I haven t. Oh, I
believe in these discussions. 

The patronising tone, thought Margaret, came well enough from a man who
was old enough to be their father. She had always maintained that Mr.
Wilcox had a charm. In times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had
pained her, but it was pleasant to listen to him now, and to watch his
thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars. But Helen
was nettled. The aim of their debates she implied was Truth.

 Oh yes, it doesn t much matter what subject you take,  said he.

Margaret laughed and said,  But this is going to be far better than the
debate itself.  Helen recovered herself and laughed too.  No, I won t go
on,  she declared.  I ll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox. 

 About Mr. Bast? Yes, do. He ll be more lenient to a special case. 

 But, Mr. Wilcox, do first light another cigarette. It s this. We ve
just come across a young fellow, who s evidently very poor, and who
seems interest-- 

 What s his profession? 

 Clerk. 

 What in? 

 Do you remember, Margaret? 

 Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. 

 Oh yes; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new hearth rug. He seems
interesting, in some ways very, and one wishes one could help him. He is
married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much. He likes books,
and what one may roughly call adventure, and if he had a chance--But he
is so poor. He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense
and clothes. One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong
for him and that he will sink. Well, he got mixed up in our debate. He
wasn t the subject of it, but it seemed to bear on his point. Suppose
a millionaire died, and desired to leave money to help such a man. How
should he be helped? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year
direct, which was Margaret s plan? Most of them thought this would
pauperise him. Should he and those like him be given free libraries?
I said  No!  He doesn t want more books to read, but to read books
rightly. My suggestion was he should be given something every year
towards a summer holiday, but then there is his wife, and they said she
would have to go too. Nothing seemed quite right! Now what do you think?
Imagine that you were a millionaire, and wanted to help the poor. What
would you do? 

Mr. Wilcox, whose fortune was not so very far below the standard
indicated, laughed exuberantly.  My dear Miss Schlegel, I will not rush
in where your sex has been unable to tread. I will not add another plan
to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested. My only
contribution is this: let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion
Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed. 

 Why?  said Margaret.

He lowered his voice.  This is between friends. It ll be in the
Receiver s hands before Christmas. It ll smash,  he added, thinking that
she had not understood.

 Dear me, Helen, listen to that. And he ll have to get another place! 

 WILL have? Let him leave the ship before it sinks. Let him get one
now. 

 Rather than wait, to make sure? 

 Decidedly. 

 Why s that? 

Again the Olympian laugh, and the lowered voice.  Naturally the man
who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance, is in a
stronger position, that the man who isn t. It looks as if he s worth
something. I know by myself--(this is letting you into the State
secrets)--it affects an employer greatly. Human nature, I m afraid. 

 I hadn t thought of that,  murmured Margaret, while Helen said,  Our
human nature appears to be the other way round. We employ people because
they re unemployed. The boot man, for instance. 

 And how does he clean the boots? 

 Not well,  confessed Margaret.

 There you are! 

 Then do you really advise us to tell this youth--? 

 I advise nothing,  he interrupted, glancing up and down the Embankment,
in case his indiscretion had been overheard.  I oughtn t to have
spoken--but I happen to know, being more or less behind the scenes. The
Porphyrion s a bad, bad concern--Now, don t say I said so. It s outside
the Tariff Ring. 

 Certainly I won t say. In fact, I don t know what that means. 

 I thought an insurance company never smashed,  was Helen s
contribution.  Don t the others always run in and save them? 

 You re thinking of reinsurance,  said Mr. Wilcox mildly.  It is exactly
there that the Porphyrion is weak. It has tried to undercut, has been
badly hit by a long series of small fires, and it hasn t been able to
reinsure. I m afraid that public companies don t save one another for
love. 

  Human nature,  I suppose,  quoted Helen, and he laughed and agreed
that it was. When Margaret said that she supposed that clerks, like
every one else, found it extremely difficult to get situations in these
days, he replied,  Yes, extremely,  and rose to rejoin his friends. He
knew by his own office--seldom a vacant post, and hundreds of applicants
for it; at present no vacant post.

 And how s Howards End looking?  said Margaret, wishing to change the
subject before they parted. Mr. Wilcox was a little apt to think one
wanted to get something out of him.

 It s let. 

 Really. And you wandering homeless in longhaired Chelsea? How strange
are the ways of Fate! 

 No; it s let unfurnished. We ve moved. 

 Why, I thought of you both as anchored there for ever. Evie never told
me. 

 I dare say when you met Evie the thing wasn t settled. We only moved
a week ago. Paul has rather a feeling for the old place, and we held on
for him to have his holiday there; but, really, it is impossibly small.
Endless drawbacks. I forget whether you ve been up to it? 

 As far as the house, never. 

 Well, Howards End is one of those converted farms. They don t really
do, spend what you will on them. We messed away with a garage all among
the wych-elm roots, and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and
attempted a rockery. Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants. But it
didn t do--no, it didn t do. You remember, your sister will remember,
the farm with those abominable guinea-fowls, and the hedge that the old
woman never would cut properly, so that it all went thin at the
bottom. And, inside the house, the beams--and the staircase through a
door--picturesque enough, but not a place to live in.  He glanced
over the parapet cheerfully.  Full tide. And the position wasn t right
either. The neighbourhood s getting suburban. Either be in London or out
of it, I say; so we ve taken a house in Ducie Street, close to Sloane
Street, and a place right down in Shropshire--Oniton Grange. Ever heard
of Oniton? Do come and see us--right away from everywhere, up towards
Wales. 

 What a change!  said Margaret. But the change was in her own voice,
which had become most sad.  I can t imagine Howards End or Hilton
without you. 

 Hilton isn t without us,  he replied.  Charles is there still. 

 Still?  said Margaret, who had not kept up with the Charles s.  But I
thought he was still at Epsom. They were furnishing that Christmas--one
Christmas. How everything alters! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our
windows very often. Wasn t it Epsom? 

 Yes, but they moved eighteen months ago. Charles, the good chap --his
voice dropped-- thought I should be lonely. I didn t want him to move,
but he would, and took a house at the other end of Hilton, down by
the Six Hills. He had a motor, too. There they all are, a very jolly
party--he and she and the two grandchildren. 

 I manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them
themselves,  said Margaret as they shook hands.  When you moved out of
Howards End, I should have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it. I should
have kept so remarkable a place in the family. 

 So it is,  he replied.  I haven t sold it, and don t mean to. 

 No; but none of you are there. 

 Oh, we ve got a splendid tenant--Hamar Bryce, an invalid. If
Charles ever wanted it--but he won t. Dolly is so dependent on modern
conveniences. No, we have all decided against Howards End. We like it in
a way, but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other. One
must have one thing or the other. 

 And some people are lucky enough to have both. You re doing yourself
proud, Mr. Wilcox. My congratulations. 

 And mine,  said Helen.

 Do remind Evie to come and see us--2 Wickham Place. We shan t be there
very long, either. 

 You, too, on the move? 

 Next September,  Margaret sighed.

 Every one moving! Good-bye. 

The tide had begun to ebb. Margaret leant over the parapet and watched
it sadly. Mr. Wilcox had forgotten his wife, Helen her lover; she
herself was probably forgetting. Every one moving. Is it worth while
attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts
of men?

Helen roused her by saying:  What a prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has
grown! I have very little use for him in these days. However, he did
tell us about the Porphyrion. Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever
we get home, and tell him to clear out of it at once. 

 Do; yes, that s worth doing. Let us. 

",the sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure  and when they were both full of the same subject  there were few dinner parties that could stand up against them  this particular one  which was all ladies  had more kick in it than most  but succumbed after a struggle  helen at one part of the table  margaret at the other  would talk of mr  bast and of no one else  and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided  fell ruining  and became common property  nor was this all  the dinner party was really an informal discussion club  there was a paper after it  read amid coffee cups and laughter in the drawing room  but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest  after the paper came a debate  and in this debate mr  bast also figured  appearing now as a bright spot in civilisation  now as a dark spot  according to the temperament of the speaker  the subject of the paper had been   how ought i to dispose of my money   the reader professing to be a millionaire on the point of death  inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries  but open to conviction from other sources  the various parts had been assigned beforehand  and some of the speeches were amusing  the hostess assumed the ungrateful role of  the millionaire s eldest son   and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate society by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family  money was the fruit of self denial  and the second generation had a right to profit by the self denial of the first  what right had  mr  bast  to profit  the national gallery was good enough for the likes of him  after property had had its say  a saying that is necessarily ungracious  the various philanthropists stepped forward  something must be done for  mr  bast   his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence  he must have a free library  or free tennis courts  his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was being paid  it must be made worth his while to join the territorials  he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife  the money going to her as compensation  he must be assigned a twin star  some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him ceaselessly  groans from helen   he must be given food but no clothes  clothes but no food  a third return ticket to venice  without either food or clothes when he arrived there  in short  he might be given anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself   and here margaret interrupted    order  order  miss schlegel   said the reader of the paper   you are here  i understand  to advise me in the interests of the society for the preservation of places of historic interest or natural beauty  i cannot have you speaking out of your role  it makes my poor head go round  and i think you forget that i am very ill     your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument   said margaret   why not give him the money itself  you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year     have i  i thought i had a million     wasn t a million your capital  dear me  we ought to have settled that  still  it doesn t matter  whatever you ve got  i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each     but that would be pauperising them   said an earnest girl  who liked the schlegels  but thought them a little unspiritual at times    not if you gave them so much  a big windfall would not pauperise a man  it is these little driblets  distributed among too many  that do the harm  money s educational  it s far more educational than the things it buys   there was a protest   in a sense   added margaret  but the protest continued   well  isn t the most civilized thing going  the man who has learnt to wear his income properly     exactly what your mr  basts won t do     give them a chance  give them money  don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies  give them the wherewithal to buy these things  when your socialism comes it may be different  and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash  till it comes give people cash  for it is the warp of civilisation  whatever the woof may be  the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly  for it s the  the second most important thing in the world  it is so slurred over and hushed up  there is so little clear thinking  oh  political economy  of course  but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes  and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means  money  give mr  bast money  and don t bother about his ideals  he ll pick up those for himself    she leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to misconstrue her  the female mind  though cruelly practical in daily life  cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation  and miss schlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things  and what it would profit mr  bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul  she answered   nothing  but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world   then they said   no  we do not believe it   and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense  where the effort will be taken for the deed  but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this world  will ever know the rarer joys of the body  or attain to clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows  others had attacked the fabric of society  property  interest  etc   she only fixed her eyes on a few human beings  to see how  under present conditions  they could be made happier  doing good to humanity was useless  the many coloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an universal grey  to do good to one  or  as in this case  to a few  was the utmost she dare hope for   between the idealists  and the political economists  margaret had a bad time  disagreeing elsewhere  they agreed in disowning her  and in keeping the administration of the millionaire s money in their own hands  the earnest girl brought forward a scheme of  personal supervision and mutual help   the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor  the hostess pertinently remarked that she  as eldest son  might surely rank among the millionaire s legatees  margaret weakly admitted the claim  and another claim was at once set up by helen  who declared that she had been the millionaire s housemaid for over forty years  overfed and underpaid  was nothing to be done for her  so corpulent and poor  the millionaire then read out her last will and testament  in which she left the whole of her fortune to the chancellor of the exchequer  then she died  the serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the playful  in a men s debate is the reverse more general   but the meeting broke up hilariously enough  and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes   helen and margaret walked with the earnest girl as far as battersea bridge station  arguing copiously all the way  when she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation  and of the great beauty of the evening  they turned back towards oakley street  the lamps and the plane trees  following the line of the embankment  struck a note of dignity that is rare in english cities  the seats  almost deserted  were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress  who had strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide  there is something continental about chelsea embankment  it is an open space used rightly  a blessing more frequent in germany than here  as margaret and helen sat down  the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre  an opera house in which some endless trilogy was performing  and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers  who did not mind losing a little of the second act    cold     no     tired     doesn t matter    the earnest girl s train rumbled away over the bridge    i say  helen      well     are we really going to follow up mr  bast     i don t know     i think we won t     as you like     it s no good  i think  unless you really mean to know people  the discussion brought that home to me  we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement  but think of rational intercourse  we mustn t play at friendship  no  it s no good     there s mrs  lanoline  too   helen yawned   so dull     just so  and possibly worse than dull     i should like to know how he got hold of your card     but he said  something about a concert and an umbrella     then did the card see the wife      helen  come to bed     no  just a little longer  it is so beautiful  tell me  oh yes  did you say money is the warp of the world     yes     then what s the woof     very much what one chooses   said margaret   it s something that isn t money  one can t say more     walking at night     probably     for tibby  oxford     it seems so     for you     now that we have to leave wickham place  i begin to think it s that  for mrs  wilcox it was certainly howards end    one s own name will carry immense distances  mr  wilcox  who was sitting with friends many seats away  heard this  rose to his feet  and strolled along towards the speakers    it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people   continued margaret    why  meg  they re so much nicer generally  i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it     i believe we shall come to care about people less and less  helen  the more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them  it s one of the curses of london  i quite expect to end my life caring most for a place    here mr  wilcox reached them  it was several weeks since they had met    how do you do   he cried   i thought i recognised your voices  whatever are you both doing down here    his tones were protective  he implied that one ought not to sit out on chelsea embankment without a male escort  helen resented this  but margaret accepted it as part of the good man s equipment    what an age it is since i ve seen you  mr  wilcox  i met evie in the tube  though  lately  i hope you have good news of your son     paul   said mr  wilcox  extinguishing his cigarette  and sitting down between them   oh  paul s all right  we had a line from madeira  he ll be at work again by now     ugh    said helen  shuddering from complex causes    i beg your pardon     isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible     some one s got to go   he said simply   england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices  unless we get firm in west africa  ger  untold complications may follow  now tell me all your news     oh  we ve had a splendid evening   cried helen  who always woke up at the advent of a visitor   we belong to a kind of club that reads papers  margaret and i  all women  but there is a discussion after  this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money  whether to one s family  or to the poor  and if so how  oh  most interesting    the man of business smiled  since his wife s death he had almost doubled his income  he was an important figure at last  a reassuring name on company prospectuses  and life had treated him very well  the world seemed in his grasp as he listened to the river thames  which still flowed inland from the sea  so wonderful to the girls  it held no mysteries for him  he had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at teddington  and if he and other capitalists thought good  some day it could be shortened again  with a good dinner inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank  he felt that his hands were on all the ropes of life  and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing    sounds a most original entertainment   he exclaimed  and laughed in his pleasant way   i wish evie would go to that sort of thing  but she hasn t the time  she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers  jolly little dogs     i expect we d better be doing the same  really     we pretend we re improving ourselves  you see   said helen a little sharply  for the wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns  and she had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made would have impressed her favourably   we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate  but  as my sister says  it may be better to breed dogs     not at all  i don t agree with your sister  there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness  i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster  it would have helped me no end     quickness       yes  quickness in argument  time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t  oh  i believe in these discussions    the patronising tone  thought margaret  came well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father  she had always maintained that mr  wilcox had a charm  in times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her  but it was pleasant to listen to him now  and to watch his thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars  but helen was nettled  the aim of their debates she implied was truth    oh yes  it doesn t much matter what subject you take   said he   margaret laughed and said   but this is going to be far better than the debate itself   helen recovered herself and laughed too   no  i won t go on   she declared   i ll just put our special case to mr  wilcox     about mr  bast  yes  do  he ll be more lenient to a special case     but  mr  wilcox  do first light another cigarette  it s this  we ve just come across a young fellow  who s evidently very poor  and who seems interest      what s his profession     clerk     what in     do you remember  margaret     porphyrion fire insurance company     oh yes  the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug  he seems interesting  in some ways very  and one wishes one could help him  he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much  he likes books  and what one may roughly call adventure  and if he had a chance  but he is so poor  he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes  one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink  well  he got mixed up in our debate  he wasn t the subject of it  but it seemed to bear on his point  suppose a millionaire died  and desired to leave money to help such a man  how should he be helped  should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct  which was margaret s plan  most of them thought this would pauperise him  should he and those like him be given free libraries  i said  no   he doesn t want more books to read  but to read books rightly  my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday  but then there is his wife  and they said she would have to go too  nothing seemed quite right  now what do you think  imagine that you were a millionaire  and wanted to help the poor  what would you do    mr  wilcox  whose fortune was not so very far below the standard indicated  laughed exuberantly   my dear miss schlegel  i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread  i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested  my only contribution is this  let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed     why   said margaret   he lowered his voice   this is between friends  it ll be in the receiver s hands before christmas  it ll smash   he added  thinking that she had not understood    dear me  helen  listen to that  and he ll have to get another place     will have  let him leave the ship before it sinks  let him get one now     rather than wait  to make sure     decidedly     why s that    again the olympian laugh  and the lowered voice   naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance  is in a stronger position  that the man who isn t  it looks as if he s worth something  i know by myself   this is letting you into the state secrets   it affects an employer greatly  human nature  i m afraid     i hadn t thought of that   murmured margaret  while helen said   our human nature appears to be the other way round  we employ people because they re unemployed  the boot man  for instance     and how does he clean the boots     not well   confessed margaret    there you are     then do you really advise us to tell this youth       i advise nothing   he interrupted  glancing up and down the embankment  in case his indiscretion had been overheard   i oughtn t to have spoken  but i happen to know  being more or less behind the scenes  the porphyrion s a bad  bad concern  now  don t say i said so  it s outside the tariff ring     certainly i won t say  in fact  i don t know what that means     i thought an insurance company never smashed   was helen s contribution   don t the others always run in and save them     you re thinking of reinsurance   said mr  wilcox mildly   it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak  it has tried to undercut  has been badly hit by a long series of small fires  and it hasn t been able to reinsure  i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love      human nature   i suppose   quoted helen  and he laughed and agreed that it was  when margaret said that she supposed that clerks  like every one else  found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days  he replied   yes  extremely   and rose to rejoin his friends  he knew by his own office  seldom a vacant post  and hundreds of applicants for it  at present no vacant post    and how s howards end looking   said margaret  wishing to change the subject before they parted  mr  wilcox was a little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him    it s let     really  and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea  how strange are the ways of fate     no  it s let unfurnished  we ve moved     why  i thought of you both as anchored there for ever  evie never told me     i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled  we only moved a week ago  paul has rather a feeling for the old place  and we held on for him to have his holiday there  but  really  it is impossibly small  endless drawbacks  i forget whether you ve been up to it     as far as the house  never     well  howards end is one of those converted farms  they don t really do  spend what you will on them  we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots  and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery  evie got rather keen on alpine plants  but it didn t do  no  it didn t do  you remember  your sister will remember  the farm with those abominable guinea fowls  and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly  so that it all went thin at the bottom  and  inside the house  the beams  and the staircase through a door  picturesque enough  but not a place to live in   he glanced over the parapet cheerfully   full tide  and the position wasn t right either  the neighbourhood s getting suburban  either be in london or out of it  i say  so we ve taken a house in ducie street  close to sloane street  and a place right down in shropshire  oniton grange  ever heard of oniton  do come and see us  right away from everywhere  up towards wales     what a change   said margaret  but the change was in her own voice  which had become most sad   i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you     hilton isn t without us   he replied   charles is there still     still   said margaret  who had not kept up with the charles s   but i thought he was still at epsom  they were furnishing that christmas  one christmas  how everything alters  i used to admire mrs  charles from our windows very often  wasn t it epsom     yes  but they moved eighteen months ago  charles  the good chap   his voice dropped   thought i should be lonely  i didn t want him to move  but he would  and took a house at the other end of hilton  down by the six hills  he had a motor  too  there they all are  a very jolly party  he and she and the two grandchildren     i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves   said margaret as they shook hands   when you moved out of howards end  i should have moved mr  charles wilcox into it  i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family     so it is   he replied   i haven t sold it  and don t mean to     no  but none of you are there     oh  we ve got a splendid tenant  hamar bryce  an invalid  if charles ever wanted it  but he won t  dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences  no  we have all decided against howards end  we like it in a way  but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other  one must have one thing or the other     and some people are lucky enough to have both  you re doing yourself proud  mr  wilcox  my congratulations     and mine   said helen    do remind evie to come and see us    wickham place  we shan t be there very long  either     you  too  on the move     next september   margaret sighed    every one moving  good bye    the tide had begun to ebb  margaret leant over the parapet and watched it sadly  mr  wilcox had forgotten his wife  helen her lover  she herself was probably forgetting  every one moving  is it worth while attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men   helen roused her by saying   what a prosperous vulgarian mr  wilcox has grown  i have very little use for him in these days  however  he did tell us about the porphyrion  let us write to mr  bast as soon as ever we get home  and tell him to clear out of it at once     do  yes  that s worth doing  let

15,15,3304,3475,3646,"

Leonard accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday. But he was right;
the visit proved a conspicuous failure.

 Sugar?  said Margaret.

 Cake?  said Helen.  The big cake or the little deadlies? I m afraid
you thought my letter rather odd, but we ll explain--we aren t odd,
really--nor affected, really. We re over-expressive--that s all. 

As a lady s lap-dog Leonard did not excel. He was not an Italian,
still less a Frenchman, in whose blood there runs the very spirit of
persiflage and of gracious repartee. His wit was the Cockney s; it
opened no doors into imagination, and Helen was drawn up short by  The
more a lady has to say, the better,  administered waggishly.

 Oh yes,  she said.

 Ladies brighten-- 

 Yes, I know. The darlings are regular sunbeams. Let me give you a
plate. 

 How do you like your work?  interposed Margaret.

He, too, was drawn up short. He would not have these women prying into
his work. They were Romance, and so was the room to which he had at last
penetrated, with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls,
and so were the very tea-cups, with their delicate borders of wild
strawberries. But he would not let romance interfere with his life.
There is the devil to pay then.

 Oh, well enough,  he answered.

 Your company is the Porphyrion, isn t it? 

 Yes, that s so. --becoming rather offended.  It s funny how things get
round. 

 Why funny?  asked Helen, who did not follow the workings of his mind.
 It was written as large as life on your card, and considering we wrote
to you there, and that you replied on the stamped paper-- 

 Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance Companies? 
 pursued Margaret.

 It depends on what you call big. 

 I mean by big, a solid, well-established concern, that offers a
reasonably good career to its employes. 

 I couldn t say--some would tell you one thing and others another,  said
the employee uneasily.  For my own part --he shook his head-- I only
believe half I hear. Not that even; it s safer. Those clever ones come
to the worse grief, I ve often noticed. Ah, you can t be too careful. 

He drank, and wiped his moustache, which was going to be one of those
moustaches that always droop into tea-cups--more bother than they re
worth, surely, and not fashionable either.

 I quite agree, and that s why I was curious to know; is it a solid,
well-established concern? 

Leonard had no idea. He understood his own corner of the machine,
but nothing beyond it. He desired to confess neither knowledge nor
ignorance, and under these circumstances, another motion of the head
seemed safest. To him, as to the British public, the Porphyrion was the
Porphyrion of the advertisement--a giant, in the classical style, but
draped sufficiently, who held in one hand a burning torch, and pointed
with the other to St. Paul s and Windsor Castle. A large sum of money
was inscribed below, and you drew your own conclusions. This giant
caused Leonard to do arithmetic and write letters, to explain the
regulations to new clients, and re-explain them to old ones. A giant
was of an impulsive morality--one knew that much. He would pay for
Mrs. Munt s hearthrug with ostentatious haste, a large claim he would
repudiate quietly, and fight court by court. But his true fighting
weight, his antecedents, his amours with other members of the commercial
Pantheon--all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the
escapades of Zeus. While the gods are powerful, we learn little about
them. It is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light
beats into heaven.

 We were told the Porphyrion s no go,  blurted Helen.  We wanted to tell
you; that s why we wrote. 

 A friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured,  said
Margaret.

Now Leonard had his clue.

He must praise the Porphyrion.  You can tell your friend,  he said,
 that he s quite wrong. 

 Oh, good! 

The young man coloured a little. In his circle to be wrong was fatal.
The Miss Schlegels did not mind being wrong. They were genuinely glad
that they had been misinformed. To them nothing was fatal but evil.

 Wrong, so to speak,  he added.

 How  so to speak ? 

 I mean I wouldn t say he s right altogether. 

But this was a blunder.  Then he is right partly,  said the elder woman,
quick as lightning.

Leonard replied that every one was right partly, if it came to that.

 Mr. Bast, I don t understand business, and I dare say my questions are
stupid, but can you tell me what makes a concern  right  or  wrong ? 

Leonard sat back with a sigh.

 Our friend, who is also a business man, was so positive. He said before
Christmas-- 

 And advised you to clear out of it,  concluded Helen.  But I don t see
why he should know better than you do. 

Leonard rubbed his hands. He was tempted to say that he knew nothing
about the thing at all. But a commercial training was too strong for
him. Nor could he say it was a bad thing, for this would be giving
it away; nor yet that it was good, for this would be giving it away
equally. He attempted to suggest that it was something between the two,
with vast possibilities in either direction, but broke down under the
gaze of four sincere eyes. And yet he scarcely distinguished between
the two sisters. One was more beautiful and more lively, but  the Miss
Schlegels  still remained a composite Indian god, whose waving arms and
contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind.

 One can but see,  he remarked, adding,  as Ibsen says,  things
happen.   He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his
romantic hour. Minute after minute slipped away, while the ladies, with
imperfect skill, discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their
anonymous friend. Leonard grew annoyed--perhaps rightly. He made vague
remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being
talked over by others, but they did not take the hint. Men might have
shown more tact. Women, however tactful elsewhere, are heavy-handed
here. They cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects
in a veil.  How much exactly have you, and how much do you expect to
have next June?  And these were women with a theory, who held that
reticence about money matters is absurd, and that life would be truer
if each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he
stands, the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is
not money. How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise?

And the precious minutes slipped away, and Jacky and squalor came
nearer. At last he could bear it no longer, and broke in, reciting
the names of books feverishly. There was a moment of piercing joy when
Margaret said,  So YOU like Carlyle  and then the door opened, and  Mr.
Wilcox, Miss Wilcox  entered, preceded by two prancing puppies.

 Oh, the dears! Oh, Evie, how too impossibly sweet!  screamed Helen,
falling on her hands and knees.

 We brought the little fellows round,  said Mr. Wilcox.

 I bred  em myself. 

 Oh, really! Mr. Bast, come and play with puppies. 

 I ve got to be going now,  said Leonard sourly.

 But play with puppies a little first. 

 This is Ahab, that s Jezebel,  said Evie, who was one of those who name
animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history.

 I ve got to be going. 

Helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him.

 Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Ba--Must you be really? Good-bye! 

 Come again,  said Helen from the floor.

Then Leonard s gorge arose. Why should he come again? What was the good
of it? He said roundly:  No, I shan t; I knew it would be a failure. 

Most people would have let him go.  A little mistake. We tried knowing
another class--impossible. 

But the Schlegels had never played with life. They had attempted
friendship, and they would take the consequences. Helen retorted,  I
call that a very rude remark. What do you want to turn on me like that
for?  and suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row.

 You ask me why I turn on you? 

 Yes. 

 What do you want to have me here for? 

 To help you, you silly boy!  cried Helen.  And don t shout. 

 I don t want your patronage. I don t want your tea. I was quite happy.
What do you want to unsettle me for?  He turned to Mr. Wilcox.  I put it
to this gentleman. I ask you, sir, am I to have my brain picked? 

Mr. Wilcox turned to Margaret with the air of humorous strength that he
could so well command.  Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel? Can we be of
any use, or shall we go? 

But Margaret ignored him.

 I m connected with a leading insurance company, sir. I receive what I
take to be an invitation from these--ladies  (he drawled the word).  I
come, and it s to have my brain picked. I ask you, is it fair? 

 Highly unfair,  said Mr. Wilcox, drawing a gasp from Evie, who knew
that her father was becoming dangerous.

 There, you hear that? Most unfair, the gentleman says. There! Not
content with --pointing at Margaret-- you can t deny it.  His voice
rose; he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with Jacky.  But as
soon as I m useful it s a very different thing.  Oh yes, send for him.
Cross-question him. Pick his brains.  Oh yes. Now, take me on the whole,
I m a quiet fellow: I m law-abiding, I don t wish any unpleasantness;
but I--I-- 

 You,  said Margaret-- you--you-- 

Laughter from Evie as at a repartee.

 You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star. 

More laughter.

 You saw the sunrise. 

Laughter.

 You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all--away past
books and houses to the truth. You were looking for a real home. 

 I fail to see the connection,  said Leonard, hot with stupid anger.

 So do I.  There was a pause.  You were that last Sunday--you are this
to-day. Mr. Bast! I and my sister have talked you over. We wanted to
help you; we also supposed you might help us. We did not have you here
out of charity--which bores us--but because we hoped there would be a
connection between last Sunday and other days. What is the good of your
stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into
our daily lives? They have never entered into mine, but into yours,
we thought--Haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness,
against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion?
I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering
some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you one of these. 

 Of course, if there s been any misunderstanding,  mumbled Leonard,  all
I can do is to go. But I beg to state--  He paused. Ahab and Jezebel
danced at his boots and made him look ridiculous.  You were picking my
brain for official information--I can prove it--I--  He blew his nose
and left them.

 Can I help you now?  said Mr. Wilcox, turning to Margaret.  May I have
one quiet word with him in the hall? 

 Helen, go after him--do anything--anything--to make the noodle
understand. 

Helen hesitated.

 But really--  said their visitor.  Ought she to? 

At once she went.

He resumed.  I would have chimed in, but I felt that you could polish
him off for yourselves--I didn t interfere. You were splendid, Miss
Schlegel--absolutely splendid. You can take my word for it, but there
are very few women who could have managed him. 

 Oh yes,  said Margaret distractedly.

 Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me,  cried
Evie.

 Yes, indeed,  chuckled her father;  all that part about  mechanical
cheerfulness --oh, fine! 

 I m very sorry,  said Margaret, collecting herself.  He s a nice
creature really. I cannot think what set him off. It has been most
unpleasant for you. 

 Oh, I didn t mind.  Then he changed his mood. He asked if he might
speak as an old friend, and, permission given, said:  Oughtn t you
really to be more careful? 

Margaret laughed, though her thoughts still strayed after Helen.  Do you
realise that it s all your fault?  she said.  You re responsible. 

 I? 

 This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion. We
warn him, and--look! 

Mr. Wilcox was annoyed.  I hardly consider that a fair deduction,  he
said.

 Obviously unfair,  said Margaret.  I was only thinking how tangled
things are. It s our fault mostly--neither yours nor his. 

 Not his? 

 No. 

 Miss Schlegel, you are too kind. 

 Yes, indeed,  nodded Evie, a little contemptuously.

 You behave much too well to people, and then they impose on you. I know
the world and that type of man, and as soon as I entered the room I saw
you had not been treating him properly. You must keep that type at a
distance. Otherwise they forget themselves. Sad, but true. They aren t
our sort, and one must face the fact. 

 Ye--es. 

 Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a
gentleman. 

 I admit it willingly,  said Margaret, who was pacing up and down the
room.  A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself. 

Mr. Wilcox watched her with a vague uneasiness.

 What did he suspect you of? 

 Of wanting to make money out of him. 

 Intolerable brute! But how were you to benefit? 

 Exactly. How indeed! Just horrible, corroding suspicion. One touch of
thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away. Just the senseless
fear that does make men intolerable brutes. 

 I come back to my original point. You ought to be more careful, Miss
Schlegel. Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in. 

She turned to him frankly.  Let me explain exactly why we like this man,
and want to see him again. 

 That s your clever way of talking. I shall never believe you like him. 

 I do. Firstly, because he cares for physical adventure, just as you
do. Yes, you go motoring and shooting; he would like to go camping out.
Secondly, he cares for something special IN adventure. It is quickest to
call that special something poetry-- 

 Oh, he s one of that writer sort. 

 No--oh no! I mean he may be, but it would be loathsome stuff. His brain
is filled with the husks of books, culture--horrible; we want him to
wash out his brain and go to the real thing. We want to show him how
he may get upsides with life. As I said, either friends or the country,
some --she hesitated-- either some very dear person or some very dear
place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey, and to show that it
is grey. If possible, one should have both. 

Some of her words ran past Mr. Wilcox. He let them run past. Others he
caught and criticised with admirable lucidity.

 Your mistake is this, and it is a very common mistake. This young
bounder has a life of his own. What right have you to conclude it is an
unsuccessful life, or, as you call it,  grey ? 

 Because-- 

 One minute. You know nothing about him. He probably has his own
joys and interests--wife, children, snug little home. That s where we
practical fellows  he smiled-- are more tolerant than you intellectuals.
We live and let live, and assume that things are jogging on fairly well
elsewhere, and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after
his own affairs. I quite grant--I look at the faces of the clerks in my
own office, and observe them to be dull, but I don t know what s going
on beneath. So, by the way, with London. I have heard you rail against
London, Miss Schlegel, and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very
angry with you. What do you know about London? You only see civilisation
from the outside. I don t say in your case, but in too many cases that
attitude leads to morbidity, discontent, and Socialism. 

She admitted the strength of his position, though it undermined
imagination. As he spoke, some outposts of poetry and perhaps of
sympathy fell ruining, and she retreated to what she called her  second
line --to the special facts of the case.

 His wife is an old bore,  she said simply.  He never came home last
Saturday night because he wanted to be alone, and she thought he was
with us. 

 With YOU? 

 Yes.  Evie tittered.  He hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed. He
needs outside interests. 

 Naughty young man!  cried the girl.

 Naughty?  said Margaret, who hated naughtiness more than sin.  When
you re married Miss Wilcox, won t you want outside interests? 

 He has apparently got them,  put in Mr. Wilcox slyly.

 Yes, indeed, father. 

 He was tramping in Surrey, if you mean that,  said Margaret, pacing
away rather crossly.

 Oh, I dare say! 

 Miss Wilcox, he was! 

 M--m--m--m!  from Mr. Wilcox, who thought the episode amusing, if
risque. With most ladies he would not have discussed it, but he was
trading on Margaret s reputation as an emancipated woman.

 He said so, and about such a thing he wouldn t lie. 

They both began to laugh.

 That s where I differ from you. Men lie about their positions and
prospects, but not about a thing of that sort. 

He shook his head.  Miss Schlegel, excuse me, but I know the type. 

 I said before--he isn t a type. He cares about adventures rightly. He s
certain that our smug existence isn t all. He s vulgar and hysterical
and bookish, but don t think that sums him up. There s manhood in him as
well. Yes, that s what I m trying to say. He s a real man. 

As she spoke their eyes met, and it was as if Mr. Wilcox s defences
fell. She saw back to the real man in him. Unwittingly she had touched
his emotions.

A woman and two men--they had formed the magic triangle of sex, and
the male was thrilled to jealousy, in case the female was attracted by
another male. Love, say the ascetics, reveals our shameful kinship with
the beasts. Be it so: one can bear that; jealousy is the real shame. It
is jealousy, not love, that connects us with the farmyard intolerably,
and calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen. Margaret
crushed complacency down because she was civilised. Mr. Wilcox,
uncivilised, continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his
defences, and was again presenting a bastion to the world.

 Miss Schlegel, you re a pair of dear creatures, but you really MUST be
careful in this uncharitable world. What does your brother say? 

 I forget. 

 Surely he has some opinion? 

 He laughs, if I remember correctly. 

 He s very clever, isn t he?  said Evie, who had met and detested Tibby
at Oxford.

 Yes, pretty well--but I wonder what Helen s doing. 

 She is very young to undertake this sort of thing,  said Mr. Wilcox.

Margaret went out to the landing. She heard no sound, and Mr. Bast s
topper was missing from the hall.

 Helen!  she called.

 Yes!  replied a voice from the library.

 You in there? 

 Yes--he s gone some time. 

Margaret went to her.  Why, you re all alone,  she said.

 Yes--it s all right, Meg. Poor, poor creature-- 

 Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later--Mr. W much concerned, and
slightly titillated. 

 Oh, I ve no patience with him. I hate him. Poor dear Mr. Bast! he
wanted to talk literature, and we would talk business. Such a muddle of
a man, and yet so worth pulling through. I like him extraordinarily. 

 Well done,  said Margaret, kissing her,  but come into the drawing-room
now, and don t talk about him to the Wilcoxes. Make light of the whole
thing. 

Helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their
visitor--this hen at all events was fancy-free.

 He s gone with my blessing,  she cried,  and now for puppies. 

As they drove away, Mr. Wilcox said to his daughter:

 I am really concerned at the way those girls go on. They are as clever
as you make  em, but unpractical--God bless me! One of these days
they ll go too far. Girls like that oughtn t to live alone in London.
Until they marry, they ought to have some one to look after them. We
must look in more often--we re better than no one. You like them, don t
you, Evie? 

Evie replied:  Helen s right enough, but I can t stand the toothy one.
And I shouldn t have called either of them girls. 

Evie had grown up handsome. Dark-eyed, with the glow of youth under
sunburn, built firmly and firm-lipped, she was the best the Wilcoxes
could do in the way of feminine beauty. For the present, puppies and
her father were the only things she loved, but the net of matrimony was
being prepared for her, and a few days later she was attracted to a Mr.
Percy Cahill, an uncle of Mrs. Charles s, and he was attracted to her.

",leonard accepted the invitation to tea next saturday  but he was right  the visit proved a conspicuous failure    sugar   said margaret    cake   said helen   the big cake or the little deadlies  i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd  but we ll explain  we aren t odd  really  nor affected  really  we re over expressive  that s all    as a lady s lap dog leonard did not excel  he was not an italian  still less a frenchman  in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious repartee  his wit was the cockney s  it opened no doors into imagination  and helen was drawn up short by  the more a lady has to say  the better   administered waggishly    oh yes   she said    ladies brighten      yes  i know  the darlings are regular sunbeams  let me give you a plate     how do you like your work   interposed margaret   he  too  was drawn up short  he would not have these women prying into his work  they were romance  and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated  with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls  and so were the very tea cups  with their delicate borders of wild strawberries  but he would not let romance interfere with his life  there is the devil to pay then    oh  well enough   he answered    your company is the porphyrion  isn t it     yes  that s so    becoming rather offended   it s funny how things get round     why funny   asked helen  who did not follow the workings of his mind   it was written as large as life on your card  and considering we wrote to you there  and that you replied on the stamped paper      would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies    pursued margaret    it depends on what you call big     i mean by big  a solid  well established concern  that offers a reasonably good career to its employes     i couldn t say  some would tell you one thing and others another   said the employee uneasily   for my own part   he shook his head   i only believe half i hear  not that even  it s safer  those clever ones come to the worse grief  i ve often noticed  ah  you can t be too careful    he drank  and wiped his moustache  which was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into tea cups  more bother than they re worth  surely  and not fashionable either    i quite agree  and that s why i was curious to know  is it a solid  well established concern    leonard had no idea  he understood his own corner of the machine  but nothing beyond it  he desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance  and under these circumstances  another motion of the head seemed safest  to him  as to the british public  the porphyrion was the porphyrion of the advertisement  a giant  in the classical style  but draped sufficiently  who held in one hand a burning torch  and pointed with the other to st  paul s and windsor castle  a large sum of money was inscribed below  and you drew your own conclusions  this giant caused leonard to do arithmetic and write letters  to explain the regulations to new clients  and re explain them to old ones  a giant was of an impulsive morality  one knew that much  he would pay for mrs  munt s hearthrug with ostentatious haste  a large claim he would repudiate quietly  and fight court by court  but his true fighting weight  his antecedents  his amours with other members of the commercial pantheon  all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of zeus  while the gods are powerful  we learn little about them  it is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven    we were told the porphyrion s no go   blurted helen   we wanted to tell you  that s why we wrote     a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured   said margaret   now leonard had his clue   he must praise the porphyrion   you can tell your friend   he said   that he s quite wrong     oh  good    the young man coloured a little  in his circle to be wrong was fatal  the miss schlegels did not mind being wrong  they were genuinely glad that they had been misinformed  to them nothing was fatal but evil    wrong  so to speak   he added    how  so to speak      i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether    but this was a blunder   then he is right partly   said the elder woman  quick as lightning   leonard replied that every one was right partly  if it came to that    mr  bast  i don t understand business  and i dare say my questions are stupid  but can you tell me what makes a concern  right  or  wrong     leonard sat back with a sigh    our friend  who is also a business man  was so positive  he said before christmas      and advised you to clear out of it   concluded helen   but i don t see why he should know better than you do    leonard rubbed his hands  he was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all  but a commercial training was too strong for him  nor could he say it was a bad thing  for this would be giving it away  nor yet that it was good  for this would be giving it away equally  he attempted to suggest that it was something between the two  with vast possibilities in either direction  but broke down under the gaze of four

angry with you  what do you know about london  you only see civilisation from the outside  i don t say in your case  but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity  discontent  and socialism    she admitted the strength of his position  though it undermined imagination  as he spoke  some outposts of poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining  and she retreated to what she called her

not have discussed it  but he was trading on margaret s reputation as an emancipated woman    he said so  and about such a thing he wouldn t lie    they both began to laugh    that s where i differ from you  men lie about their positions and prospects  but not about a thing of that sort    he shook his head   miss schlegel  excuse me  but i know the type     i said before  he isn t a type  he cares about adventures rightly  he s certain that our smug existence isn t all  he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish  but don t think that sums him up  there s manhood in him as well  yes  that s what i m trying to say  he s a real man    as she spoke their eyes met  and it was as if mr  wilcox s defences fell  she saw back to the real man in him  unwittingly she had touched his emotions   a woman and two men  they had formed the magic triangle of sex  and the male was thrilled to jealousy  in case the female was attracted by another male  love  say the ascetics  reveals our shameful kinship with the beasts  be it so  one can bear that  jealousy is the real shame  it is jealousy  not love  that connects us with the farmyard intolerably  and calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen  margaret crushed complacency down because she was civilised  mr  wilcox  uncivilised  continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his defences  and was again presenting a

The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor. When
a move is imminent, furniture becomes ridiculous, and Margaret now
lay awake at nights wondering where, where on earth they and all
their belongings would be deposited in September next. Chairs, tables,
pictures, books, that had rumbled down to them through the generations,
must rumble forward again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to
give the final push, and send toppling into the sea. But there were
all their father s books--they never read them, but they were
their father s, and must be kept. There was the marble-topped
chiffonier--their mother had set store by it, they could not remember
why. Round every knob and cushion in the house gathered a sentiment
that was at times personal, but more often a faint piety to the dead, a
prolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave.

It was absurd, if you came to think of it; Helen and Tibby came to think
of it; Margaret was too busy with the house-agents. The feudal ownership
of land did bring dignity, whereas the modern ownership of movables
is reducing us again to a nomadic horde. We are reverting to the
civilisation of luggage, and historians of the future will note how the
middle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth,
and may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty. The
Schlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of Wickham Place. It
had helped to balance their lives, and almost to counsel them. Nor is
their ground-landlord spiritually the richer. He has built flats on
its site, his motor-cars grow swifter, his exposures of Socialism more
trenchant. But he has spilt the precious distillation of the years, and
no chemistry of his can give it back to society again.

Margaret grew depressed; she was anxious to settle on a house before
they left town to pay their annual visit to Mrs. Munt. She enjoyed this
visit, and wanted to have her mind at ease for it. Swanage, though dull,
was stable, and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air
and for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north. But London
thwarted her; in its atmosphere she could not concentrate. London only
stimulates, it cannot sustain; and Margaret, hurrying over its surface
for a house without knowing what sort of a house she wanted, was paying
for many a thrilling sensation in the past. She could not even break
loose from culture, and her time was wasted by concerts which it would
be a sin to miss, and invitations which it would never do to refuse. At
last she grew desperate; she resolved that she would go nowhere and be
at home to no one until she found a house, and broke the resolution in
half an hour.

Once she had humorously lamented that she had never been to Simpson s
restaurant in the Strand. Now a note arrived from Miss Wilcox, asking
her to lunch there. Mr Cahill was coming and the three would have such a
jolly chat, and perhaps end up at the Hippodrome. Margaret had no strong
regard for Evie, and no desire to meet her fiance, and she was surprised
that Helen, who had been far funnier about Simpson s, had not been asked
instead. But the invitation touched her by its intimate tone. She
must know Evie Wilcox better than she supposed, and declaring that she
 simply must,  she accepted.

But when she saw Evie at the entrance of the restaurant, staring
fiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic women, her heart
failed her anew. Miss Wilcox had changed perceptibly since her
engagement. Her voice was gruffer, her manner more downright, and she
was inclined to patronise the more foolish virgin. Margaret was silly
enough to be pained at this. Depressed at her isolation, she saw not
only houses and furniture, but the vessel of life itself slipping past
her, with people like Evie and Mr. Cahill on board.

There are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us, and one of them came
to her at Simpson s in the Strand. As she trod the staircase, narrow,
but carpeted thickly, as she entered the eating-room, where saddles of
mutton were being trundled up to expectant clergymen, she had a strong,
if erroneous, conviction of her own futility, and wished she had never
come out of her backwater, where nothing happened except art and
literature, and where no one ever got married or succeeded in
remaining engaged. Then came a little surprise.  Father might be of the
party--yes, father was.  With a smile of pleasure she moved forward to
greet him, and her feeling of loneliness vanished.

 I thought I d get round if I could,  said he.  Evie told me of her
little plan, so I just slipped in and secured a table. Always secure
a table first. Evie, don t pretend you want to sit by your old father,
because you don t. Miss Schlegel, come in my side, out of pity. My
goodness, but you look tired! Been worrying round after your young
clerks? 

 No, after houses,  said Margaret, edging past him into the box.  I m
hungry, not tired; I want to eat heaps. 

 That s good. What ll you have? 

 Fish pie,  said she, with a glance at the menu.

 Fish pie! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson s. It s not a bit the
thing to go for here. 

 Go for something for me, then,  said Margaret, pulling off her gloves.
Her spirits were rising, and his reference to Leonard Bast had warmed
her curiously.

 Saddle of mutton,  said he after profound reflection;  and cider to
drink. That s the type of thing. I like this place, for a joke, once in
a way. It is so thoroughly Old English. Don t you agree? 

 Yes,  said Margaret, who didn t. The order was given, the joint rolled
up, and the carver, under Mr. Wilcox s direction, cut the meat where
it was succulent, and piled their plates high. Mr. Cahill insisted on
sirloin, but admitted that he had made a mistake later on. He and
Evie soon fell into a conversation of the  No, I didn t; yes, you did 
 type--conversation which, though fascinating to those who are engaged in
it, neither desires nor deserves the attention of others.

 It s a golden rule to tip the carver. Tip everywhere s my motto. 

 Perhaps it does make life more human. 

 Then the fellows know one again. Especially in the East, if you tip,
they remember you from year s end to year s end. 

 Have you been in the East? 

 Oh, Greece and the Levant. I used to go out for sport and business to
Cyprus; some military society of a sort there. A few piastres, properly
distributed, help to keep one s memory green. But you, of course, think
this shockingly cynical. How s your discussion society getting on? Any
new Utopias lately? 

 No, I m house-hunting, Mr. Wilcox, as I ve already told you once. Do
you know of any houses? 

 Afraid I don t. 

 Well, what s the point of being practical if you can t find two
distressed females a house? We merely want a small house with large
rooms, and plenty of them. 

 Evie, I like that! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn house-agent for
her! 

 What s that, father? 

 I want a new home in September, and some one must find it. I can t. 

 Percy, do you know of anything? 

 I can t say I do,  said Mr. Cahill.

 How like you! You re never any good. 

 Never any good. Just listen to her! Never any good. Oh, come! 

 Well, you aren t. Miss Schlegel, is he? 

The torrent of their love, having splashed these drops at Margaret,
swept away on its habitual course. She sympathised with it now, for a
little comfort had restored her geniality. Speech and silence pleased
her equally, and while Mr. Wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about
cheese, her eyes surveyed the restaurant, and aired its well-calculated
tributes to the solidity of our past. Though no more Old English than
the works of Kipling, it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly
that her criticism was lulled, and the guests whom it was nourishing for
imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson Adams or Tom Jones.
Scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the ear.  Right you are! I ll cable
out to Uganda this evening,  came from the table behind.  Their Emperor
wants war; well, let him have it,  was the opinion of a clergyman. She
smiled at such incongruities.  Next time,  she said to Mr. Wilcox,  you
shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles s. 

 With pleasure. 

 No, you d hate it,  she said, pushing her glass towards him for some
more cider.  It s all proteids and body buildings, and people come up to
you and beg your pardon, but you have such a beautiful aura. 

 A what? 

 Never heard of an aura? Oh, happy, happy man! I scrub at mine for
hours. Nor of an astral plane? 

He had heard of astral planes, and censured them.

 Just so. Luckily it was Helen s aura, not mine, and she had to
chaperone it and do the politenesses. I just sat with my handkerchief in
my mouth till the man went. 

 Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls. No one s ever asked me
about my--what d ye call it? Perhaps I ve not got one. 

 You re bound to have one, but it may be such a terrible colour that no
one dares mention it. 

 Tell me, though, Miss Schlegel, do you really believe in the
supernatural and all that? 

 Too difficult a question. 

 Why s that? Gruyere or Stilton? 

 Gruyere, please. 

 Better have Stilton.

 Stilton. Because, though I don t believe in auras, and think
Theosophy s only a halfway-house-- 

 --Yet there may be something in it all the same,  he concluded, with a
frown.

 Not even that. It may be halfway in the wrong direction. I can t
explain. I don t believe in all these fads, and yet I don t like saying
that I don t believe in them. 

He seemed unsatisfied, and said:  So you wouldn t give me your word that
you DON T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it? 

 I could,  said Margaret, surprised that the point was of any importance
to him.  Indeed, I will. When I talked about scrubbing my aura, I was
only trying to be funny. But why do you want this settled? 

 I don t know. 

 Now, Mr. Wilcox, you do know. 

 Yes, I am,   No, you re not,  burst from the lovers opposite. Margaret
was silent for a moment, and then changed the subject.

 How s your house? 

 Much the same as when you honoured it last week. 

 I don t mean Ducie Street. Howards End, of course. 

 Why  of course ? 

 Can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us? We re nearly demented. 

 Let me think. I wish I could help you. But I thought you wanted to be
in town. One bit of advice: fix your district, then fix your price, and
then don t budge. That s how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton. I said
to myself,  I mean to be exactly here,  and I was, and Oniton s a place
in a thousand. 

 But I do budge. Gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses--cow them with an
eye, and up they come, trembling. Ladies can t. It s the houses that are
mesmerising me. I ve no control over the saucy things. Houses are alive.
No? 

 I m out of my depth,  he said, and added:  Didn t you talk rather like
that to your office boy? 

 Did I?--I mean I did, more or less. I talk the same way to every
one--or try to. 

 Yes, I know. And how much of it do you suppose he understood? 

 That s his lookout. I don t believe in suiting my conversation to my
company. One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems
to do well enough, but it s no more like the real thing than money
is like food. There s no nourishment in it. You pass it to the lower
classes, and they pass it back to you, and this you call  social
intercourse  or  mutual endeavour,  when it s mutual priggishness if
it s anything. Our friends at Chelsea don t see this. They say one ought
to be at all costs intelligible, and sacrifice-- 

 Lower classes,  interrupted Mr. Wilcox, as it were thrusting his hand
into her speech.  Well, you do admit that there are rich and poor.
That s something. 

Margaret could not reply. Was he incredibly stupid, or did he understand
her better than she understood herself?

 You do admit that, if wealth was divided up equally, in a few years
there would be rich and poor again just the same. The hard-working man
would come to the top, the wastrel sink to the bottom. 

 Every one admits that. 

 Your Socialists don t. 

 My Socialists do. Yours mayn t; but I strongly suspect yours of being
not Socialists, but ninepins, which you have constructed for your own
amusement. I can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite
so easily. 

He would have resented this had she not been a woman. But women may say
anything--it was one of his holiest beliefs--and he only retorted, with
a gay smile:  I don t care. You ve made two damaging admissions, and I m
heartily with you in both. 

In time they finished lunch, and Margaret, who had excused herself from
the Hippodrome, took her leave. Evie had scarcely addressed her, and she
suspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father. He
and she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more
intimate acquaintance. It had begun long ago. She had been his wife s
friend and, as such, he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a
memento. It was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette, and he had
always preferred her to Helen--unlike most men. But the advance had been
astonishing lately. They had done more in a week than in two years, and
were really beginning to know each other.

She did not forget his promise to sample Eustace Miles, and asked him as
soon as she could secure Tibby as his chaperon. He came, and partook of
body-building dishes with humility.

Next morning the Schlegels left for Swanage. They had not succeeded in
finding a new home.

17,17,3846,3975,4105,"

As they were seated at Aunt Juley s breakfast-table at The Bays,
parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay, a
letter came for Margaret and threw her into perturbation. It was from
Mr. Wilcox. It announced an  important change  in his plans. Owing to
Evie s marriage, he had decided to give up his house in Ducie Street,
and was willing to let it on a yearly tenancy. It was a businesslike
letter, and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would
not do. Also the rent. If they approved, Margaret was to come up AT
ONCE--the words were underlined, as is necessary when dealing with
women--and to go over the house with him. If they disapproved, a wire
would oblige, as he should put it into the hands of an agent.

The letter perturbed, because she was not sure what it meant. If he
liked her, if he had manoeuvred to get her to Simpson s, might this be a
manoeuvre to get her to London, and result in an offer of marriage?
She put it to herself as indelicately as possible, in the hope that her
brain would cry,  Rubbish, you re a self-conscious fool!  But her brain
only tingled a little and was silent, and for a time she sat gazing at
the mincing waves, and wondering whether the news would seem strange to
the others.

As soon as she began speaking, the sound of her own voice reassured her.
There could be nothing in it. The replies also were typical, and in the
burr of conversation her fears vanished.

 You needn t go though--  began her hostess.

 I needn t, but hadn t I better? It s really getting rather serious. We
let chance after chance slip, and the end of it is we shall be bundled
out bag and baggage into the street. We don t know what we WANT, that s
the mischief with us-- 

 No, we have no real ties,  said Helen, helping herself to toast.

 Shan t I go up to town to-day, take the house if it s the least
possible, and then come down by the afternoon train to-morrow, and start
enjoying myself. I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this
business is off my mind. 

 But you won t do anything rash, Margaret? 

 There s nothing rash to do. 

 Who ARE the Wilcoxes?  said Tibby, a question that sounds silly, but
was really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried
to answer it.  I don t MANAGE the Wilcoxes; I don t see where they come
IN. 

 No more do I,  agreed Helen.  It s funny that we just don t lose sight
of them. Out of all our hotel acquaintances, Mr. Wilcox is the only one
who has stuck. It is now over three years, and we have drifted away from
far more interesting people in that time. 

 Interesting people don t get one houses. 

 Meg, if you start in your honest-English vein, I shall throw the
treacle at you. 

 It s a better vein than the cosmopolitan,  said Margaret, getting up.
 Now, children, which is it to be? You know the Ducie Street house.
Shall I say yes or shall I say no? Tibby love--which? I m specially
anxious to pin you both. 

 It all depends on what meaning you attach to the word  possible  

 It depends on nothing of the sort. Say  yes.  

 Say  no.  

Then Margaret spoke rather seriously.  I think,  she said,  that our
race is degenerating. We cannot settle even this little thing; what will
it be like when we have to settle a big one? 

 It will be as easy as eating,  returned Helen.

 I was thinking of father. How could he settle to leave Germany as he
did, when he had fought for it as a young man, and all his feelings
and friends were Prussian? How could he break loose with Patriotism and
begin aiming at something else? It would have killed me. When he was
nearly forty he could change countries and ideals--and we, at our age,
can t change houses. It s humiliating. 

 Your father may have been able to change countries,  said Mrs. Munt
with asperity,  and that may or may not be a good thing. But he could
change houses no better than you can, in fact, much worse. Never shall I
forget what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester. 

 I knew it,  cried Helen.  I told you so. It is the little things one
bungles at. The big, real ones are nothing when they come. 

 Bungle, my dear! You are too little to recollect--in fact, you weren t
there. But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move
before the lease for Wickham Place was signed, and Emily took train with
baby--who was Margaret then--and the smaller luggage for London, without
so much as knowing where her new home would be. Getting away from that
house may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we all went
through getting you into it. 

Helen, with her mouth full, cried:

 And that s the man who beat the Austrians, and the Danes, and the
French, and who beat the Germans that were inside himself. And we re
like him. 

 Speak for yourself,  said Tibby.  Remember that I am cosmopolitan,
please. 

 Helen may be right. 

 Of course she s right,  said Helen.

Helen might be right, but she did not go up to London. Margaret did
that. An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries, and one
may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one
away from the sea and friends. She could not believe that her father had
ever felt the same. Her eyes had been troubling her lately, so that she
could not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape,
which she had seen but yesterday. At Southampton she  waved  to Frieda;
Frieda was on her way down to join them at Swanage, and Mrs. Munt had
calculated that their trains would cross. But Frieda was looking the
other way, and Margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and
old-maidish. How like an old maid to fancy that Mr. Wilcox was
courting her! She had once visited a spinster--poor, silly, and
unattractive--whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell
in love. How Margaret s heart had bled for the deluded thing! How she
had lectured, reasoned, and in despair acquiesced!  I may have been
deceived by the curate, my dear, but the young fellow who brings the
midday post really is fond of me, and has, as a matter of fact--  It had
always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age, yet she might
be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity.

Mr. Wilcox met her at Waterloo himself. She felt certain that he was
not the same as usual; for one thing, he took offence at everything she
said.

 This is awfully kind of you,  she began,  but I m afraid it s not going
to do. The house has not been built that suits the Schlegel family. 

 What! Have you come up determined not to deal? 

 Not exactly. 

 Not exactly? In that case let s be starting. 

She lingered to admire the motor, which was new, and a fairer creature
than the vermilion giant that had borne Aunt Juley to her doom three
years before.

 Presumably it s very beautiful,  she said.  How do you like it, Crane? 

 Come, let s be starting,  repeated her host.  How on earth did you know
that my chauffeur was called Crane? 

 Why, I know Crane; I ve been for a drive with Evie once. I know that
you ve got a parlourmaid called Milton. I know all sorts of things. 

 Evie!  he echoed in injured tones.  You won t see her. She s gone out
with Cahill. It s no fun, I can tell you, being left so much alone. I ve
got my work all day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when I
come home in the evening, I tell you, I can t stand the house. 

 In my absurd way, I m lonely too,  Margaret replied.  It s
heart-breaking to leave one s old home. I scarcely remember anything
before Wickham Place, and Helen and Tibby were born there. Helen says-- 

 You, too, feel lonely? 

 Horribly. Hullo, Parliament s back! 

Mr. Wilcox glanced at Parliament contemptuously. The more important
ropes of life lay elsewhere.  Yes, they are talking again,  said he.
 But you were going to say-- 

 Only some rubbish about furniture. Helen says it alone endures while
men and houses perish, and that in the end the world will be a desert of
chairs and sofas--just imagine it!--rolling through infinity with no one
to sit upon them. 

 Your sister always likes her little joke. 

 She says  Yes,  my brother says `No,  to Ducie Street. It s no fun
helping us, Mr. Wilcox, I assure you. 

 You are not as unpractical as you pretend. I shall never believe it. 

Margaret laughed. But she was--quite as unpractical. She could not
concentrate on details. Parliament, the Thames, the irresponsive
chauffeur, would flash into the field of house-hunting, and all demand
some comment or response. It is impossible to see modern life steadily
and see it whole, and she had chosen to see it whole. Mr. Wilcox saw
steadily. He never bothered over the mysterious or the private. The
Thames might run inland from the sea, the chauffeur might conceal all
passion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin. They knew their own
business, and he knew his.

Yet she liked being with him. He was not a rebuke, but a stimulus, and
banished morbidity. Some twenty years her senior, he preserved a gift
that she supposed herself to have already lost--not youth s creative
power, but its self-confidence and optimism. He was so sure that it was
a very pleasant world. His complexion was robust, his hair had receded
but not thinned, the thick moustache and the eyes that Helen had
compared to brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them, whether they
were turned towards the slums or towards the stars. Some day--in the
millennium--there may be no need for his type. At present, homage is due
to it from those who think themselves superior, and who possibly are.

 At all events you responded to my telegram promptly,  he remarked.

 Oh, even I know a good thing when I see it. 

 I m glad you don t despise the goods of this world. 

 Heavens, no! Only idiots and prigs do that. 

 I am glad, very glad,  he repeated, suddenly softening and turning to
her, as if the remark had pleased him.  There is so much cant talked in
would-be intellectual circles. I am glad you don t share it. Self-denial
is all very well as a means of strengthening the character. But I can t
stand those people who run down comforts. They have usually some axe to
grind. Can you? 

 Comforts are of two kinds,  said Margaret, who was keeping herself in
hand-- those we can share with others, like fire, weather, or music; and
those we can t--food, food, for instance. It depends. 

 I mean reasonable comforts, of course. I shouldn t like to think that
you--  He bent nearer; the sentence died unfinished. Margaret s head
turned very stupid, and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the
beacon in a lighthouse. He did not kiss her, for the hour was half-past
twelve, and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham Palace. But
the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to
exist on her account, and she was surprised that Crane did not realise
this, and turn round. Idiot though she might be, surely Mr. Wilcox was
more--how should one put it?--more psychological than usual. Always a
good judge of character for business purposes, he seemed this afternoon
to enlarge his field, and to note qualities outside neatness, obedience,
and decision.

 I want to go over the whole house,  she announced when they arrived.
 As soon as I get back to Swanage, which will be to-morrow afternoon,
I ll talk it over once more with Helen and Tibby, and wire you  yes  or
 no.  

 Right. The dining-room.  And they began their survey.

The dining-room was big, but over-furnished. Chelsea would have moaned
aloud. Mr. Wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince,
and relent, and refrain, and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and
pluck. After so much self-colour and self-denial, Margaret viewed with
relief the sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded wall-paper, amid whose
foliage parrots sang. It would never do with her own furniture, but
those heavy chairs, that immense sideboard loaded with presentation
plate, stood up against its pressure like men. The room suggested men,
and Margaret, keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and
hunters of the past, saw it as an ancient guest-hall, where the lord sat
at meat among his thanes. Even the Bible--the Dutch Bible that Charles
had brought back from the Boer War--fell into position. Such a room
admitted loot.

 Now the entrance-hall. 

The entrance-hall was paved.

 Here we fellows smoke. 

We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather. It was as if a motor-car
had spawned.  Oh, jolly!  said Margaret, sinking into one of them.

 You do like it?  he said, fixing his eyes on her upturned face, and
surely betraying an almost intimate note.  It s all rubbish not making
oneself comfortable. Isn t it? 

 Ye--es. Semi-rubbish. Are those Cruikshanks? 

 Gillrays. Shall we go on upstairs? 

 Does all this furniture come from Howards End? 

 The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton. 

 Does--However, I m concerned with the house, not the furniture. How big
is this smoking-room? 

 Thirty by fifteen. No, wait a minute. Fifteen and a half. 

 Ah, well. Mr. Wilcox, aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with
which we middle classes approach the subject of houses? 

They proceeded to the drawing-room. Chelsea managed better here. It was
sallow and ineffective. One could visualise the ladies withdrawing
to it, while their lords discussed life s realities below, to the
accompaniment of cigars. Had Mrs. Wilcox s drawing-room at Howards End
looked thus? Just as this thought entered Margaret s brain, Mr. Wilcox
did ask her to be his wife, and the knowledge that she had been right so
overcame her that she nearly fainted.

But the proposal was not to rank among the world s great love scenes.

 Miss Schlegel --his voice was firm-- I have had you up on false
pretences. I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a
house. 

Margaret almost answered:  I know-- 

 Could you be induced to share my--is it probable-- 

 Oh, Mr. Wilcox!  she interrupted, taking hold of the piano and averting
her eyes.  I see, I see. I will write to you afterwards if I may. 

He began to stammer.  Miss Schlegel--Margaret you don t understand. 

 Oh yes! Indeed, yes!  said Margaret.

 I am asking you to be my wife. 

So deep already was her sympathy, that when he said,  I am asking you
to be my wife,  she made herself give a little start. She must show
surprise if he expected it. An immense joy came over her. It was
indescribable. It had nothing to do with humanity, and most resembled
the all-pervading happiness of fine weather. Fine weather is due to the
sun, but Margaret could think of no central radiance here. She stood in
his drawing-room happy, and longing to give happiness. On leaving him
she realised that the central radiance had been love.

 You aren t offended, Miss Schlegel? 

 How could I be offended? 

There was a moment s pause. He was anxious to get rid of her, and she
knew it. She had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for
possessions that money cannot buy. He desired comradeship and affection,
but he feared them, and she, who had taught herself only to desire, and
could have clothed the struggle with beauty, held back, and hesitated
with him.

 Good-bye,  she continued.  You will have a letter from me--I am going
back to Swanage to-morrow. 

 Thank you. 

 Good-bye, and it s you I thank. 

 I may order the motor round, mayn t I? 

 That would be most kind. 

 I wish I had written. Ought I to have written? 

 Not at all. 

 There s just one question-- 

She shook her head. He looked a little bewildered as they parted.

They parted without shaking hands; she had kept the interview, for his
sake, in tints of the quietest grey. She thrilled with happiness ere
she reached her house. Others had loved her in the past, if one apply
to their brief desires so grave a word, but the others had been
 ninnies --young men who had nothing to do, old men who could find
nobody better. And she had often  loved,  too, but only so far as
the facts of sex demanded: mere yearnings for the masculine sex to be
dismissed for what they were worth, with a sigh. Never before had her
personality been touched. She was not young or very rich, and it amazed
her that a man of any standing should take her seriously.  As she sat,
trying to do accounts in her empty house, amidst beautiful pictures and
noble books, waves of emotion broke, as if a tide of passion was flowing
through the night air. She shook her head, tried to concentrate her
attention, and failed. In vain did she repeat:  But I ve been through
this sort of thing before.  She had never been through it; the big
machinery, as opposed to the little, had been set in motion, and the
idea that Mr. Wilcox loved, obsessed her before she came to love him in
return.

She would come to no decision yet.  Oh, sir, this is so sudden --that
prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came. Premonitions
are not preparation. She must examine more closely her own nature and
his; she must talk it over judicially with Helen. It had been a strange
love-scene--the central radiance unacknowledged from first to last. She,
in his place, would have said Ich liebe dich, but perhaps it was not
his habit to open the heart. He might have done it if she had pressed
him--as a matter of duty, perhaps; England expects every man to open
his heart once; but the effort would have jarred him, and never, if
she could avoid it, should he lose those defences that he had chosen to
raise against the world. He must never be bothered with emotional talk,
or with a display of sympathy. He was an elderly man now, and it would
be futile and impudent to correct him.

Mrs. Wilcox strayed in and out, ever a welcome ghost; surveying the
scene, thought Margaret, without one hint of bitterness.

cosmopolitan   said margaret  getting up   now  children  which is it to be  you know the ducie street house  shall i say yes or shall i say no  tibby love  which  i m specially anxious to pin you both     it all depends on what meaning you attach to the word  possible     it depends on nothing of the sort  say  yes      say  no     then margaret spoke rather seriously   i think   she said   that our race is degenerating  we cannot settle even this little thing  what will it be like when we have to settle a big one     it will be as easy as eating   returned helen    i was thinking of father  how could he settle to leave germany as he did  when he had fought for it as a young man  and all his feelings and friends were prussian  how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else  it would have killed me  when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals  and we  at our age  can t change houses  it s humiliating     your father may have been able to change countries   said mrs  munt with asperity   and that may or may not be a good thing  but he could change houses no better than you can  in fact  much worse  never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester     i knew it   cried helen   i told you so  it is the little things one bungles at  the big  real ones are nothing when they come     bungle  my dear  you are too little to recollect  in fact  you weren t there  but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed  and emily took train with baby  who was margaret then  and the smaller luggage for london  without so much as knowing where her new home would be  getting away from that house may be hard  but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it    helen  with her mouth full  cried    and that s the man who beat the austrians  and the danes  and the french  and who beat the germans that were inside himself  and we re like him     speak for yourself   said tibby   remember that i am cosmopolitan  please     helen may be right     of course she s right   said helen   helen might be right  but she did not go up to london  margaret did that  an interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries  and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends  she could not believe that her father had ever felt the same  her eyes had been troubling her lately  so that she could not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape  which she had seen but yesterday  at southampton she  waved  to frieda  frieda was on her way down to join them at swanage  and mrs  munt had calculated that their trains would cross  but frieda was looking the other way  and margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and old maidish  how like an old maid to fancy that mr  wilcox was courting her  she had once visited a spinster  poor  silly  and unattractive  whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love  how margaret s heart had bled for the deluded thing  how she had lectured  reasoned  and in despair acquiesced   i may have been deceived by the curate  my dear  but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me  and has  as a matter of fact    it had always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age  yet she might be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity   mr  wilcox met her at waterloo himself  she felt certain that he was not the same as usual  for one thing  he took offence at everything she said    this is awfully kind of you   she began   but i m afraid it s not going to do  the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family     what  have you come up determined not to deal     not exactly     not exactly  in that case let s be starting    she lingered to admire the motor  which was new  and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne aunt juley to her doom three years before    presumably it s very beautiful   she said   how do you like it  crane     come  let s be starting   repeated her host   how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane     why  i know crane  i ve been for a drive with evie once  i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton  i know all sorts of things     evie   he echoed in injured tones   you won t see her  she s gone out with cahill  it s no fun  i can tell you  being left so much alone  i ve got my work all day  indeed  a great deal too much of it  but when i come home in the evening  i tell you  i can t stand the house     in my absurd way  i m lonely too   margaret replied   it s heart breaking to leave one s old home  i scarcely remember anything before wickham place  and helen and tibby were born there  helen says      you  too  feel lonely     horribly  hullo  parliament s back    mr  wilcox glanced at parliament contemptuously  the more important ropes of life lay elsewhere   yes  they are talking again   said he   but you were going to say      only some rubbish about furniture  helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish  and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas  just imagine it   rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them     your sister always likes her little joke     she says  yes   my brother says  no   to ducie street  it s no fun helping us  mr  wilcox  i assure you     you are not as unpractical as you pretend  i shall never believe it    margaret laughed  but she was  quite as unpractical  she could not concentrate on details  parliament  the thames  the irresponsive chauffeur  would flash into the field of house hunting  and all demand some comment or response  it is impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole  and she had chosen to see it whole  mr  wilcox saw steadily  he never bothered over the mysterious or the private  the thames might run inland from the sea  the chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin  they knew their own business  and he knew his   yet she liked being with him  he was not a rebuke  but a stimulus  and banished morbidity  some twenty years her senior  he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lost  not youth s creative power  but its self confidence and optimism  he was so sure that it was a very pleasant world  his complexion was robust  his hair had receded but not thinned  the thick moustache and the eyes that helen had compared to brandy balls had an agreeable menace in them  whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the stars  some day  in the millennium  there may be no need for his type  at present  homage is due to it from those who think themselves superior  and who possibly are    at all events you responded to my telegram promptly   he remarked    oh  even i know a good thing when i see it     i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world     heavens  no  only idiots and prigs do that     i am glad  very glad   he repeated  suddenly softening and turning to her  as if the remark had pleased him   there is so much cannot talked in would be intellectual circles  i am glad you don t share it  self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character  but i can t stand those people who run down comforts  they have usually some axe to grind  can you     comforts are of two kinds   said margaret  who was keeping herself in hand   those we can share with others  like fire  weather  or music  and those we can t  food  food  for instance  it depends     i mean reasonable comforts  of course  i shouldn t like to think that you    he bent nearer  the sentence died unfinished  margaret s head turned very stupid  and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse  he did not kiss her  for the hour was half past twelve  and the car was passing by the stables of buckingham palace  but the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on her account  and she was surprised that crane did not realise this  and turn round  idiot though she might be  surely mr  wilcox was more  how should one put it   more psychological than usual  always a good judge of character for business purposes  he seemed this afternoon to enlarge his field  and to note qualities outside neatness  obedience  and decision    i want to go over the whole house   she announced when they arrived   as soon as i get back to swanage  which will be to morrow afternoon  i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby  and wire you  yes  or  no      right  the dining room   and they began their survey   the dining room was big  but over furnished  chelsea would have moaned aloud  mr  wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince  and relent  and refrain  and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck  after so much self colour and self denial  margaret viewed with relief the sumptuous dado  the frieze  the gilded wall paper  amid whose foliage parrots sang  it would never do with her own furniture  but those heavy chairs  that immense sideboard loaded with presentation plate  stood up against its pressure like men  the room suggested men  and margaret  keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past  saw it as an ancient guest hall  where the lord sat at meat among his thanes  even the bible  the dutch bible that charles had brought back from the boer war  fell into position  such a room admitted loot    now the entrance hall    the entrance hall was paved    here we fellows smoke    we fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather  it was as if a motor car had spawned   oh  jolly   said margaret  sinking into one of them    you do like it   he said  fixing his eyes on her upturned face  and surely betraying an almost intimate note   it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable  isn t it     ye  es  semi rubbish  are those cruikshanks     gillrays  shall we go on upstairs     does all this furniture come from howards end     the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton     does  however  i m concerned with the house  not the furniture  how big is this smoking room     thirty by fifteen  no  wait a minute  fifteen and a half     ah  well  mr  wilcox  aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses    they proceeded to the drawing room  chelsea managed better here  it was sallow and ineffective  one could visualise the ladies withdrawing to it  while their lords discussed life s realities below  to the accompaniment of cigars  had mrs  wilcox s drawing room at howards end looked thus  just as this thought entered margaret s brain  mr  wilcox did ask her to be his wife  and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly fainted   but the proposal was not to rank among the world s great love scenes    miss schlegel   his voice was firm   i have had you up on false pretences  i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house    margaret almost answered   i know      could you be induced to share my  is it probable      oh  mr  wilcox   she interrupted  taking hold of the piano and averting her eyes   i see  i see  i will write to you afterwards if i may    he began to stammer   miss schlegel  margaret you don t understand     oh yes  indeed  yes   said margaret    i am asking you to be my wife    so deep already was her sympathy  that when he said   i am asking you to be my wife   she made herself give a little start  she must show surprise if he expected it  an immense joy came over her  it was indescribable  it had nothing to do with humanity  and most resembled the all pervading happiness of fine weather  fine weather is due to the sun  but margaret could think of no central radiance here  she stood in his drawing room happy  and longing to give happiness  on leaving him she realised that the central radiance had been love    you aren t offended  miss schlegel     how could i be offended    there was a moment s pause  he was anxious to get rid of her  and she knew it  she had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money cannot buy  he desired comradeship and affection  but he feared them  and she  who had taught herself only to desire  and could have clothed the struggle with beauty  held back  and hesitated with him    good bye   she continued   you will have a letter from me  i am going back to swanage to morrow     thank you     good bye  and it s you i thank     i may order the motor round  mayn t i     that would be most kind     i wish i had written  ought i to have written     not at all     there s just one question     she shook her head  he looked a little bewildered as they parted   they parted without shaking hands  she had kept the interview  for his sake  in tints of the quietest grey  she thrilled with happiness ere she reached her house  others had loved her in the past  if one apply to their brief desires so grave a word  but the others had been  ninnies   young men who had nothing to do  old men who could find nobody better  and she had often  loved   too  but only so far as the facts of sex demanded  mere yearnings for the masculine sex to be dismissed for what they were worth  with a sigh  never before had her personality been touched  she was not young or very rich  and it amazed her that a man of any standing should take her seriously   as she sat  trying to do accounts in her empty house  amidst beautiful pictures and noble books  waves of emotion broke  as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night air  she shook her head  tried to concentrate her attention  and failed  in vain did she repeat   but i ve been through this sort of thing before   she had never been through it  the big machinery  as opposed to the little  had been set in motion  and the idea that mr  wilcox loved  obsessed her before she came to love him in return   she would come to no decision yet   oh  sir  this is so sudden   that prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came  premonitions are not preparation  she must examine more closely her own nature and his  she must talk it over judicially with helen  it had been a strange love scene  the central radiance unacknowledged from first to last  she  in his place  would have said ich liebe dich  but perhaps it was not his habit to open the heart  he might have done it if she had pressed him  as a matter of duty  perhaps  england expects every man to open his heart once  but the effort would have jarred him  and never  if she could avoid it  should he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against the world  he must never be bothered with emotional talk  or with a display of sympathy  he was an elderly man now  and it would be futile and impudent to correct him   mrs  wilcox strayed in and out  ever a welcome ghost  surveying the scene  thought margaret  without one hint of

If one wanted to show a foreigner England, perhaps the wisest course
would be to take him to the final section of the Purbeck Hills, and
stand him on their summit, a few miles to the east of Corfe. Then system
after system of our island would roll together under his feet. Beneath
him is the valley of the Frome, and all the wild lands that come tossing
down from Dorchester, black and gold, to mirror their gorse in the
expanses of Poole. The valley of the Stour is beyond, unaccountable
stream, dirty at Blandford, pure at Wimborne--the Stour, sliding out of
fat fields, to marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christ church. The
valley of the Avon--invisible, but far to the north the trained eye may
see Clearbury Ring that guards it, and the imagination may leap beyond
that on to Salisbury Plain itself, and beyond the Plain to all the
glorious downs of Central England. Nor is Suburbia absent. Bournemouth s
ignoble coast cowers to the right, heralding the pine-trees that mean,
for all their beauty, red houses, and the Stock Exchange, and extend to
the gates of London itself. So tremendous is the City s trail! But the
cliffs of Freshwater it shall never touch, and the island will guard the
Island s purity till the end of time. Seen from the west the Wight is
beautiful beyond all laws of beauty. It is as if a fragment of England
floated forward to greet the foreigner--chalk of our chalk, turf of
our turf, epitome of what will follow. And behind the fragment lies
Southampton, hostess to the nations, and Portsmouth, a latent fire, and
all around it, with double and treble collision of tides, swirls the
sea. How many villages appear in this view! How many castles! How many
churches, vanished or triumphant! How many ships, railways, and roads!
What incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what
final end! The reason fails, like a wave on the Swanage beach; the
imagination swells, spreads, and deepens, until it becomes geographic
and encircles England.

So Frieda Mosebach, now Frau Architect Liesecke, and mother to her
husband s baby, was brought up to these heights to be impressed, and,
after a prolonged gaze, she said that the hills were more swelling
here than in Pomerania, which was true, but did not seem to Mrs. Munt
apposite. Poole Harbour was dry, which led her to praise the absence of
muddy foreshore at Friedrich Wilhelms Bad, Rugen, where beech-trees hang
over the tideless Baltic, and cows may contemplate the brine. Rather
unhealthy Mrs. Munt thought this would be, water being safer when it
moved about.

 And your English lakes--Vindermere, Grasmere they, then, unhealthy? 

 No, Frau Liesecke; but that is because they are fresh water, and
different. Salt water ought to have tides, and go up and down a great
deal, or else it smells. Look, for instance, at an aquarium. 

 An aquarium! Oh, MEESIS Munt, you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums
stink less than salt? Why, then Victor, my brother-in-law, collected
many tadpoles--   You are not to say  stink,   interrupted Helen;  at
least, you may say it, but you must pretend you are being funny while
you say it. 

 Then  smell.  And the mud of your Pool down there--does it not smell,
or may I say  stink,  ha, ha? 

 There always has been mud in Poole Harbour,  said Mrs. Munt, with
a slight frown.  The rivers bring it down, and a most valuable
oyster-fishery depends upon it. 

 Yes, that is so,  conceded Frieda; and another international incident
was closed.

  Bournemouth is,   resumed their hostess, quoting a local rhyme to
which she was much attached--  Bournemouth is, Poole was, and Swanage
is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three.  Now,
Frau Liesecke, I have shown you Bournemouth, and I have shown you Poole,
so let us walk backward a little, and look down again at Swanage. 

 Aunt Juley, wouldn t that be Meg s train? 

A tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour, and now was bearing
southwards towards them over the black and the gold.

 Oh, dearest Margaret, I do hope she won t be overtired. 

 Oh, I do wonder--I do wonder whether she s taken the house. 

 I hope she hasn t been hasty. 

 So do I--oh, SO do I. 

 Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place?  Frieda asked.

 I should think it would. Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud. All
those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way, and I can t
think why he doesn t keep on with it. But it s really for Evie that he
went there, and now that Evie s going to be married-- 

 Ah! 

 You ve never seen Miss Wilcox, Frieda. How absurdly matrimonial you
are! 

 But sister to that Paul? 

 Yes. 

 And to that Charles,  said Mrs. Munt with feeling.  Oh, Helen, Helen,
what a time that was! 

Helen laughed.  Meg and I haven t got such tender hearts. If there s a
chance of a cheap house, we go for it. 

 Now look, Frau Liesecke, at my niece s train. You see, it is coming
towards us--coming, coming; and, when it gets to Corfe, it will actually
go THROUGH the downs, on which we are standing, so that, if we walk
over, as I suggested, and look down on Swanage, we shall see it coming
on the other side. Shall we? 

Frieda assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and
exchanged the greater view for the lesser. Rather a dull valley lay
below, backed by the slope of the coastward downs. They were looking
across the Isle of Purbeck and on to Swanage, soon to be the most
important town of all, and ugliest of the three. Margaret s train
reappeared as promised, and was greeted with approval by her aunt.
It came to a standstill in the middle distance, and there it had been
planned that Tibby should meet her, and drive her, and a tea-basket, up
to join them.

 You see,  continued Helen to her cousin,  the Wilcoxes collect houses
as your Victor collects tadpoles. They have, one, Ducie Street; two,
Howards End, where my great rumpus was; three, a country seat in
Shropshire; four, Charles has a house in Hilton; and five, another near
Epsom; and six, Evie will have a house when she marries, and probably a
pied-a-terre in the country--which makes seven. Oh yes, and Paul a
hut in Africa makes eight. I wish we could get Howards End. That was
something like a dear little house! Didn t you think so, Aunt Juley? 

 I had too much to do, dear, to look at it,  said Mrs. Munt, with a
gracious dignity.  I had everything to settle and explain, and Charles
Wilcox to keep in his place besides. It isn t likely I should remember
much. I just remember having lunch in your bedroom. 

 Yes, so do I. But, oh dear, dear, how dreadful it all seems! And in the
autumn there began that anti-Pauline movement--you, and Frieda, and
Meg, and Mrs. Wilcox, all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry
Paul. 

 You yet may,  said Frieda despondently.

Helen shook her head.  The Great Wilcox Peril will never return. If I m
certain of anything it s of that. 

 One is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions. 

The remark fell damply on the conversation. But Helen slipped her arm
round her cousin, somehow liking her the better for making it. It was
not an original remark, nor had Frieda appropriated it passionately, for
she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind. Yet it betrayed that
interest in the universal which the average Teuton possesses and the
average Englishman does not. It was, however illogically, the good,
the beautiful, the true, as opposed to the respectable, the pretty,
the adequate. It was a landscape of Bocklin s beside a landscape of
Leader s, strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural
life. It sharpened idealism, stirred the soul. It may have been a bad
preparation for what followed.

 Look!  cried Aunt Juley, hurrying away from generalities over the
narrow summit of the down.  Stand where I stand, and you will see the
pony-cart coming. I see the pony-cart coming. 

They stood and saw the pony-cart coming. Margaret and Tibby were
presently seen coming in it. Leaving the outskirts of Swanage, it drove
for a little through the budding lanes, and then began the ascent.

 Have you got the house?  they shouted, long before she could possibly
hear.

Helen ran down to meet her. The highroad passed over a saddle, and a
track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down.

 Have you got the house? 

Margaret shook her head.

 Oh, what a nuisance! So we re as we were? 

 Not exactly. 

She got out, looking tired.

 Some mystery,  said Tibby.  We are to be enlightened presently. 

Margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal
of marriage from Mr. Wilcox.

Helen was amused. She opened the gate on to the downs so that her
brother might lead the pony through.  It s just like a widower,  she
remarked.  They ve cheek enough for anything, and invariably select one
of their first wife s friends. 

Margaret s face flashed despair.

 That type--  She broke off with a cry.  Meg, not anything wrong with
you? 

 Wait one minute,  said Margaret, whispering always.

 But you ve never conceivably--you ve never--  She pulled herself
together.  Tibby, hurry up through; I can t hold this gate indefinitely.
Aunt Juley! I say, Aunt Juley, make the tea, will you, and Frieda; we ve
got to talk houses, and will come on afterwards.  And then, turning her
face to her sister s, she burst into tears.

Margaret was stupefied. She heard herself saying,  Oh, really--  She
felt herself touched with a hand that trembled.

 Don t,  sobbed Helen,  don t, don t, Meg, don t!  She seemed incapable
of saying any other word. Margaret, trembling herself, led her forward
up the road, till they strayed through another gate on to the down.

 Don t, don t do such a thing! I tell you not to--don t! I know--don t! 

 What do you know? 

 Panic and emptiness,  sobbed Helen.  Don t! 

Then Margaret thought,  Helen is a little selfish. I have never behaved
like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying.  She said:
 But we would still see each other very--often, and you-- 

 It s not a thing like that,  sobbed Helen. And she broke right away and
wandered distractedly upwards, stretching her hands towards the view and
crying.

 What s happened to you?  called Margaret, following through the wind
that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills.  But it s
stupid!  And suddenly stupidity seized her, and the immense landscape
was blurred. But Helen turned back.

 I don t know what s happened to either of us,  said Margaret, wiping
her eyes.  We must both have gone mad.  Then Helen wiped hers, and they
even laughed a little.

 Look here, sit down. 

 All right; I ll sit down if you ll sit down. 

 There. (One kiss.) Now, whatever, whatever is the matter? 

 I do mean what I said. Don t; it wouldn t do. 

 Oh, Helen, stop saying  don t ! It s ignorant. It s as if your head
wasn t out of the slime.  Don t  is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the
day to Mr. Bast. 

Helen was silent.

 Well? 

 Tell me about it first, and meanwhile perhaps I ll have got my head out
of the slime. 

 That s better. Well, where shall I begin? When I arrived at
Waterloo--no, I ll go back before that, because I m anxious you should
know everything from the first. The  first  was about ten days ago. It
was the day Mr. Bast came to tea and lost his temper. I was defending
him, and Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me, however slightly. I thought
it was the involuntary thing, which men can t help any more than we can.
You know--at least, I know in my own case--when a man has said to me,
 So-and-so s a pretty girl,  I am seized with a momentary sourness
against So-and-so, and long to tweak her ear. It s a tiresome feeling,
but not an important one, and one easily manages it. But it wasn t only
this in Mr. Wilcox s case, I gather now. 

 Then you love him? 

Margaret considered.  It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for
you,  she said.  The mere fact of that grows more tremendous. Remember,
I ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years. 

 But loved him? 

Margaret peered into her past. It is pleasant to analyse feelings while
they are still only feelings, and unembodied in the social fabric. With
her arm round Helen, and her eyes shifting over the view, as if this
country or that could reveal the secret of her own heart, she meditated
honestly, and said,  No. 

 But you will? 

 Yes,  said Margaret,  of that I m pretty sure. Indeed, I began the
moment he spoke to me. 

 And have settled to marry him? 

 I had, but am wanting a long talk about it now. What is it against him,
Helen? You must try and say. 

Helen, in her turn, looked outwards.  It is ever since Paul,  she said
finally.

 But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul? 

 But he was there, they were all there that morning when I came down
to breakfast, and saw that Paul was frightened--the man who loved me
frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen, so that I knew it was
impossible, because personal relations are the important thing for ever
and ever, and not this outer life of telegrams and anger. 

She poured the sentence forth in one breath, but her sister understood
it, because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them.

 That s foolish. In the first place, I disagree about the outer life.
Well, we ve often argued that. The real point is that there is the
widest gulf between my love-making and yours. Yours was romance; mine
will be prose. I m not running it down--a very good kind of prose, but
well considered, well thought out. For instance, I know all Mr. Wilcox s
faults. He s afraid of emotion. He cares too much about success, too
little about the past. His sympathy lacks poetry, and so isn t sympathy
really. I d even say --she looked at the shining lagoons-- that,
spiritually, he s not as honest as I am. Doesn t that satisfy you? 

 No, it doesn t,  said Helen.  It makes me feel worse and worse. You
must be mad. 

Margaret made a movement of irritation.

 I don t intend him, or any man or any woman, to be all my life--good
heavens, no! There are heaps of things in me that he doesn t, and shall
never, understand. 

Thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union,
before the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between
married couples and the world. She was to keep her independence more
than do most women as yet. Marriage was to alter her fortunes rather
than her character, and she was not far wrong in boasting that she
understood her future husband. Yet he did alter her character--a little.
There was an unforeseen surprise, a cessation of the winds and odours of
life, a social pressure that would have her think conjugally.

 So with him,  she continued.  There are heaps of things in him--more
especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me. He
has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all
this--  She waved her hand at the landscape, which confirmed anything.
 If Wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in England for thousands of years,
you and I couldn t sit here without having our throats cut. There would
be no trains, no ships to carry us literary people about in, no fields
even. Just savagery. No--perhaps not even that. Without their spirit
life might never have moved out of protoplasm. More and more do I refuse
to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it. There are times
when it seems to me-- 

 And to me, and to all women. So one kissed Paul. 

 That s brutal,  said Margaret.  Mine is an absolutely different case.
I ve thought things out. 

 It makes no difference thinking things out. They come to the same. 

 Rubbish! 

There was a long silence, during which the tide returned into Poole
Harbour.  One would lose something,  murmured Helen, apparently to
herself. The water crept over the mud-flats towards the gorse and the
blackened heather. Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores, and
became a sombre episode of trees. Frome was forced inward towards
Dorchester, Stour against Wimborne, Avon towards Salisbury, and over the
immense displacement the sun presided, leading it to triumph ere he sank
to rest. England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying
for joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with
contrary motion, blew stronger against her rising seas. What did it
mean? For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her
sinuous coast? Does she belong to those who have moulded her and made
her feared by other lands, or to those who have added nothing to her
power, but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying
as a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the
brave world s fleet accompanying her towards eternity?

",if one wanted to show a foreigner england  perhaps the wisest course would be to take him to the final section of the purbeck hills  and stand him on their summit  a few miles to the east of corfe  then system after system of our island would roll together under his feet  beneath him is the valley of the frome  and all the wild lands that come tossing down from dorchester  black and gold  to mirror their gorse in the expanses of poole  the valley of the stour is beyond  unaccountable stream  dirty at blandford  pure at wimborne  the stour  sliding out of fat fields  to marry the avon beneath the tower of christ church  the valley of the avon  invisible  but far to the north the trained eye may see clearbury ring that guards it  and the imagination may leap beyond that on to salisbury plain itself  and beyond the plain to all the glorious downs of central england  nor is suburbia absent  bournemouth s ignoble coast cowers to the right  heralding the pine trees that mean  for all their beauty  red houses  and the stock exchange  and extend to the gates of london itself  so tremendous is the city s trail  but the cliffs of freshwater it shall never touch  and the island will guard the island s purity till the end of time  seen from the west the wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty  it is as if a fragment of england floated forward to greet the foreigner  chalk of our chalk  turf of our turf  epitome of what will follow  and behind the fragment lies southampton  hostess to the nations  and portsmouth  a latent fire  and all around it  with double and treble collision of tides  swirls the sea  how many villages appear in this view  how many castles  how many churches  vanished or triumphant  how many ships  railways  and roads  what incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final end  the reason fails  like a wave on the swanage beach  the imagination swells  spreads  and deepens  until it becomes geographic and encircles england   so frieda mosebach  now frau architect liesecke  and mother to her husband s baby  was brought up to these heights to be impressed  and  after a prolonged gaze  she said that the hills were more swelling here than in pomerania  which was true  but did not seem to mrs  munt apposite  poole harbour was dry  which led her to praise the absence of muddy foreshore at friedrich wilhelms bad  rugen  where beech trees hang over the tideless baltic  and cows may contemplate the brine  rather unhealthy mrs  munt thought this would be  water being safer when it moved about    and your english lakes  vindermere  grasmere they  then  unhealthy     no  frau liesecke  but that is because they are fresh water  and different  salt water ought to have tides  and go up and down a great deal  or else it smells  look  for instance  at an aquarium     an aquarium  oh  meesis munt  you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt  why  then victor  my brother in law  collected many tadpoles     you are not to say  stink    interrupted helen   at least  you may say it  but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it     then  smell   and the mud of your pool down there  does it not smell  or may i say  stink   ha  ha     there always has been mud in poole harbour   said mrs  munt  with a slight frown   the rivers bring it down  and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it     yes  that is so   conceded frieda  and another international incident was closed     bournemouth is    resumed their hostess  quoting a local rhyme to which she was much attached    bournemouth is  poole was  and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three   now  frau liesecke  i have shown you bournemouth  and i have shown you poole  so let us walk backward a little  and look down again at swanage     aunt juley  wouldn t that be meg s train    a tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour  and now was bearing southwards towards them over the black and the gold    oh  dearest margaret  i do hope she won t be overtired     oh  i do wonder  i do wonder whether she s taken the house     i hope she hasn t been hasty     so do i  oh  so do i     will it be as beautiful as wickham place   frieda asked    i should think it would  trust mr  wilcox for doing himself proud  all those ducie street houses are beautiful in their modern way  and i can t think why he doesn t keep on with it  but it s really for evie that he went there  and now that evie s going to be married      ah     you ve never seen miss wilcox  frieda  how absurdly matrimonial you are     but sister to that paul     yes     and to that charles   said mrs  munt with feeling   oh  helen  helen  what a time that was    helen laughed   meg and i haven t got such tender hearts  if there s a chance of a cheap house  we go for it     now look  frau liesecke  at my niece s train  you see  it is coming towards us  coming  coming  and  when it gets to corfe  it will actually go through the downs  on which we are standing  so that  if we walk over  as i suggested  and look down on swanage  we shall see it coming on the other side  shall we    frieda assented  and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser  rather a dull valley lay below  backed by the slope of the coastward downs  they were looking across the isle of purbeck and on to swanage  soon to be the most important town of all  and ugliest of the three  margaret s train reappeared as promised  and was greeted with approval by her aunt  it came to a standstill in the middle distance  and there it had been planned that tibby should meet her  and drive her  and a tea basket  up to join them    you see   continued helen to her cousin   the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles  they have  one  ducie street  two  howards end  where my great rumpus was  three  a country seat in shropshire  four  charles has a house in hilton  and five  another near epsom  and six  evie will have a house when she marries  and probably a pied a terre in the country  which makes seven  oh yes  and paul a hut in africa makes eight  i wish we could get howards end  that was something like a dear little house  didn t you think so  aunt juley     i had too much to do  dear  to look at it   said mrs  munt  with a gracious dignity   i had everything to settle and explain  and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides  it isn t likely i should remember much  i just remember having lunch in your bedroom     yes  so do i  but  oh dear  dear  how dreadful it all seems  and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement  you  and frieda  and meg  and mrs  wilcox  all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul     you yet may   said frieda despondently   helen shook her head   the great wilcox peril will never return  if i m certain of anything it s of that     one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions    the remark fell damply on the conversation  but helen slipped her arm round her cousin  somehow liking her the better for making it  it was not an original remark  nor had frieda appropriated it passionately  for she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind  yet it betrayed that interest in the universal which the average teuton possesses and the average englishman does not  it was  however illogically  the good  the beautiful  the true  as opposed to the respectable  the pretty  the adequate  it was a landscape of bocklin s beside a landscape of leader s  strident and ill considered  but quivering into supernatural life  it sharpened idealism  stirred the soul  it may have been a bad preparation for what followed    look   cried aunt juley  hurrying away from generalities over the narrow summit of the down   stand where i stand  and you will see the pony cart coming  i see the pony cart coming    they stood and saw the pony cart coming  margaret and tibby were presently seen coming in it  leaving the outskirts of swanage  it drove for a little through the budding lanes  and then began the ascent    have you got the house   they shouted  long before she could possibly hear   helen ran down to meet her  the highroad passed over a saddle  and a track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down    have you got the house    margaret shook her head    oh  what a nuisance  so we re as we were     not exactly    she got out  looking tired    some mystery   said tibby   we are to be enlightened presently    margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal of marriage from mr  wilcox   helen was amused  she opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through   it s just like a widower   she remarked   they ve cheek enough for anything  and invariably select one of their first wife s friends    margaret s face flashed despair    that type    she broke off with a cry   meg  not anything wrong with you     wait one minute   said margaret  whispering always    but you ve never conceivably  you ve never    she pulled herself together   tibby  hurry up through  i can t hold this gate indefinitely  aunt juley  i say  aunt juley  make the tea  will you  and frieda  we ve got to talk houses  and will come on afterwards   and then  turning her face to her sister s  she burst into tears   margaret was stupefied  she heard herself saying   oh  really    she felt herself touched with a hand that trembled    don t   sobbed helen   don t  don t  meg  don t   she seemed incapable of saying any other word  margaret  trembling herself  led her forward up the road  till they strayed through another gate on to the down    don t  don t do such a thing  i tell you not to  don t  i know  don t     what do you know     panic and emptiness   sobbed helen   don t    then margaret thought   helen is a little selfish  i have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying   she said   but we would still see each other very  often  and you      it s not a thing like that   sobbed helen  and she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards  stretching her hands towards the view and crying    what s happened to you   called margaret  following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills   but it s stupid   and suddenly stupidity seized her  and the immense landscape was blurred  but helen turned back    i don t know what s happened to either of us   said margaret  wiping her eyes   we must both have gone mad   then helen wiped hers  and they even laughed a little    look here  sit down     all right  i ll sit down if you ll sit down     there   one kiss   now  whatever  whatever is the matter     i do mean what i said  don t  it wouldn t do     oh  helen  stop saying  don t   it s ignorant  it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime   don t  is probably what mrs  bast says all the day to mr  bast    helen was silent    well     tell me about it first  and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime     that s better  well  where shall i begin  when i arrived at waterloo  no  i ll go back before that  because i m anxious you should know everything from the first  the  first  was about ten days ago  it was the day mr  bast came to tea and lost his temper  i

19,19,4330,4442,4554,"

Margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the
world s waters, when Love, who seems so tiny a pebble, slips in. Whom
does Love concern beyond the beloved and the lover? Yet his impact
deluges a hundred shores. No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit
of the generations, welcoming the new generation, and chafing against
the ultimate Fate, who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand. But
Love cannot understand this. He cannot comprehend another s infinity; he
is conscious only of his own--flying sunbeam, falling rose, pebble that
asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and
time. He knows that he will survive at the end of things, and be
gathered by Fate as a jewel from the slime, and be handed with
admiration round the assembly of the gods.  Men did produce this 
 they will say, and, saying, they will give men immortality. But
meanwhile--what agitations meanwhile! The foundations of Property and
Propriety are laid bare, twin rocks; Family Pride flounders to the
surface, puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted; Theology,
vaguely ascetic, gets up a nasty ground swell. Then the lawyers are
aroused--cold brood--and creep out of their holes. They do what they
can; they tidy up Property and Propriety, reassure Theology and Family
Pride. Half-guineas are poured on the troubled waters, the lawyers creep
back, and, if all has gone well, Love joins one man and woman together
in Matrimony.

Margaret had expected the disturbance, and was not irritated by it.
For a sensitive woman she had steady nerves, and could bear with the
incongruous and the grotesque; and, besides, there was nothing excessive
about her love-affair. Good-humour was the dominant note of her
relations with Mr. Wilcox, or, as I must now call him, Henry. Henry
did not encourage romance, and she was no girl to fidget for it. An
acquaintance had become a lover, might become a husband, but would
retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance; and love must confirm
an old relation rather than reveal a new one.

In this spirit she promised to marry him.

He was in Swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring.

They greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed
Aunt Juley. Henry dined at The Bays, but had engaged a bedroom in the
principal hotel; he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by
instinct. After dinner he asked Margaret if she wouldn t care for a turn
on the Parade. She accepted, and could not repress a little tremor; it
would be her first real love scene. But as she put on her hat she burst
out laughing. Love was so unlike the article served up in books; the
joy, though genuine was different; the mystery an unexpected mystery.
For one thing, Mr. Wilcox still seemed a stranger.

For a time they talked about the ring; then she said:  Do you remember
the Embankment at Chelsea? It can t be ten days ago. 

 Yes,  he said, laughing.  And you and your sister were head and ears
deep in some Quixotic scheme. Ah well! 

 I little thought then, certainly. Did you? 

 I don t know about that; I shouldn t like to say. 

 Why, was it earlier?  she cried.  Did you think of me this way earlier!
How extraordinarily interesting, Henry! Tell me. 

But Henry had no intention of telling. Perhaps he could not have told,
for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through
them. He misliked the very word  interesting,  connoting it with wasted
energy and even with morbidity. Hard facts were enough for him.

 I didn t think of it,  she pursued.  No; when you spoke to me in the
drawing-room, that was practically the first. It was all so different
from what it s supposed to be. On the stage, or in books, a proposal
is--how shall I put it?--a full-blown affair, a kind of bouquet;
it loses its literal meaning. But in life a proposal really is a
proposal-- 

 By the way-- 

 --a suggestion, a seed,  she concluded; and the thought flew away
into darkness.

 I was thinking, if you didn t mind, that we ought to spend this evening
in a business talk; there will be so much to settle. 

 I think so too.  Tell me, in the first place, how did you get on with Tibby? 

 With your brother? 

 Yes, during cigarettes. 

 Oh, very well. 

 I am so glad,  she answered, a little surprised.  What did you talk
about? Me, presumably. 

 About Greece too. 

 Greece was a very good card, Henry. Tibby s only a boy still, and one
has to pick and choose subjects a little. Well done. 

 I was telling him I have shares in a currant-farm near Calamata. 

 What a delightful thing to have shares in! Can t we go there for our
honeymoon? 

 What to do? 

 To eat the currants. And isn t there marvellous scenery? 

 Moderately, but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to
with a lady. 

 Why not? 

 No hotels. 

 Some ladies do without hotels. Are you aware that Helen and I have
walked alone over the Apennines, with our luggage on our backs? 

 I wasn t aware, and, if I can manage it, you will never do such a thing
again. 

She said more gravely:  You haven t found time for a talk with Helen
yet, I suppose? 

 No. 

 Do, before you go. I am so anxious you two should be friends. 

 Your sister and I have always hit it off,  he said negligently.  But
we re drifting away from our business. Let me begin at the beginning.
You know that Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill. 

 Dolly s uncle. 

 Exactly. The girl s madly in love with him. A very good sort of fellow,
but he demands--and rightly--a suitable provision with her. And in the
second place you will naturally understand, there is Charles. Before
leaving town, I wrote Charles a very careful letter. You see, he has
an increasing family and increasing expenses, and the I. and W. A. is
nothing particular just now, though capable of development. 

 Poor fellow!  murmured Margaret, looking out to sea, and not
understanding.

 Charles being the elder son, some day Charles will have Howards End;
but I am anxious, in my own happiness, not to be unjust to others. 

 Of course not,  she began, and then gave a little cry.  you mean money.
How stupid I am! Of course not! 

Oddly enough, he winced a little at the word.  Yes, Money, since you put
it so frankly. I am determined to be just to all--just to you, just to
them. I am determined that my children shall have me. 

 Be generous to them,  she said sharply.  Bother justice! 

 I am determined--and have already written to Charles to that effect-- 

 But how much have you got? 

 What? 

 How much have you a year? I ve six hundred. 

 My income? 

 Yes. We must begin with how much you have, before we can settle how
much you can give Charles. Justice, and even generosity, depend on
that. 

 I must say you re a downright young woman,  he observed, patting her
arm and laughing a little.  What a question to spring on a fellow! 

 Don t you know your income? Or don t you want to tell it me? 

 I-- 

 That s all right --now she patted him-- don t tell me. I don t want to
know. I can do the sum just as well by proportion. Divide your income
into ten parts. How many parts would you give to Evie, how many to
Charles, how many to Paul? 

 The fact is, my dear, I hadn t any intention of bothering you with
details. I only wanted to let you know that--well, that something must
be done for the others, and you ve understood me perfectly, so let s
pass on to the next point. 

 Yes, we ve settled that,  said Margaret, undisturbed by his strategic
blunderings.  Go ahead; give away all you can, bearing in mind that I ve
a clear six hundred. What a mercy it is to have all this money about
one. 

 We ve none too much, I assure you; you re marrying a poor man. 

 Helen wouldn t agree with me here,  she continued.  Helen daren t slang
the rich, being rich herself, but she would like to. There s an odd
notion, that I haven t yet got hold of, running about at the back of her
brain, that poverty is somehow  real.  She dislikes all organisation,
and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth. Sovereigns in
a stocking wouldn t bother her; cheques do. Helen is too relentless. One
can t deal in her high-handed manner with the world. 

 There s this other point, and then I must go back to my hotel and write
some letters. What s to be done now about the house in Ducie Street? 

 Keep it on--at least, it depends. When do you want to marry me? 

She raised her voice, as too often, and some youths, who were also
taking the evening air, overheard her.  Getting a bit hot, eh?  said
one. Mr. Wilcox turned on them, and said sharply,  I say!  There was
silence.  Take care I don t report you to the police.  They moved away
quietly enough, but were only biding their time, and the rest of the
conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter.

Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it, he said:
 Evie will probably be married in September. We could scarcely think of
anything before then. 

 The earlier the nicer, Henry. Females are not supposed to say such
things, but the earlier the nicer. 

 How about September for us too?  he asked, rather dryly.

 Right. Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September? Or shall
we try to bounce Helen and Tibby into it? That s rather an idea. They
are so unbusinesslike, we could make them do anything by judicious
management. Look here--yes. We ll do that. And we ourselves could live
at Howards End or Shropshire. 

He blew out his cheeks.  Heavens! how you women do fly round! My head s
in a whirl. Point by point, Margaret. Howards End s impossible. I let
it to Hamar Bryce on a three years  agreement last March. Don t you
remember? Oniton. Well, that is much, much too far away to rely on
entirely. You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain
amount, but we must have a house within easy reach of Town. Only Ducie
Street has huge drawbacks. There s a mews behind. 

Margaret could not help laughing. It was the first she had heard of
the mews behind Ducie Street. When she was a possible tenant it had
suppressed itself, not consciously, but automatically. The breezy
Wilcox manner, though genuine, lacked the clearness of vision that is
imperative for truth. When Henry lived in Ducie Street he remembered
the mews; when he tried to let he forgot it; and if any one had remarked
that the mews must be either there or not, he would have felt annoyed,
and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatising the speaker
as academic. So does my grocer stigmatise me when I complain of the
quality of his sultanas, and he answers in one breath that they are the
best sultanas, and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price? It
is a flaw inherent in the business mind, and Margaret may do well to
be tender to it, considering all that the business mind has done for
England.

 Yes, in summer especially, the mews is a serious nuisance. The
smoking-room, too, is an abominable little den. The house opposite
has been taken by operatic people. Ducie Street s going down, it s my
private opinion. 

 How sad! It s only a few years since they built those pretty houses. 

 Shows things are moving. Good for trade. 

 I hate this continual flux of London. It is an epitome of us at
our worst--eternal formlessness; all the qualities, good, bad, and
indifferent, streaming away--streaming, streaming for ever. That s why I
dread it so. I mistrust rivers, even in scenery. Now, the sea-- 

 High tide, yes. 

 Hoy toid --from the promenading youths.

 And these are the men to whom we give the vote,  observed Mr. Wilcox,
omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as
clerks--work that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men.
 However, they have their own lives and interests. Let s get on. 

He turned as he spoke, and prepared to see her back to The Bays. The
business was over. His hotel was in the opposite direction, and if he
accompanied her his letters would be late for the post. She implored him
not to come, but he was obdurate.

 A nice beginning, if your aunt saw you slip in alone! 

 But I always do go about alone. Considering I ve walked over the
Apennines, it s common sense. You will make me so angry. I don t the
least take it as a compliment. 

He laughed, and lit a cigar.  It isn t meant as a compliment, my dear. I
just won t have you going about in the dark. Such people about too! It s
dangerous. 

 Can t I look after myself? I do wish-- 

 Come along, Margaret; no wheedling. 

A younger woman might have resented his masterly ways, but Margaret
had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss. She was, in her own way, as
masterly. If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak, whom all might
tread, but whom the snows made nightly virginal. Disdaining the heroic
outfit, excitable in her methods, garrulous, episodical, shrill,
she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt. He mistook her
fertility for Weakness. He supposed her  as clever as they make them, 
 but no more, not realising that she was penetrating to the depths of his
soul, and approving of what she found there.

And if insight were sufficient, if the inner life were the whole of
life, their happiness had been assured.

They walked ahead briskly. The parade and the road after it were well
lighted, but it was darker in Aunt Juley s garden. As they were going
up by the side-paths, through some rhododendrons, Mr. Wilcox, who was
in front, said  Margaret  rather huskily, turned, dropped his cigar, and
took her in his arms.

She was startled, and nearly screamed, but recovered herself at once,
and kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own.
It was their first kiss, and when it was over he saw her safely to the
door and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the
maid answered it. On looking back, the incident displeased her. It was
so isolated. Nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it,
and, worse still, no tenderness had ensued. If a man cannot lead up to
passion he can at all events lead down from it, and she had hoped,
after her complaisance, for some interchange of gentle words. But he had
hurried away as if ashamed, and for an instant she was reminded of Helen
and Paul.

",margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the world s waters  when love  who seems so tiny a pebble  slips in  whom does love concern beyond the beloved and the lover  yet his impact deluges a hundred shores  no doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations  welcoming the new generation  and chafing against the ultimate fate  who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand  but love cannot understand this  he cannot comprehend another s infinity  he is conscious only of his own  flying sunbeam  falling rose  pebble that asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and time  he knows that he will survive at the end of things  and be gathered by fate as a jewel from the slime  and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods   men did produce this   they will say  and  saying  they will give men immortality  but meanwhile  what agitations meanwhile  the foundations of property and propriety are laid bare  twin rocks  family pride flounders to the surface  puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted  theology  vaguely ascetic  gets up a nasty ground swell  then the lawyers are aroused  cold brood  and creep out of their holes  they do what they can  they tidy up property and propriety  reassure theology and family pride  half guineas are poured on the troubled waters  the lawyers creep back  and  if all has gone well  love joins one man and woman together in matrimony   margaret had expected the disturbance  and was not irritated by it  for a sensitive woman she had steady nerves  and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque  and  besides  there was nothing excessive about her love affair  good humour was the dominant note of her relations with mr  wilcox  or  as i must now call him  henry  henry did not encourage romance  and she was no girl to fidget for it  an acquaintance had become a lover  might become a husband  but would retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance  and love must confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one   in this spirit she promised to marry him   he was in swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring   they greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed aunt juley  henry dined at the bays  but had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel  he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by instinct  after dinner he asked margaret if she wouldn t care for a turn on the parade  she accepted  and could not repress a little tremor  it would be her first real love scene  but as she put on her hat she burst out laughing  love was so unlike the article served up in books  the joy  though genuine was different  the mystery an unexpected mystery  for one thing  mr  wilcox still seemed a stranger   for a time they talked about the ring  then she said   do you remember the embankment at chelsea  it can t be ten days ago     yes   he said  laughing   and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme  ah well     i little thought then  certainly  did you     i don t know about that  i shouldn t like to say     why  was it earlier   she cried   did you think of me this way earlier  how extraordinarily interesting  henry  tell me    but henry had no intention of telling  perhaps he could not have told  for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them  he misliked the very word  interesting   connoting it with wasted energy and even with morbidity  hard facts were enough for him    i didn t think of it   she pursued   no  when you spoke to me in the drawing room  that was practically the first  it was all so different from what it s supposed to be  on the stage  or in books  a proposal is  how shall i put it   a full blown affair  a kind of bouquet  it loses its literal meaning  but in life a proposal really is a proposal      by the way        a suggestion  a seed   she concluded  and the thought flew away into darkness    i was thinking  if you didn t mind  that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk  there will be so much to settle     i think so too   tell me  in the first place  how did you get on with tibby     with your brother     yes  during cigarettes     oh  very well     i am so glad   she answered  a little surprised   what did you talk about  me  presumably     about greece too     greece was a very good card  henry  tibby s only a boy still  and one has to pick and choose subjects a little  well done     i was telling him i have shares in a currant farm near calamata     what a delightful thing to have shares in  can t we go there for our honeymoon     what to do     to eat the currants  and isn t there marvellous scenery     moderately  but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady     why not     no hotels     some ladies do without hotels  are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines  with our luggage on our backs     i wasn t aware  and  if i can manage it  you will never do such a thing again    she said more gravely   you haven t found time for a talk with helen yet  i suppose     no     do  before you go  i am

enough  he winced a little at the word   yes  money  since you put it so frankly  i am determined to be just to all  just to you  just to them  i am determined that my children shall have me     be

Charles had just been scolding his Dolly. She deserved the scolding, and
had bent before it, but her head, though bloody was unsubdued and her
chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder.

 You ve waked the baby. I knew you would. (Rum-ti-foo,
Rackety-tackety-Tompkin!) I m not responsible for what Uncle Percy does,
nor for anybody else or anything, so there! 

 Who asked him while I was away? Who asked my sister down to meet him?
Who sent them out in the motor day after day? 

 Charles, that reminds me of some poem. 

 Does it indeed? We shall all be dancing to a very different music
presently. Miss Schlegel has fairly got us on toast. 

 I could simply scratch that woman s eyes out, and to say it s my fault
is most unfair. 

 It s your fault, and five months ago you admitted it. 

 I didn t. 

 You did. 

 Tootle, tootle, playing on the pootle!  exclaimed Dolly, suddenly
devoting herself to the child.

 It s all very well to turn the conversation, but father would
never have dreamt of marrying as long as Evie was there to make him
comfortable. But you must needs start match-making. Besides, Cahill s
too old. 

 Of course, if you re going to be rude to Uncle Percy. 

 Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of Howards End, and, thanks to
you, she s got it. 

 I call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most
unfair. You couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting.
Could he, diddums? 

 We re in a bad hole, and must make the best of it. I shall answer the
pater s letter civilly. He s evidently anxious to do the decent thing.
But I do not intend to forget these Schlegels in a hurry. As long
as they re on their best behaviour--Dolly, are you listening?--we ll
behave, too. But if I find them giving themselves airs or monopolising
my father, or at all ill-treating him, or worrying him with their
artistic beastliness, I intend to put my foot down, yes, firmly. Taking
my mother s place! Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the
news reaches him. 

The interlude closes. It has taken place in Charles s garden at Hilton.
He and Dolly are sitting in deckchairs, and their motor is regarding
them placidly from its garage across the lawn. A short-frocked edition
of Charles also regards them placidly; a perambulator edition is

Margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow. Mature
as he was, she might yet be able to help him to the building of the
rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion.
Without it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts,
unconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is
born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the grey, sober
against the fire. Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of
these outspread wings. The roads of his soul lie clear, and he and his
friends shall find easy-going.

It was hard-going in the roads of Mr. Wilcox s soul. From boyhood he
had neglected them.  I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside. 
 Outwardly he was cheerful, reliable, and brave; but within, all
had reverted to chaos, ruled, so far as it was ruled at all, by an
incomplete asceticism. Whether as boy, husband, or widower, he had
always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad, a belief that is
desirable only when held passionately. Religion had confirmed him. The
words that were read aloud on Sunday to him and to other respectable men
were the words that had once kindled the souls of St. Catherine and St.
Francis into a white-hot hatred of the carnal. He could not be as the
saints and love the Infinite with a seraphic ardour, but he could be a
little ashamed of loving a wife. Amabat, amare timebat. And it was here
that Margaret hoped to help him.

It did not seem so difficult. She need trouble him with no gift of her
own. She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own
soul, and in the soul of every man. Only connect! That was the whole
of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be
exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no
longer. Only connect and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation
that is life to either, will die.

Nor was the message difficult to give. It need not take the form of a
good  talking.  By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span
their lives with beauty.

But she failed. For there was one quality in Henry for which she was
never prepared, however much she reminded herself of it: his obtuseness.
He simply did not notice things, and there was no more to be said. He
never noticed that Helen and Frieda were hostile, or that Tibby was
not interested in currant plantations; he never noticed the lights and
shades that exist in the greyest conversation, the finger-posts, the
milestones, the collisions, the illimitable views. Once--on another
occasion--she scolded him about it. He was puzzled, but replied with a
laugh:  My motto is Concentrate. I ve no intention of frittering away
my strength on that sort of thing.   It isn t frittering away the
strength,  she protested.  It s enlarging the space in which you may
be strong.  He answered:  You re a clever little woman, but my motto s
Concentrate.  And this morning he concentrated with a vengeance.

They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday. In the daylight the bushes
were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun. She was
with Helen, who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled.
 Here we all are!  she cried, and took him by one hand, retaining her
sister s in the other.

 Here we are. Good-morning, Helen. 

Helen replied,  Good-morning, Mr. Wilcox. 

 Henry, she has had such a nice letter from the queer, cross boy. Do
you remember him? He had a sad moustache, but the back of his head was
young. 

 I have had a letter too. Not a nice one--I want to talk it over with
you ; for Leonard Bast was nothing to him now that she had given him her
word; the triangle of sex was broken for ever.

 Thanks to your hint, he s clearing out of the Porphyrion. 

 Not a bad business that Porphyrion,  he said absently, as he took his
own letter out of his pocket.

 Not a BAD--  she exclaimed, dropping his hand.  Surely, on Chelsea
Embankment-- 

 Here s our hostess. Good-morning, Mrs. Munt. Fine rhododendrons.
Good-morning, Frau Liesecke; we manage to grow flowers in England, don t
we? 

 Not a BAD business? 

 No. My letter s about Howards End. Bryce has been ordered abroad, and
wants to sublet it--I am far from sure that I shall give him permission.
There was no clause in the agreement. In my opinion, subletting is a
mistake. If he can find me another tenant, whom I consider suitable,
I may cancel the agreement. Morning, Schlegel. Don t you think that s
better than subletting? 

Helen had dropped her hand now, and he had steered her past the whole
party to the seaward side of the house. Beneath them was the bourgeois
little bay, which must have yearned all through the centuries for just
such a watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin.

The waves were colourless, and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further
touch of insipidity, drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for
excursionists.

 When there is a sublet I find that damage-- 

 Do excuse me, but about the Porphyrion. I don t feel easy--might I just
bother you, Henry? 

Her manner was so serious that he stopped, and asked her a little
sharply what she wanted.

 You said on Chelsea Embankment, surely, that it was a bad concern, so
we advised this clerk to clear out. He writes this morning that he s
taken our advice, and now you say it s not a bad concern. 

 A clerk who clears out of any concern, good or bad, without securing a
berth somewhere else first, is a fool, and I ve no pity for him. 

 He has not done that. He s going into a bank in Camden Town, he says.
The salary s much lower, but he hopes to manage--a branch of Dempster s
Bank. Is that all right? 

 Dempster! Why goodness me, yes. 

 More right than the Porphyrion? 

 Yes, yes, yes; safe as houses--safer. 

 Very many thanks. I m sorry--if you sublet--? 

 If he sublets, I shan t have the same control. In theory there should
be no more damage done at Howards End; in practice there will be. Things
may be done for which no money can compensate. For instance, I shouldn t
want that fine wych-elm spoilt. It hangs--Margaret, we must go and see
the old place some time. It s pretty in its way. We ll motor down and
have lunch with Charles. 

 I should enjoy that,  said Margaret bravely.

 What about next Wednesday? 

 Wednesday? No, I couldn t well do that. Aunt Juley expects us to stop
here another week at least. 

 But you can give that up now. 

 Er--no,  said Margaret, after a moment s thought.

 Oh, that ll be all right. I ll speak to her. 

 This visit is a high solemnity. My aunt counts on it year after
year. She turns the house upside down for us; she invites our special
friends--she scarcely knows Frieda, and we can t leave her on her hands.
I missed one day, and she would be so hurt if I didn t stay the full
ten. 

 But I ll say a word to her. Don t you bother. 

 Henry, I won t go. Don t bully me. 

 You want to see the house, though? 

 Very much--I ve heard so much about it, one way or the other. Aren t
there pigs  teeth in the wych-elm? 

 PIGS TEETH? 

 And you chew the bark for toothache. 

 What a rum notion! Of course not! 

 Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree. There are still a
great number of sacred trees in England, it seems. 

But he left her to intercept Mrs. Munt, whose voice could be heard in
the distance; to be intercepted himself by Helen.

 Oh. Mr. Wilcox, about the Porphyrion--  she began and went scarlet all
over her face.

 It s all right,  called Margaret, catching them up.  Dempster s Bank s
better. 

 But I think you told us the Porphyrion was bad, and would smash before
Christmas. 

 Did I? It was still outside the Tariff Ring, and had to take rotten
policies. Lately it came in--safe as houses now. 

 In other words, Mr. Bast need never have left it. 

 No, the fellow needn t. 

 --and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary. 

 He only says  reduced,   corrected Margaret, seeing trouble ahead.

 With a man so poor, every reduction must be great. I consider it a
deplorable misfortune. 

Mr. Wilcox, intent on his business with Mrs. Munt, was going steadily
on, but the last remark made him say:  What? What s that? Do you mean
that I m responsible? 

 You re ridiculous, Helen. 

 You seem to think--  He looked at his watch.  Let me explain the point
to you. It is like this. You seem to assume, when a business concern is
conducting a delicate negotiation, it ought to keep the public informed
stage by stage. The Porphyrion, according to you, was bound to say,  I
am trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring. I am not sure that
I shall succeed, but it is the only thing that will save me from
insolvency, and I am trying.  My dear Helen-- 

 Is that your point? A man who had little money has less--that s mine. 

 I am grieved for your clerk. But it is all in the day s work. It s part
of the battle of life. 

 A man who had little money--  she repeated,  has less, owing to
us. Under these circumstances I consider  the battle of life  a happy
expression. 

 Oh come, come!  he protested pleasantly,  you re not to blame. No one s
to blame. 

 Is no one to blame for anything? 

 I wouldn t say that, but you re taking it far too seriously. Who is
this fellow? 

 We have told you about the fellow twice already,  said Helen.  You
have even met the fellow. He is very poor and his wife is an
extravagant imbecile. He is capable of better things. We--we, the upper
classes--thought we would help him from the height of our superior
knowledge--and here s the result! 

He raised his finger.  Now, a word of advice. 

 I require no more advice. 

 A word of advice. Don t take up that sentimental attitude over the
poor. See that she doesn t, Margaret. The poor are poor, and one s sorry
for them, but there it is. As civilisation moves forward, the shoe is
bound to pinch in places, and it s absurd to pretend that any one is
responsible personally. Neither you, nor I, nor my informant, nor the
man who informed him, nor the directors of the Porphyrion, are to blame
for this clerk s loss of salary. It s just the shoe pinching--no one can
help it; and it might easily have been worse. 

Helen quivered with indignation.

 By all means subscribe to charities--subscribe to them largely--but
don t get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform. I see a good
deal behind the scenes, and you can take it from me that there is no
Social Question--except for a few journalists who try to get a living
out of the phrase. There are just rich and poor, as there always have
been and always will be. Point me out a time when men have been equal-- 

 I didn t say-- 

 Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier. No,
no. You can t. There always have been rich and poor. I m no fatalist.
Heaven forbid! But our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal
forces  (his voice grew complacent; it always did when he eliminated the
personal),  and there always will be rich and poor. You can t deny it 
 (and now it was a respectful voice)-- and you can t deny that, in spite
of all, the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward. 

 Owing to God, I suppose,  flashed Helen.

He stared at her.

 You grab the dollars. God does the rest. 

It was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about God
in that neurotic modern way. Fraternal to the last, he left her for
the quieter company of Mrs. Munt. He thought,  She rather reminds me of
Dolly. 

Helen looked out at the sea.

 Don t ever discuss political economy with Henry,  advised her sister.
 It ll only end in a cry. 

 But he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with
religion,  said Helen slowly.  I don t like those men. They are
scientific themselves, and talk of the survival of the fittest, and cut
down the salaries of their clerks, and stunt the independence of all who
may menace their comfort, but yet they believe that somehow good--it
is always that sloppy  somehow  will be the outcome, and that in some
mystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the Mr.
Brits of today are in pain. 

 He is such a man in theory. But oh, Helen, in theory! 

 But oh, Meg, what a theory! 

 Why should you put things so bitterly, dearie? 

 Because I m an old maid,  said Helen, biting her lip.  I can t think
why I go on like this myself.  She shook off her sister s hand and went
into the house. Margaret, distressed at the day s beginning, followed
the Bournemouth steamer with her eyes. She saw that Helen s nerves
were exasperated by the unlucky Bast business beyond the bounds of
politeness. There might at any minute be a real explosion, which even
Henry would notice. Henry must be removed.

 Margaret!  her aunt called.  Magsy! It isn t true, surely, what Mr.
Wilcox says, that you want to go away early next week? 

 Not  want,   was Margaret s prompt reply;  but there is so much to be
settled, and I do want to see the Charles s. 

 But going away without taking the Weymouth trip, or even the Lulworth? 
 said Mrs. Munt, coming nearer.  Without going once more up Nine Barrows
Down? 

 I m afraid so. 

Mr. Wilcox rejoined her with,  Good! I did the breaking of the ice. 

A wave of tenderness came over her. She put a hand on either shoulder,
and looked deeply into the black, bright eyes. What was behind their
competent stare? She knew, but was not disquieted.

22,22,4808,4922,5037,"

Margaret had no intention of letting things slide, and the evening
before she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding. She
censured her, not for disapproving of the engagement, but for throwing
over her disapproval a veil of mystery. Helen was equally frank.  Yes, 
 she said, with the air of one looking inwards,  there is a mystery.
I can t help it. It s not my fault. It s the way life has been made. 
 Helen in those days was over-interested in the subconscious self. She
exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life, and spoke of mankind as
puppets, whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war. Margaret
pointed out that if she dwelt on this she, too, would eliminate the
personal. Helen was silent for a minute, and then burst into a queer
speech, which cleared the air.  Go on and marry him. I think you re
splendid; and if any one can pull it off, you will.  Margaret denied
that there was anything to  pull off,  but she continued:  Yes, there
is, and I wasn t up to it with Paul. I can do only what s easy. I
can only entice and be enticed. I can t, and won t, attempt difficult
relations. If I marry, it will either be a man who s strong enough to
boss me or whom I m strong enough to boss. So I shan t ever marry, for
there aren t such men. And Heaven help any one whom I do marry, for I
shall certainly run away from him before you can say  Jack Robinson. 
There! Because I m uneducated. But you, you re different; you re a
heroine. 

 Oh, Helen! Am I? Will it be as dreadful for poor Henry as all that? 

 You mean to keep proportion, and that s heroic, it s Greek, and I don t
see why it shouldn t succeed with you. Go on and fight with him and help
him. Don t ask me for help, or even for sympathy. Henceforward I m going
my own way. I mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy. I
mean to dislike your husband, and to tell him so. I mean to make no
concessions to Tibby. If Tibby wants to live with me, he must lump me.
I mean to love you more than ever. Yes, I do. You and I have built
up something real, because it is purely spiritual. There s no veil of
mystery over us. Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the
body. The popular view is, as usual, exactly the wrong one. Our bothers
are over tangible things--money, husbands, house-hunting. But Heaven
will work of itself. 

Margaret was grateful for this expression of affection, and answered,
 Perhaps.  All vistas close in the unseen--no one doubts it--but Helen
closed them rather too quickly for her taste. At every turn of speech
one was confronted with reality and the absolute. Perhaps Margaret grew
too old for metaphysics, perhaps Henry was weaning her from them, but
she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that
so readily shreds the visible. The business man who assumes that this
life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail,
on this side and on that, to hit the truth.  Yes, I see, dear; it s
about half-way between,  Aunt Juley had hazarded in earlier years. No;
truth, being alive, was not half-way between anything. It was only to be
found by continuous excursions into either realm, and though proportion
is the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.

Helen, agreeing here, disagreeing there, would have talked till
midnight, but Margaret, with her packing to do, focussed the
conversation on Henry. She might abuse Henry behind his back, but please
would she always be civil to him in company?  I definitely dislike
him, but I ll do what I can,  promised Helen.  Do what you can with my
friends in return. 

This conversation made Margaret easier. Their inner life was so safe
that they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been
incredible to Aunt Juley, and impossible for Tibby or Charles. There
are moments when the inner life actually  pays,  when years of
self-scrutiny, conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of
practical use. Such moments are still rare in the West; that they come
at all promises a fairer future. Margaret, though unable to understand
her sister, was assured against estrangement, and returned to London
with a more peaceful mind.

The following morning, at eleven o clock, she presented herself at the
offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company. She was glad to
go there, for Henry had implied his business rather than described
it, and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa
itself had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth.
Not that a visit to the office cleared things up. There was just the
ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars
that began and stopped for no possible reason, of electric-light globes
blossoming in triplets, of little rabbit-hutches faced with glass or
wire, of little rabbits. And even when she penetrated to the inner
depths, she found only the ordinary table and Turkey carpet, and though
the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa, it was
a very ordinary map. Another map hung opposite, on which the whole
continent appeared, looking like a whale marked out for a blubber,
and by its side was a door, shut, but Henry s voice came through it,
dictating a  strong  letter. She might have been at the Porphyrion, or
Dempster s Bank, or her own wine-merchant s. Everything seems just
alike in these days. But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial side of the
company rather than its West African, and Imperialism always had been
one of her difficulties.

 One minute!  called Mr. Wilcox on receiving her name. He touched a
bell, the effect of which was to produce Charles.

Charles had written his father an adequate letter--more adequate than
Evie s, through which a girlish indignation throbbed. And he greeted his
future stepmother with propriety.

 I hope that my wife--how do you do?--will give you a decent lunch,  was
his opening.  I left instructions, but we live in a rough-and-ready way.
She expects you back to tea, too, after you have had a look at Howards
End. I wonder what you ll think of the place. I wouldn t touch it with
tongs myself. Do sit down! It s a measly little place. 

 I shall enjoy seeing it,  said Margaret, feeling, for the first time,
shy.

 You ll see it at its worst, for Bryce decamped abroad last Monday
without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him. I never
saw such a disgraceful mess. It s unbelievable. He wasn t in the house a
month. 

 I ve more than a little bone to pick with Bryce,  called Henry from the
inner chamber.

 Why did he go so suddenly? 

 Invalid type; couldn t sleep. 

 Poor fellow! 

 Poor fiddlesticks!  said Mr. Wilcox, joining them.  He had the
impudence to put up notice-boards without as much as saying with your
leave or by your leave. Charles flung them down. 

 Yes, I flung them down,  said Charles modestly.

 I ve sent a telegram after him, and a pretty sharp one, too. He, and
he in person, is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next
three years. 

 The keys are at the farm; we wouldn t have the keys. 

 Quite right. 

 Dolly would have taken them, but I was in, fortunately. 

 What s Mr. Bryce like?  asked Margaret.

But nobody cared. Mr. Bryce was the tenant, who had no right to sublet;
to have defined him further was a waste of time. On his misdeeds they
descanted profusely, until the girl who had been typing the strong
letter came out with it. Mr. Wilcox added his signature.  Now we ll be
off,  said he.

A motor-drive, a form of felicity detested by Margaret, awaited her.
Charles saw them in, civil to the last, and in a moment the offices of
the Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away. But it was not
an impressive drive. Perhaps the weather was to blame, being grey
and banked high with weary clouds. Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely
intended for motorists. Did not a gentleman once motor so quickly
through Westmoreland that he missed it? and if Westmoreland can
be missed, it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure
particularly needs the attentive eye. Hertfordshire is England at
its quietest, with little emphasis of river and hill; it is England
meditative. If Drayton were with us again to write a new edition of
his incomparable poem, he would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire as
indeterminate of feature, with hair obfuscated by the London smoke.
Their eyes would be sad, and averted from their fate towards the
Northern flats, their leader not Isis or Sabrina, but the slowly flowing
Lea. No glory of raiment would be theirs, no urgency of dance; but they
would be real nymphs.

The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped, for the Great
North Road was full of Easter traffic. But he went quite quick enough
for Margaret, a poor-spirited creature, who had chickens and children on
the brain.

 They re all right,  said Mr. Wilcox.  They ll learn--like the swallows
and the telegraph-wires. 

 Yes, but, while they re learning-- 

 The motor s come to stay,  he answered.  One must get about. There s a
pretty church--oh, you aren t sharp enough. Well, look out, if the road
worries you--right outward at the scenery. 

She looked at the scenery. It heaved and merged like porridge. Presently
it congealed. They had arrived.

Charles s house on the left; on the right the swelling forms of the
Six Hills. Their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her. They
interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards
Hilton. Beyond them she saw meadows and a wood, and beneath them she
settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried. She hated war and
liked soldiers--it was one of her amiable inconsistencies.

But here was Dolly, dressed up to the nines, standing at the door to
greet them, and here were the first drops of the rain. They ran in
gaily, and after a long wait in the drawing-room, sat down to the
rough-and-ready lunch, every dish of which concealed or exuded cream.
Mr. Bryce was the chief topic of conversation. Dolly described his visit
with the key, while her father-in-law gave satisfaction by chaffing her
and contradicting all she said. It was evidently the custom to laugh
at Dolly. He chaffed Margaret too, and Margaret roused from a grave
meditation was pleased and chaffed him back. Dolly seemed surprised and
eyed her curiously. After lunch the two children came down. Margaret
disliked babies, but hit it off better with the two-year-old, and sent
Dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him.  Kiss them now, and
come away,  said Mr. Wilcox. She came, but refused to kiss them; it
was such hard luck on the little things, she said, and though Dolly
proffered Chorly-worly and Porgly-woggles in turn, she was obdurate.

By this time it was raining steadily. The car came round with the
hood up, and again she lost all sense of space. In a few minutes they
stopped, and Crane opened the door of the car.

 What s happened?  asked Margaret.

 What do you suppose?  said Henry.

A little porch was close up against her face.

 Are we there already? 

 We are. 

 Well, I never! In years ago it seemed so far away. 

Smiling, but somehow disillusioned, she jumped out, and her impetus
carried her to the front-door. She was about to open it, when Henry
said:  That s no good; it s locked. Who s got the key? 

As he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm, no one
replied. He also wanted to know who had left the front gate open, since
a cow had strayed in from the road, and was spoiling the croquet lawn.
Then he said rather crossly:  Margaret, you wait in the dry. I ll go
down for the key. It isn t a hundred yards. 

 Mayn t I come too? 

 No; I shall be back before I m gone. 

Then the car turned away, and it was as if a curtain had risen. For the
second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth.

There were the greengage-trees that Helen had once described, there the
tennis lawn, there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in
June, but the vision now was of black and palest green. Down by the
dell-hole more vivid colours were awakening, and Lent lilies stood
sentinel on its margin, or advanced in battalions over the grass. Tulips
were a tray of jewels. She could not see the wych-elm tree, but a branch
of the celebrated vine, studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch.
She was struck by the fertility of the soil; she had seldom been in a
garden where the flowers looked so well, and even the weeds she was idly
plucking out of the porch were intensely green. Why had poor Mr. Bryce
fled from all this beauty? For she had already decided that the place
was beautiful.

 Naughty cow! Go away!  cried Margaret to the cow, but without
indignation.

Harder came the rain, pouring out of a windless sky, and spattering up
from the notice-boards of the house-agents, which lay in a row on the
lawn where Charles had hurled them. She must have interviewed Charles in
another world--where one did have interviews. How Helen would revel in
such a notion! Charles dead, all people dead, nothing alive but houses
and gardens. The obvious dead, the intangible alive, and no connection
at all between them! Margaret smiled. Would that her own fancies were
as clear-cut! Would that she could deal as high-handedly with the world!
Smiling and sighing, she laid her hand upon the door. It opened. The
house was not locked up at all.

She hesitated. Ought she to wait for Henry? He felt strongly about
property, and might prefer to show her over himself. On the other hand,
he had told her to keep in the dry, and the porch was beginning to drip.
So she went in, and the draught from inside slammed the door behind.

Desolation greeted her. Dirty finger-prints were on the hall-windows,
flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards. The civilisation of luggage
had been here for a month, and then decamped. Dining-room and
drawing-room--right and left--were guessed only by their wallpapers.
They were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain. Across the
ceiling of each ran a great beam. The dining-room and hall revealed
theirs openly, but the drawing-room s was match-boarded--because the
facts of life must be concealed from ladies? Drawing-room, dining-room,
and hall--how petty the names sounded! Here were simply three rooms
where children could play and friends shelter from the rain. Yes, and
they were beautiful.

Then she opened one of the doors opposite--there were two--and exchanged
wall-papers for whitewash. It was the servants  part, though she
scarcely realised that: just rooms again, where friends might shelter.
The garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums. Farther
on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines. Yes, the meadow
was beautiful.

Penned in by the desolate weather, she recaptured the sense of space
which the motor had tried to rob from her. She remembered again that ten
square miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile, that
a thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven. The
phantom of bigness, which London encourages, was laid for ever when she
paced from the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and heard the rain run
this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided it.

Now Helen came to her mind, scrutinising half Wessex from the ridge of
the Purbeck Downs, and saying:  You will have to lose something.  She
was not so sure. For instance she would double her kingdom by opening
the door that concealed the stairs.

Now she thought of the map of Africa; of empires; of her father; of
the two supreme nations, streams of whose life warmed her blood, but,
mingling, had cooled her brain. She paced back into the hall, and as she
did so the house reverberated.

 Is that you, Henry?  she called.

There was no answer, but the house reverberated again.

 Henry, have you got in? 

But it was the heart of the house beating, faintly at first, then
loudly, martially. It dominated the rain.

It is the starved imagination, not the well-nourished, that is afraid.
Margaret flung open the door to the stairs. A noise as of drums seemed
to deafen her. A woman, an old woman, was descending, with figure erect,
with face impassive, with lips that parted and said dryly:

 Oh! Well, I took you for Ruth Wilcox. 

Margaret stammered:  I--Mrs. Wilcox--I? 

 In fancy, of course--in fancy. You had her way of walking. Good-day. 
 And the old woman passed out into the rain.

descanted profusely  until the girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with it  mr  wilcox added his signature   now we ll be off   said he   a motor drive  a form of felicity detested by margaret  awaited her  charles saw them in  civil to the last  and in a moment the offices of the imperial and west african rubber company faded away  but it was not an impressive drive  perhaps the weather was to blame  being grey and banked high with weary clouds  perhaps hertfordshire is scarcely intended for motorists  did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through westmoreland that he missed it  and if westmoreland can be missed  it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye  hertfordshire is england at its quietest  with little emphasis of river and hill  it is england meditative  if drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem  he would sing the nymphs of hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature  with hair obfuscated by the london smoke  their eyes would be sad  and averted from their fate towards the northern flats  their leader not isis or sabrina  but the slowly flowing lea  no glory of raiment would be theirs  no urgency of dance  but they would be real nymphs   the chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped  for the great north road was full of easter traffic  but he went quite quick enough for margaret  a poor spirited creature  who had chickens and children on the brain    they re all right   said mr  wilcox   they ll learn  like the swallows and the telegraph wires     yes  but  while they re learning      the motor s come to stay   he answered   one must get about  there s a pretty church  oh  you aren t sharp enough  well  look out  if the road worries you  right outward at the scenery    she looked at the scenery  it heaved and merged like porridge  presently it congealed  they had arrived   charles s house on the left  on the right the swelling forms of the six hills  their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her  they interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards hilton  beyond them she saw meadows and a wood  and beneath them she settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried  she hated war and liked soldiers  it was one of her amiable inconsistencies   but here was dolly  dressed up to the nines  standing at the door to greet them  and here were the first drops of the rain  they ran in gaily  and after a long wait in the drawing room  sat down to the rough and ready lunch  every dish of which concealed or exuded cream  mr  bryce was the chief topic of conversation  dolly described his visit with the key  while her father in law gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all she said  it was evidently the custom to laugh at dolly  he chaffed margaret too  and margaret roused from a grave meditation was pleased and chaffed him back  dolly seemed surprised and eyed her curiously  after lunch the two children came down  margaret disliked babies  but hit it off better with the two year old  and sent dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him   kiss them now  and come away   said mr  wilcox  she came  but refused to kiss them  it was such hard luck on the little things  she said  and though dolly proffered chorly worly and porgly woggles in turn  she was obdurate   by this time it was raining steadily  the car came round with the hood up  and again she lost all sense of space  in a few minutes they stopped  and crane opened the door of the car    what s happened   asked margaret    what do you suppose   said henry   a little porch was close up against her face    are we there already     we are     well  i never  in years ago it seemed so far away    smiling  but somehow disillusioned  she jumped out  and her impetus carried her to the front door  she was about to open it  when henry said   that s no good  it s locked  who s got the key    as he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm  no one replied  he also wanted to know who had left the front gate open  since a cow had strayed in from the road  and was spoiling the croquet lawn  then he said rather crossly   margaret  you wait in the dry  i ll go down for the key  it isn t a hundred yards     mayn t i come too     no  i shall be back before i m gone    then the car turned away  and it was as if a curtain had risen  for the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth   there were the greengage trees that helen had once described  there the tennis lawn  there the hedge that would be glorious with dog roses in june  but the vision now was of black and palest green  down by the dell hole more vivid colours were awakening  and lent lilies stood sentinel on its margin  or advanced in battalions over the grass  tulips were a tray of jewels  she could not see the wych elm tree  but a branch of the celebrated vine  studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch  she was struck by the fertility of the soil  she had seldom been in a garden where the flowers looked so well  and even the weeds she was idly plucking out of the porch were intensely green  why had poor mr  bryce fled from all this beauty  for she had already decided that the place was beautiful    naughty cow  go away   cried margaret to the cow  but without indignation   harder came the rain  pouring out of a windless sky  and spattering up from the notice boards of the house agents  which lay in a row on the lawn where charles had hurled them  she must have interviewed charles in another world  where one did have interviews  how helen would revel in such a notion  charles dead  all people dead  nothing alive but houses and gardens  the obvious dead  the intangible alive  and no connection at all between them  margaret smiled  would that her own fancies were as clear cut  would that she could deal as high handedly with the world  smiling and sighing  she laid her hand upon the door  it opened  the house was not locked up at all   she hesitated  ought she to wait for henry  he felt strongly about property  and might prefer to show her over himself  on the other hand  he had told her to keep in the dry  and the porch was beginning to drip  so she went in  and the draught from inside slammed the door behind   desolation greeted her  dirty finger prints were on the hall windows  flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards  the civilisation of luggage had been here for a month  and then decamped  dining room and drawing room  right and left  were guessed only by their wallpapers  they were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain  across the ceiling of each ran a great beam  the dining room and hall revealed theirs openly  but the drawing room s was match boarded  because the facts of life must be concealed from ladies  drawing room  dining room  and hall  how petty the names sounded  here were simply three rooms where children could play and friends shelter from the rain  yes  and they were beautiful   then she opened one of the doors opposite  there were two  and exchanged wall papers for whitewash  it was the servants  part  though she scarcely realised that  just rooms again  where friends might shelter  the garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums  farther on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines  yes  the meadow was beautiful   penned in by the desolate weather  she recaptured the sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from her  she remembered again that ten square miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile  that a thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven  the phantom of bigness  which london encourages  was laid for ever when she paced from the hall at howards end to its kitchen and heard the rain run this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided it   now helen came to her mind  scrutinising half wessex from the ridge of the purbeck downs  and saying   you will have to lose something   she was not so sure  for instance she would double her kingdom by opening the door that concealed the stairs   now she thought of the map of africa  of empires  of her father  of the two supreme nations  streams of whose life warmed her blood  but  mingling  had cooled her brain  she paced back into the hall  and as she did so the house reverberated    is that you  henry   she called   there was no answer  but the house reverberated again    henry  have you got in    but it was the heart of the house beating  faintly at first  then loudly  martially  it dominated the rain   it is the starved imagination  not the well nourished  that is afraid  margaret flung open the door to the stairs  a noise as of drums seemed to deafen her  a woman  an old woman  was descending  with figure erect  with face impassive  with lips that parted and said dryly    oh  well  i took you for ruth wilcox    margaret stammered   i  mrs  wilcox  i     in fancy  of course  in fancy  you had her way of walking  good day    and the old woman passed out into the

 It gave her quite a turn,  said Mr. Wilcox, when retailing the incident
to Dolly at tea-time.  None of you girls have any nerves, really. Of
course, a word from me put it all right, but silly old Miss Avery--she
frightened you, didn t she, Margaret? There you stood clutching a bunch
of weeds. She might have said something, instead of coming down the
stairs with that alarming bonnet on. I passed her as I came in. Enough
to make the car shy. I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character;
some old maids do.  He lit a cigarette.  It is their last resource.
Heaven knows what she was doing in the place; but that s Bryce s
business, not mine. 

 I wasn t as foolish as you suggest,  said Margaret  She only startled
me, for the house had been silent so long. 

 Did you take her for a spook?  asked Dolly, for whom  spooks   and
 going to church  summarised the unseen.

 Not exactly. 

 She really did frighten you,  said Henry, who was far from discouraging
timidity in females.  Poor Margaret! And very naturally. Uneducated
classes are so stupid. 

 Is Miss Avery uneducated classes?  Margaret asked, and found herself
looking at the decoration scheme of Dolly s drawing-room.

 She s just one of the crew at the farm. People like that always assume
things. She assumed you d know who she was. She left all the Howards End
keys in the front lobby, and assumed that you d seen them as you came
in, that you d lock up the house when you d done, and would bring them
on down to her. And there was her niece hunting for them down at the
farm. Lack of education makes people very casual. Hilton was full of
women like Miss Avery once. 

 I shouldn t have disliked it, perhaps. 

 Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present,  said Dolly.

Which was illogical but interesting. Through Dolly, Margaret was
destined to learn a good deal.

 But Charles said I must try not to mind, because she had known his
grandmother. 

 As usual, you ve got the story wrong, my good Dorothea. 

 I meant great-grandmother--the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house.
Weren t both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End, too, was a
farm? 

Her father-in-law blew out a shaft of smoke. His attitude to his dead
wife was curious. He would allude to her, and hear her discussed, but
never mentioned her by name. Nor was he interested in the dim, bucolic
past. Dolly was--for the following reason.

 Then hadn t Mrs. Wilcox a brother--or was it an uncle? Anyhow, he
popped the question, and Miss Avery, she said  No.  Just imagine, if
she d said  Yes,  she would have been Charles s aunt. (Oh, I say,
that s rather good!  Charlie s Aunt ! I must chaff him about that this
evening.) And the man went out and was killed. Yes, I m certain I ve
got it right now. Tom Howard--he was the last of them. 

 I believe so,  said Mr. Wilcox negligently.

 I say! Howards End--Howards Ended!  cried Dolly.  I m rather on the
spot this evening, eh? 

 I wish you d ask whether Crane s ended. 

 Oh, Mr. Wilcox, how can you? 

 Because, if he has had enough tea, we ought to go--Dolly s a good
little woman,  he continued,  but a little of her goes a long way. I
couldn t live near her if you paid me. 

Margaret smiled. Though presenting a firm front to outsiders, no Wilcox
could live near, or near the possessions of, any other Wilcox. They
had the colonial spirit, and were always making for some spot where the
white man might carry his burden unobserved. Of course, Howards End was
impossible, so long as the younger couple were established in Hilton.
His objections to the house were plain as daylight now.

Crane had had enough tea, and was sent to the garage, where their car
had been trickling muddy water over Charles s. The downpour had
surely penetrated the Six Hills by now, bringing news of our restless
civilisation.  Curious mounds,  said Henry,  but in with you now;
another time.  He had to be up in London by seven--if possible, by
six-thirty. Once more she lost the sense of space; once more trees,
houses, people, animals, hills, merged and heaved into one dirtiness,
and she was at Wickham Place.

Her evening was pleasant. The sense of flux which had haunted her
all the year disappeared for a time. She forgot the luggage and the
motor-cars, and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little.
She recaptured the sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly
beauty, and, starting from Howards End, she attempted to realise
England. She failed--visions do not come when we try, though they may
come through trying. But an unexpected love of the island awoke in her,
connecting on this side with the joys of the flesh, on that with the
inconceivable. Helen and her father had known this love, poor Leonard
Bast was groping after it, but it had been hidden from Margaret till
this afternoon. It had certainly come through the house and old Miss
Avery. Through them: the notion of  through  persisted; her mind
trembled towards a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words.
Then, veering back into warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering
plum-trees, and all the tangible joys of spring.

Henry, after allaying her agitation, had taken her over his property,
and had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms. He
had sketched the history of the little estate.  It is so unlucky,  ran
the monologue,  that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago.
Then it had four--five--times the land--thirty acres at least. One
could have made something out of it then--a small park, or at all events
shrubberies, and rebuilt the house farther away from the road. What s
the good of taking it in hand now? Nothing but the meadow left, and even
that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things--yes, and
the house too. Oh, it was no joke.  She saw two women as he spoke, one
old, the other young, watching their inheritance melt away. She saw them
greet him as a deliverer.  Mismanagement did it--besides, the days for
small farms are over. It doesn t pay--except with intensive cultivation.
Small holdings, back to the land--ah! philanthropic bunkum. Take it as a
rule that nothing pays on a small scale. Most of the land you see (they
were standing at an upper window, the only one which faced west) belongs
to the people at the Park--they made their pile over copper--good chaps.
Avery s Farm, Sishe s--what they call the Common, where you see that
ruined oak--one after the other fell in, and so did this, as near as
is no matter.  But Henry had saved it as near as is no matter without fine feelings or deep insight, but he had saved it, and she loved him for the deed.  When I had more control I did what I could--sold off the two and a half
animals, and the mangy pony, and the superannuated tools; pulled down
the outhouses; drained; thinned out I don t know how many guelder-roses
and elder-trees; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a
hall, and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was. Garage and so on
came later. But one could still tell it s been an old farm. And yet
it isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew.  No, it
wasn t; and if he did not quite understand it, the artistic crew would
still less; it was English, and the wych-elm that she saw from the
window was an English tree. No report had prepared her for its peculiar
glory. It was neither warrior, nor lover, nor god; in none of these
roles do the English excel. It was a comrade bending over the house,
strength and adventure in its roots, but in its utmost fingers
tenderness, and the girth, that a dozen men could not have spanned,
became in the end evanescent, till pale bud clusters seemed to float
in the air. It was a comrade. House and tree transcended any similes of
sex. Margaret thought of them now, and was to think of them through many
a windy night and London day, but to compare either to man, to woman,
always dwarfed the vision. Yet they kept within limits of the human.
Their message was not of eternity, but of hope on this side of the
grave. As she stood in the one, gazing at the other, truer relationship
had gleamed.

Another touch, and the account of her day is finished. They entered the
garden for a minute, and to Mr. Wilcox s surprise she was right. Teeth,
pigs  teeth, could be seen in the bark of the wych-elm tree--just the
white tips of them showing.  Extraordinary!  he cried.  Who told you? 

 I heard of it one winter in London,  was her answer, for she, too,
avoided mentioning Mrs. Wilcox by name.

Evie heard of her father s engagement when she was in for a tennis
tournament, and her play went simply to pot. That she should marry and
leave him had seemed natural enough; that he, left alone, should do the
same was deceitful; and now Charles and Dolly said that it was all her
fault.  But I never dreamt of such a thing,  she grumbled.  Dad took
me to call now and then, and made me ask her to Simpson s. Well, I m
altogether off dad.  It was also an insult to their mother s memory;
there they were agreed, and Evie had the idea of returning Mrs. Wilcox s
lace and jewellery  as a protest.  Against what it would protest she was
not clear; but being only eighteen, the idea of renunciation appealed
to her, the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace. Dolly then
suggested that she and Uncle Percy should pretend to break off their
engagement, and then perhaps Mr. Wilcox would quarrel with Miss
Schlegel, and break off his; or Paul might be cabled for. But at this
point Charles told them not to talk nonsense. So Evie settled to marry
as soon as possible; it was no good hanging about with these Schlegels
eyeing her. The date of her wedding was consequently put forward from
September to August, and in the intoxication of presents she recovered
much of her good-humour.

Margaret found that she was expected to figure at this function, and to
figure largely; it would be such an opportunity, said Henry, for her
to get to know his set. Sir James Bidder would be there, and all the
Cahills and the Fussells, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Warrington Wilcox,
had fortunately got back from her tour round the world. Henry she loved,
but his set promised to be another matter. He had not the knack of
surrounding himself with nice people--indeed, for a man of ability and
virtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate; he had no guiding
principle beyond a certain preference for mediocrity; he was content to
settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard, and so, while his
investments went right, his friends generally went wrong. She would be
told,  Oh, So-and-so s a good sort--a thundering good sort,  and find,
on meeting him, that he was a brute or a bore. If Henry had shown real
affection, she would have understood, for affection explains everything.
But he seemed without sentiment. The  thundering good sort  might at
any moment become  a fellow for whom I never did have much use, and have
less now,  and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion. Margaret had done
the same as a schoolgirl. Now she never forgot any one for whom she had
once cared; she connected, though the connection might be bitter, and
she hoped that some day Henry would do the same.

Evie was not to be married from Ducie Street. She had a fancy for
something rural, and, besides, no one would be in London then, so she
left her boxes for a few weeks at Oniton Grange, and her banns were
duly published in the parish church, and for a couple of days the little
town, dreaming between the ruddy hills, was roused by the clang of our
civilisation, and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass. Oniton
had been a discovery of Mr. Wilcox s--a discovery of which he was not
altogether proud. It was up towards the Welsh border, and so difficult
of access that he had concluded it must be something special. A ruined
castle stood in the grounds. But having got there, what was one to do?
The shooting was bad, the fishing indifferent, and womenfolk reported
the scenery as nothing much. The place turned out to be in the wrong
part of Shropshire, and though he never ran down his own property to
others, he was only waiting to get it off his hands, and then to let
fly. Evie s marriage was its last appearance in public. As soon as a
tenant was found, it became a house for which he never had had much use,
and had less now, and, like Howards End, faded into Limbo.

But on Margaret Oniton was destined to make a lasting impression. She
regarded it as her future home, and was anxious to start straight with
the clergy, etc., and, if possible, to see something of the local life.
It was a market-town--as tiny a one as England possesses--and had for
ages served that lonely valley, and guarded our marches against the
Celt. In spite of the occasion, in spite of the numbing hilarity that
greeted her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at Paddington,
her senses were awake and watching, and though Oniton was to prove one
of her innumerable false starts, she never forgot it, or the things that
happened there.

The London party only numbered eight--the Fussells, father and son,
two Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs. Plynlimmon and Lady Edser, Mrs.
Warrington Wilcox and her daughter, and, lastly, the little girl,
very smart and quiet, who figures at so many weddings, and who kept a
watchful eye on Margaret, the bride-elect. Dolly was absent--a domestic
event detained her at Hilton; Paul had cabled a humorous message;
Charles was to meet them with a trio of motors at Shrewsbury; Helen had
refused her invitation; Tibby had never answered his. The management was
excellent, as was to be expected with anything that Henry undertook; one
was conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the background. They
were his guests as soon as they reached the train; a special label
for their luggage; a courier; a special lunch; they had only to look
pleasant and, where possible, pretty. Margaret thought with dismay
of her own nuptials--presumably under the management of Tibby.  Mr.
Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the pleasure of Mrs.
Plynlimmon s company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister
Margaret.  The formula was incredible, but it must soon be printed and
sent, and though Wickham Place need not compete with Oniton, it must
feed its guests properly, and provide them with sufficient chairs. Her
wedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeois--she hoped the latter.
Such an affair as the present, staged with a deftness that was almost
beautiful, lay beyond her powers and those of her friends.

The low rich purr of a Great Western express is not the worst background
for conversation, and the journey passed pleasantly enough. Nothing
could have exceeded the kindness of the two men. They raised windows
for some ladies, and lowered them for others, they rang the bell for the
servant, they identified the colleges as the train slipped past Oxford,
they caught books or bag-purses in the act of tumbling on to the floor.
Yet there was nothing finicking about their politeness--it had the
public-school touch, and, though sedulous, was virile. More battles than
Waterloo have been won on our playing-fields, and Margaret bowed to a
charm of which she did not wholly approve, and said nothing when the
Oxford colleges were identified wrongly.  Male and female created He
them ; the journey to Shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement,
and the long glass saloon, that moved so easily and felt so comfortable,
became a forcing-house for the idea of sex.

At Shrewsbury came fresh air. Margaret was all for sight-seeing, and
while the others were finishing their tea at the Raven, she annexed a
motor and hurried over the astonishing city. Her chauffeur was not
the faithful Crane, but an Italian, who dearly loved making her late.
Charles, watch in hand, though with a level brow, was standing in front
of the hotel when they returned. It was perfectly all right, he
told her; she was by no means the last. And then he dived into the
coffee-room, and she heard him say,  For God s sake, hurry the women up;
we shall never be off,  and Albert Fussell reply,  Not I; I ve done
my share,  and Colonel Fussell opine that the ladies were getting
themselves up to kill. Presently Myra (Mrs. Warrington s daughter)
appeared, and as she was his cousin, Charles blew her up a little; she
had been changing her smart travelling hat for a smart motor hat. Then
Mrs. Warrington herself, leading the quiet child; the two Anglo-Indian
ladies were always last. Maids, courier, heavy luggage, had already
gone on by a branch-line to a station nearer Oniton, but there were five
hat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be packed, and five dust-cloaks
to be put on, and to be put off at the last moment, because Charles
declared them not necessary. The men presided over everything with
unfailing good-humour. By half-past five the party was ready, and went
out of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge.

Shropshire had not the reticence of Hertfordshire. Though robbed of half
its magic by swift movement, it still conveyed the sense of hills. They
were nearing the buttresses that force the Severn eastward and make it
an English stream, and the sun, sinking over the Sentinels of Wales,
was straight in their eyes. Having picked up another guest, they
turned southward, avoiding the greater mountains, but conscious of an
occasional summit, rounded and mild, whose colouring differed in quality
from that of the lower earth, and whose contours altered more slowly.
Quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons: the
West, as ever, was retreating with some secret which may not be worth
the discovery, but which no practical man will ever discover.

They spoke of Tariff Reform.

Mrs. Warrington was just back from the Colonies. Like many other critics
of Empire, her mouth had been stopped with food, and she could only
exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received, and warn
the Mother Country against trifling with young Titans.  They threaten to
cut the painter,  she cried,  and where shall we be then? Miss Schlegel,
you ll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff Reform? It is our last
hope. 

Margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side, and they began
to quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them
deep into the hills. Curious these were rather than impressive, for
their outlines lacked beauty, and the pink fields on their summits
suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry. An occasional
outcrop of rock, an occasional wood, an occasional  forest,  treeless
and brown, all hinted at wildness to follow, but the main colour was an
agricultural green. The air grew cooler; they had surmounted the last
gradient, and Oniton lay below them with its church, its radiating
houses, its castle, its river-girt peninsula. Close to the castle was
a grey mansion unintellectual but kindly, stretching with its grounds
across the peninsula s neck--the sort of mansion that was built all over
England in the beginning of the last century, while architecture was
still an expression of the national character. That was the Grange,
remarked Albert, over his shoulder, and then he jammed the brake on, and
the motor slowed down and stopped.  I m sorry,  said he, turning round.
 Do you mind getting out--by the door on the right. Steady on. 

 What s happened?  asked Mrs. Warrington.

Then the car behind them drew up, and the voice of Charles was heard
saying:  Get the women out at once.  There was a concourse of males,
and Margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the
second car. What had happened? As it started off again, the door of a
cottage opened, and a girl screamed wildly at them.

 What is it?  the ladies cried.

Charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking. Then he said:  It s
all right. Your car just touched a dog. 

 But stop!  cried Margaret, horrified.

 It didn t hurt him. 

 Didn t really hurt him?  asked Myra.

 No. 

 Do PLEASE stop!  said Margaret, leaning forward. She was standing up in
the car, the other occupants holding her knees to steady her.  I want to
go back, please. 

Charles took no notice.

 We ve left Mr. Fussell behind,  said another;  and Angelo, and Crane. 

 Yes, but no woman. 

 I expect a little of --Mrs. Warrington scratched her palm-- will be
more to the point than one of us! 

 The insurance company see to that,  remarked Charles,  and Albert will
do the talking. 

 I want to go back, though, I say!  repeated Margaret, getting angry.

Charles took no notice. The motor, loaded with refugees, continued to
travel very slowly down the hill.  The men are there,  chorused the
others.  They will see to it. 

 The men CAN T see to it. Oh, this is ridiculous! Charles, I ask you to
stop. 

 Stopping s no good,  drawled Charles.

 Isn t it?  said Margaret, and jumped straight out of the car. She fell
on her knees, cut her gloves, shook her hat over her ear. Cries of alarm
followed her.  You ve hurt yourself,  exclaimed Charles, jumping after
her.

 Of course I ve hurt myself!  she retorted.

 May I ask what-- 

 There s nothing to ask,  said Margaret.

 Your hand s bleeding. 

 I know. 

 I m in for a frightful row from the pater. 

 You should have thought of that sooner, Charles. 

Charles had never been in such a position before. It was a woman in
revolt who was hobbling away from him--and the sight was too strange to
leave any room for anger. He recovered himself when the others caught
them up: their sort he understood. He commanded them to go back.

Albert Fussell was seen walking towards them.

 It s all right!  he called.  It was a cat. 

 There!  exclaimed Charles triumphantly.  It s only a rotten cat. 

 Got room in your car for a little un? I cut as soon as I saw it wasn t
a dog; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl.  But Margaret walked
forward steadily. Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl? Ladies
sheltering behind men, men sheltering behind servants--the whole
system s wrong, and she must challenge it.

 Miss Schlegel!  Pon my word, you ve hurt your hand. 

 I m just going to see,  said Margaret.  Don t you wait, Mr. Fussell. 

The second motor came round the corner.  It is all right, madam,  said
Crane in his turn. He had taken to calling her madam.

 What s all right? The cat? 

 Yes, madam. The girl will receive compensation for it. 

 She was a very ruda girla,  said Angelo from the third motor
thoughtfully.

 Wouldn t you have been rude? 

The Italian spread out his hands, implying that he had not thought of
rudeness, but would produce it if it pleased her. The situation became
absurd. The gentlemen were again buzzing round Miss Schlegel with offers
of assistance, and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand. She yielded,
apologising slightly, and was led back to the car, and soon the
landscape resumed its motion, the lonely cottage disappeared, the castle
swelled on its cushion of turf, and they had arrived. No doubt she had
disgraced herself. But she felt their whole journey from London had
been unreal. They had no part with the earth and its emotions. They were
dust, and a stink, and cosmopolitan chatter, and the girl whose cat had
been killed had lived more deeply than they.

 Oh, Henry,  she exclaimed,  I have been so naughty,  for she had
decided to take up this line.  We ran over a cat. Charles told me not to
jump out, but I would, and look!  She held out her bandaged hand.  Your
poor Meg went such a flop. 

Mr. Wilcox looked bewildered. In evening dress, he was standing to
welcome his guests in the hall.

 Thinking it was a dog,  added Mrs. Warrington.

 Ah, a dog s a companion!  said Colonel Fussell.  A dog ll remember you. 

 Have you hurt yourself, Margaret? 

 Not to speak about; and it s my left hand. 

 Well, hurry up and change. 

She obeyed, as did the others. Mr. Wilcox then turned to his son.

 Now, Charles, what s happened? 

Charles was absolutely honest. He described what he believed to have
happened. Albert had flattened out a cat, and Miss Schlegel had lost her
nerve, as any woman might. She had been got safely into the other car,
but when it was in motion had leapt out again, in spite of all that they
could say. After walking a little on the road, she had calmed down and
had said that she was sorry. His father accepted this explanation, and
neither knew that Margaret had artfully prepared the way for it.
It fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature. In the
smoking-room, after dinner, the Colonel put forward the view that Miss
Schlegel had jumped it out of devilry. Well he remembered as a young
man, in the harbour of Gibraltar once, how a girl--a handsome girl,
too--had jumped overboard for a bet. He could see her now, and all the
lads overboard after her. But Charles and Mr. Wilcox agreed it was much
more probably nerves in Miss Schlegel s case. Charles was depressed.
That woman had a tongue. She would bring worse disgrace on his father
before she had done with them. He strolled out on to the castle mound to
think the matter over. The evening was exquisite. On three sides of him
a little river whispered, full of messages from the West; above his head
the ruins made patterns against the sky. He carefully reviewed their
dealings with this family, until he fitted Helen, and Margaret, and Aunt
Juley into an orderly conspiracy. Paternity had made him suspicious.
He had two children to look after, and more coming, and day by day
they seemed less likely to grow up rich men.  It is all very well, 
 he reflected,  the pater s saying that he will be just to all, but one
can t be just indefinitely. Money isn t elastic. What s to happen if
Evie has a family? And, come to that, so may the pater. There ll not be
enough to go round, for there s none coming in, either through Dolly or
Percy. It s damnable!  He looked enviously at the Grange, whose windows
poured light and laughter. First and last, this wedding would cost a
pretty penny. Two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace,
and as the syllables  Imperialism  were wafted to his ears, he guessed
that one of them was his aunt. She might have helped him, if she too had
not had a family to provide for.  Every one for himself,  he repeated--a
maxim which had cheered him in the past, but which rang grimly enough
among the ruins of Oniton. He lacked his father s ability in business,
and so had an ever higher regard for money; unless he could inherit
plenty, he feared to leave his children poor.

As he sat thinking, one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into
the meadow; he recognised her as Margaret by the white bandage that
gleamed on her arm, and put out his cigar, lest the gleam should betray
him. She climbed up the mound in zigzags, and at times stooped down, as
if she was stroking the turf. It sounds absolutely incredible, but for
a moment Charles thought that she was in love with him, and had come out
to tempt him. Charles believed in temptresses, who are indeed the strong
man s necessary complement, and having no sense of humour, he could not
purge himself of the thought by a smile. Margaret, who was engaged to
his father, and his sister s wedding-guest, kept on her way without
noticing him, and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point. But
what was she doing? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and
catching her dress in brambles and burrs? As she edged round the
keep, she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar-smoke, for she
exclaimed,  Hullo! Who s that? 

Charles made no answer.

 Saxon or Celt?  she continued, laughing in the darkness.  But it
doesn t matter. Whichever you are, you will have to listen to me. I love
this place. I love Shropshire. I hate London. I am glad that this will
be my home. Ah, dear --she was now moving back towards the house-- what
a comfort to have arrived! 

 That woman means mischief,  thought Charles, and compressed his lips.
In a few minutes he followed her indoors, as the ground was getting
damp. Mists were rising from the river, and presently it became
invisible, though it whispered more loudly. There had been a heavy
downpour in the Welsh hills.

humour  by half past five the party was ready  and went out of shrewsbury by the welsh bridge   shropshire had not the reticence of hertfordshire  though robbed of half its magic by swift movement  it still conveyed the sense of hills  they were nearing the buttresses that force the severn eastward and make it an english stream  and the sun  sinking over the sentinels of wales  was straight in their eyes  having picked up another guest  they turned southward  avoiding the greater mountains  but conscious of an occasional summit  rounded and mild  whose colouring differed in quality from that of the lower earth  and whose contours altered more slowly  quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons  the west  as ever  was retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery  but which no practical man will ever discover   they spoke of tariff reform   mrs  warrington was just back from the colonies  like many other critics of empire  her mouth had been stopped with food  and she could only exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received  and warn the mother country against trifling with young titans   they threaten to cut the painter   she cried   and where shall we be then  miss schlegel  you ll undertake to keep henry sound about tariff reform  it is our last hope    margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side  and they began to quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them deep into the hills  curious these were rather than impressive  for their outlines lacked beauty  and the pink fields on their summits suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry  an occasional outcrop of rock  an occasional wood  an occasional  forest   treeless and brown  all hinted at wildness to follow  but the main colour was an agricultural green  the air grew cooler  they had surmounted the last gradient  and oniton lay below them with its church  its radiating houses  its castle  its river girt peninsula  close to the castle was a grey mansion unintellectual but kindly  stretching with its grounds across the peninsula s neck  the sort of mansion that was built all over england in the beginning of the last century  while architecture was still an expression of the national character  that was the grange  remarked albert  over his shoulder  and then he jammed the brake on  and the motor slowed down and stopped   i m sorry   said he  turning round   do you mind getting out  by the door on the right  steady on     what s happened   asked mrs  warrington   then the car behind them drew up  and the voice of charles was heard saying   get the women out at once   there was a concourse of males  and margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the second car  what had happened  as it started off again  the door of a cottage opened  and a girl screamed wildly at them    what is it   the ladies cried   charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking  then he said   it s all right  your car just touched a dog     but stop   cried margaret  horrified    it didn t hurt him     didn t really hurt him   asked myra    no     do please stop   said margaret  leaning forward  she was standing up in the car  the other occupants holding her knees to steady her   i want to go back  please    charles took no notice    we ve left mr  fussell behind   said another   and angelo  and crane     yes  but no woman     i expect a little of   mrs  warrington scratched her palm   will be more to the point than one of us     the insurance company see to that   remarked charles   and albert will do the talking     i want to go back  though  i say   repeated margaret  getting angry   charles took no notice  the motor  loaded with refugees  continued to travel very slowly down the hill   the men are there   chorused the others   they will see to it     the men can t see to it  oh  this is ridiculous  charles  i ask you to stop     stopping s no good   drawled charles    isn t it   said margaret  and jumped straight out of the car  she fell on her knees  cut her gloves  shook her hat over her ear  cries of alarm followed her   you ve hurt yourself   exclaimed charles  jumping after her    of course i ve hurt myself   she retorted    may i ask what      there s nothing to ask   said margaret    your hand s bleeding     i know     i m in for a frightful row from the pater     you should have thought of that sooner  charles    charles had never been in such a position before  it was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him  and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger  he recovered himself when the others caught them up  their sort he understood  he commanded them to go back   albert fussell was seen walking towards them    it s all right   he called   it was a cat     there   exclaimed charles triumphantly   it s only a rotten cat     got room in your car for a little un  i cut as soon as i saw it wasn t a dog  the chauffeurs are tackling the girl   but margaret walked forward steadily  why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl  ladies sheltering behind men  men sheltering behind servants  the whole system s wrong  and she must challenge it    miss schlegel   pon my word  you ve hurt your hand     i m just going to see   said margaret   don t you wait  mr  fussell    the second motor came round the corner   it is all right  madam   said crane in his turn  he had taken to calling her madam    what s all right  the cat     yes  madam  the girl will receive compensation for it     she was a very ruda girla   said angelo from the third motor thoughtfully    wouldn t you have been rude    the italian spread out his hands  implying that he had not thought of rudeness  but would produce it if it pleased her  the situation became absurd  the gentlemen were again buzzing round miss schlegel with offers of assistance  and lady edser began to bind up her hand  she yielded  apologising slightly  and was led back to the car  and soon the landscape resumed its motion  the lonely cottage disappeared  the castle swelled on its cushion of turf  and they had arrived  no doubt she had disgraced herself  but she felt their whole journey from london had been unreal  they had no part with the earth and its emotions  they were dust  and a stink  and cosmopolitan chatter  and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they    oh  henry   she exclaimed   i have been so naughty   for she had decided to take up this line   we ran over a cat  charles told me not to jump out  but i would  and look   she held out her bandaged hand   your poor meg went such a flop    mr  wilcox looked bewildered  in evening dress  he was standing to welcome his guests in the hall    thinking it was a dog   added mrs  warrington    ah  a dog s a companion   said colonel fussell   a dog ll remember you     have you hurt yourself  margaret     not to speak about  and it s my left hand     well  hurry up and change    she obeyed  as did the others  mr  wilcox then turned to his son    now  charles  what s happened    charles was absolutely honest  he described what he believed to have happened  albert had flattened out a cat  and miss schlegel had lost her nerve  as any woman might  she had been got safely into the other car  but when it was in motion had leapt out again  in spite of all that they could say  after walking a little on the road  she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry  his father accepted this explanation  and neither knew that margaret had artfully prepared the way for it  it fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature  in the smoking room  after dinner  the colonel put forward the view that miss schlegel had jumped it out of devilry  well he remembered as a young man  in the harbour of gibraltar once  how a girl  a handsome girl  too  had jumped overboard for a bet  he could see her now  and all the lads overboard after her  but charles and mr  wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in miss schlegel s case  charles was depressed  that woman had a tongue  she would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them  he strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over  the evening was exquisite  on three sides of him a little river whispered  full of messages from the west  above his head the ruins made patterns against the sky  he carefully reviewed their dealings with this family  until he fitted helen  and margaret  and aunt juley into an orderly conspiracy  paternity had made him suspicious  he had two children to look after  and more coming  and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men   it is all very well    he reflected   the pater s saying that he will be just to all  but one can t be just indefinitely  money isn t elastic  what s to happen if evie has a family  and  come to that  so may the pater  there ll not be enough to go round  for there s none coming in  either through dolly or percy  it s damnable   he looked enviously at the grange  whose windows poured light and laughter  first and last  this wedding would cost a pretty penny  two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace  and as the syllables  imperialism  were wafted to his ears  he guessed that one of them was his aunt  she might have helped him  if she too had not had a family to provide for   every one for himself   he repeated  a maxim which had cheered him in the past  but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of oniton  he lacked his father s ability in business  and so had an ever higher regard for money  unless he could inherit plenty  he feared to leave his children poor   as he sat thinking  one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow  he recognised her as margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm  and put out his cigar  lest the gleam should betray him  she climbed up the mound in zigzags  and at times stooped down  as if she was stroking the turf  it sounds absolutely incredible  but for a moment charles thought that she was in love with him  and had come out to tempt him  charles believed in temptresses  who are indeed the strong man s necessary complement  and having no sense of humour  he could not purge himself of the thought by a smile  margaret  who was engaged to his father  and his sister s wedding guest  kept on her way without noticing him  and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point  but what was she doing  why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs  as she edged round the keep  she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar smoke  for she exclaimed   hullo  who s that    charles made no answer    saxon or celt   she continued  laughing in the darkness   but it doesn t matter  whichever you are  you will have to listen to me  i love this place  i love shropshire  i hate london  i am glad that this will be my home  ah  dear   she was now moving back towards the house   what a comfort to have arrived     that woman means mischief   thought charles  and compressed his lips  in a few minutes he followed her indoors  as the ground was getting damp  mists were rising from the river  and presently it became invisible  though it whispered more loudly  there had been a heavy downpour in the welsh

Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula. The weather promised
well, and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that
Margaret watched it. Presently she saw the keep, and the sun painted
the rubble gold, and charged the white sky with blue. The shadow of the
house gathered itself together, and fell over the garden. A cat looked
up at her window and mewed. Lastly the river appeared, still holding the
mists between its banks and its overhanging alders, and only visible as
far as a hill, which cut off its upper reaches.

Margaret was fascinated by Oniton. She had said that she loved it, but
it was rather its romantic tension that held her. The rounded Druids of
whom she had caught glimpses in her drive, the rivers hurrying down
from them to England, the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills,
thrilled her with poetry. The house was insignificant, but the prospect
from it would be an eternal joy, and she thought of all the friends she
would have to stop in it, and of the conversion of Henry himself to a
rural life. Society, too, promised favourably. The rector of the parish
had dined with them last night, and she found that he was a friend of
her father s, and so knew what to find in her. She liked him. He would
introduce her to the town. While, on her other side, Sir James Bidder
sat, repeating that she only had to give the word, and he would whip up
the county families for twenty miles round. Whether Sir James, who was
Garden Seeds, had promised what he could perform, she doubted, but so
long as Henry mistook them for the county families when they did call,
she was content.

Charles Wilcox and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn. They were going
for a morning dip, and a servant followed them with their bathing-suits.
She had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast, but saw that
the day was still sacred to men, and amused herself by watching their
contretemps. In the first place the key of the bathing-shed could not be
found. Charles stood by the riverside with folded hands, tragical, while
the servant shouted, and was misunderstood by another servant in the
garden. Then came a difficulty about a springboard, and soon three
people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders
and counter orders and recriminations and apologies. If Margaret wanted
to jump from a motor-car, she jumped; if Tibby thought paddling would
benefit his ankles, he paddled; if a clerk desired adventure, he took
a walk in the dark. But these athletes seemed paralysed. They could not
bathe without their appliances, though the morning sun was calling and
the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream. Had they found
the life of the body after all? Could not the men whom they despised as
milksops beat them, even on their own ground?

She thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day--no
worrying of servants, no appliances, beyond good sense. Her reflections
were disturbed by the quiet child, who had come out to speak to the
cat, but was now watching her watch the men. She called,  Good-morning,
dear,  a little sharply. Her voice spread consternation. Charles looked
round, and though completely attired in indigo blue, vanished into the
shed, and was seen no more.

 Miss Wilcox is up--  the child whispered, and then became
unintelligible.

 What is that?  it sounded like,  --cut-yoke--sack-back-- 

 I can t hear. 

 --On the bed--tissue-paper-- 

Gathering that the wedding-dress was on view, and that a visit would
be seemly, she went to Evie s room. All was hilarity here. Evie, in a
petticoat, was dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies, while the
other was adoring yards of white satin. They screamed, they laughed,
they sang, and the dog barked.

Margaret screamed a little too, but without conviction. She could not
feel that a wedding was so funny. Perhaps something was missing in her
equipment.

Evie gasped:  Dolly is a rotter not to be here! Oh, we would rag just
then!  Then Margaret went down to breakfast.

Henry was already installed; he ate slowly and spoke little, and was,
in Margaret s eyes, the only member of their party who dodged emotion
successfully. She could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss
of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife. Yet he dwelt
intact, only issuing orders occasionally--orders that promoted the
comfort of his guests. He inquired after her hand; he set her to pour
out the coffee and Mrs. Warrington to pour out the tea. When Evie came
down there was a moment s awkwardness, and both ladies rose to vacate
their places.  Burton,  called Henry,  serve tea and coffee from the
sideboard!  It wasn t genuine tact, but it was tact, of a sort--the
sort that is as useful as the genuine, and saves even more situations at
Board meetings. Henry treated a marriage like a funeral, item by item,
never raising his eyes to the whole, and  Death, where is thy sting?
Love, where is thy victory?  one would exclaim at the close.

After breakfast Margaret claimed a few words with him. It was always
best to approach him formally. She asked for the interview, because he
was going on to shoot grouse to-morrow, and she was returning to Helen
in town.

 Certainly, dear,  said he.  Of course, I have the time. What do you
want? 

 Nothing. 

 I was afraid something had gone wrong. 

 No; I have nothing to say, but you may talk. 

Glancing at his watch, he talked of the nasty curve at the lych-gate.
She heard him with interest. Her surface could always respond to his
without contempt, though all her deeper being might be yearning to help
him. She had abandoned any plan of action. Love is the best, and the
more she let herself love him, the more chance was there that he would
set his soul in order. Such a moment as this, when they sat under fair
weather by the walks of their future home, was so sweet to her that
its sweetness would surely pierce to him. Each lift of his eyes, each
parting of the thatched lip from the clean-shaven, must prelude
the tenderness that kills the Monk and the Beast at a single blow.
Disappointed a hundred times, she still hoped. She loved him with too
clear a vision to fear his cloudiness. Whether he droned trivialities,
as to-day, or sprang kisses on her in the twilight, she could pardon
him, she could respond.

 If there is this nasty curve,  she suggested,  couldn t we walk to the
church? Not, of course, you and Evie; but the rest of us might very well
go on first, and that would mean fewer carriages. 

 One can t have ladies walking through the Market Square. The Fussells
wouldn t like it; they were awfully particular at Charles s wedding.
My--she--our party was anxious to walk, and certainly the church was
just round the corner, and I shouldn t have minded; but the Colonel made
a great point of it. 

 You men shouldn t be so chivalrous,  said Margaret thoughtfully.

 Why not? 

She knew why not, but said that she did not know. He then announced
that, unless she had anything special to say, he must visit the
wine-cellar, and they went off together in search of Burton. Though
clumsy and a little inconvenient, Oniton was a genuine country-house.
They clattered down flagged passages, looking into room after room,
and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties. The
wedding-breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church,
and tea would be served in the garden. The sight of so many agitated
and serious people made Margaret smile, but she reflected that they
were paid to be serious, and enjoyed being agitated. Here were the lower
wheels of the machine that was tossing Evie up into nuptial glory. A
little boy blocked their way with pig-pails. His mind could not grasp
their greatness, and he said:  By your leave; let me pass, please. 
 Henry asked him where Burton was. But the servants were so new that they
did not know one another s names. In the still-room sat the band, who
had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee, and who were already
drinking beer. Scents of Araby came from the kitchen, mingled with
cries. Margaret knew what had happened there, for it happened at Wickham
Place. One of the wedding dishes had boiled over, and the cook was
throwing cedar-shavings to hide the smell. At last they came upon
the butler. Henry gave him the keys, and handed Margaret down the
cellar-stairs. Two doors were unlocked. She, who kept all her wine at
the bottom of the linen-cupboard, was astonished at the sight.  We shall
never get through it!  she cried, and the two men were suddenly drawn
into brotherhood, and exchanged smiles. She felt as if she had again
jumped out of the car while it was moving.

Certainly Oniton would take some digesting. It would be no small
business to remain herself, and yet to assimilate such an establishment.
She must remain herself, for his sake as well as her own, since a
shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies; and she must
assimilate for reasons of common honesty, since she had no right to
marry a man and make him uncomfortable. Her only ally was the power of
Home. The loss of Wickham Place had taught her more than its possession.
Howards End had repeated the lesson. She was determined to create new
sanctities among these hills.

After visiting the wine-cellar, she dressed, and then came the wedding,
which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it.
Everything went like one o clock. Mr. Cahill materialised out of space,
and was waiting for his bride at the church door. No one dropped the
ring or mispronounced the responses, or trod on Evie s train, or cried.
In a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty, the register was
signed, and they were back in their carriages, negotiating the dangerous
curve by the lych-gate. Margaret was convinced that they had not been
married at all, and that the Norman church had been intent all the time
on other business.

There were more documents to sign at the house, and the breakfast to
eat, and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party. There
had been a great many refusals, and after all it was not a very big
affair--not as big as Margaret s would be. She noted the dishes and
the strips of red carpet, that outwardly she might give Henry what was
proper. But inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of
Sunday church and fox-hunting. If only some one had been upset! But this
wedding had gone off so particularly well-- quite like a durbar  in the
opinion of Lady Edser, and she thoroughly agreed with her.

So the wasted day lumbered forward, the bride and bridegroom drove off,
yelling with laughter, and for the second time the sun retreated towards
the hills of Wales. Henry, who was more tired than he owned, came up to
her in the castle meadow, and, in tones of unusual softness, said that
he was pleased. Everything had gone off so well. She felt that he was
praising her, too, and blushed; certainly she had done all she could
with his intractable friends, and had made a special point of kotowing
to the men. They were breaking camp this evening; only the Warringtons
and quiet child would stay the night, and the others were already moving
towards the house to finish their packing.  I think it did go off
well,  she agreed.  Since I had to jump out of the motor, I m thankful I
lighted on my left hand. I am so very glad about it, Henry dear; I only
hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable. You must all
remember that we have no practical person among us, except my aunt, and
she is not used to entertainments on a large scale. 

 I know,  he said gravely.  Under the circumstances, it would be better
to put everything into the hands of Harrods or Whiteley s, or even to go
to some hotel. 

 You desire a hotel? 

 Yes, because--well, I mustn t interfere with you. No doubt you want to
be married from your old home. 

 My old home s falling into pieces, Henry. I only want my new. Isn t it
a perfect evening-- 

 The Alexandrina isn t bad-- 

 The Alexandrina,  she echoed, more occupied with the threads of smoke
that were issuing from their chimneys, and ruling the sunlit slopes with
parallels of grey.

 It s off Curzon Street. 

 Is it? Let s be married from off Curzon Street. 

Then she turned westward, to gaze at the swirling gold. Just where the
river rounded the hill the sun caught it. Fairyland must lie above the
bend, and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past Charles s
bathing-shed. She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled, and when
they moved back to the house, she could not recognise the faces of
people who were coming out of it. A parlour-maid was preceding them.

 Who are those people?  she asked.

 They re callers!  exclaimed Henry.  It s too late for callers. 

 Perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents. 

 I m not at home yet to townees. 

 Well, hide among the ruins, and if I can stop them, I will. 

He thanked her.

Margaret went forward, smiling socially. She supposed that these were
unpunctual guests, who would have to be content with vicarious civility,
since Evie and Charles were gone, Henry tired, and the others in their
rooms. She assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long. For one of the
group was Helen--Helen in her oldest clothes, and dominated by that
tense, wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery
days.

 What is it?  she called.  Oh, what s wrong? Is Tibby ill? 

Helen spoke to her two companions, who fell back. Then she bore forward
furiously.

 They re starving!  she shouted.  I found them starving! 

 Who? Why have you come? 

 The Basts. 

 Oh, Helen!  moaned Margaret.  Whatever have you done now? 

 He has lost his place. He has been turned out of his bank. Yes, he s
done for. We upper classes have ruined him, and I suppose you ll tell
me it s the battle of life. Starving. His wife is ill. Starving. She
fainted in the train. 

 Helen, are you mad? 

 Perhaps. Yes. If you like, I m mad. But I ve brought them. I ll stand
injustice no longer. I ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this
luxury, this talk of impersonal forces, this cant about God doing what
we re too slack to do ourselves. 

 Have you actually brought two starving people from London to
Shropshire, Helen? 

Helen was checked. She had not thought of this, and her hysteria abated.
 There was a restaurant car on the train,  she said.

 Don t be absurd. They aren t starving, and you know it. Now, begin from
the beginning. I won t have such theatrical nonsense. How dare you! Yes,
how dare you!  she repeated, as anger filled her,  bursting in to Evie s
wedding in this heartless way. My goodness! but you ve a perverted
notion of philanthropy. Look --she indicated the house-- servants,
people out of the windows. They think it s some vulgar scandal, and
I must explain,  Oh no, it s only my sister screaming, and only two
hangers-on of ours, whom she has brought here for no conceivable
reason.  

 Kindly take back that word  hangers-on,   said Helen, ominously calm.

 Very well,  conceded Margaret, who for all her wrath was determined to
avoid a real quarrel.  I, too, am sorry about them, but it beats me why
you ve brought them here, or why you re here yourself. 

 It s our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox. 

Margaret moved towards the house at this. She was determined not to
worry Henry.

 He s going to Scotland. I know he is. I insist on seeing him. 

 Yes, to-morrow. 

 I knew it was our last chance. 

 How do you do, Mr. Bast?  said Margaret, trying to control her voice.
 This is an odd business. What view do you take of it? 

 There is Mrs. Bast, too,  prompted Helen.

Jacky also shook hands. She, like her husband, was shy, and,
furthermore, ill, and furthermore, so bestially stupid that she could
not grasp what was happening. She only knew that the lady had swept down
like a whirlwind last night, had paid the rent, redeemed the furniture,
provided them with a dinner and a breakfast, and ordered them to meet
her at Paddington next morning. Leonard had feebly protested, and when
the morning came, had suggested that they shouldn t go. But she, half
mesmerised, had obeyed. The lady had told them to, and they must, and
their bed-sitting-room had accordingly changed into Paddington, and
Paddington into a railway carriage, that shook, and grew hot, and grew
cold, and vanished entirely, and reappeared amid torrents of expensive
scent.  You have fainted,  said the lady in an awe-struck voice.
 Perhaps the air will do you good.  And perhaps it had, for here she
was, feeling rather better among a lot of flowers.

 I m sure I don t want to intrude,  began Leonard, in answer to
Margaret s question.  But you have been so kind to me in the past
in warning me about the Porphyrion that I wondered--why, I wondered
whether-- 

 Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again,  supplied
Helen.  Meg, this has been a cheerful business. A bright evening s work
that was on Chelsea Embankment. 

Margaret shook her head and returned to Mr. Bast.

 I don t understand. You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was
a bad concern, didn t you? 

 That s right. 

 And went into a bank instead? 

 I told you all that,  said Helen;  and they reduced their staff after
he had been in a month, and now he s penniless, and I consider that we
and our informant are directly to blame. 

 I hate all this,  Leonard muttered.

 I hope you do, Mr. Bast. But it s no good mincing matters. You have
done yourself no good by coming here. If you intend to confront Mr.
Wilcox, and to call him to account for a chance remark, you will make a
very great mistake. 

 I brought them. I did it all,  cried Helen.

 I can only advise you to go at once. My sister has put you in a false
position, and it is kindest to tell you so. It s too late to get to
town, but you ll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton, where Mrs. Bast can
rest, and I hope you ll be my guests there. 

 That isn t what I want, Miss Schlegel,  said Leonard.  You re very
kind, and no doubt it s a false position, but you make me miserable. I
seem no good at all. 

 It s work he wants,  interpreted Helen.  Can t you see? 

Then he said:  Jacky, let s go. We re more bother than we re worth.
We re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us,
and they never will. There s nothing we re good enough to do. 

 We would like to find you work,  said Margaret rather conventionally.
 We want to--I, like my sister. You re only down in your luck. Go to the
hotel, have a good night s rest, and some day you shall pay me back the
bill, if you prefer it. 

But Leonard was near the abyss, and at such moments men see clearly.
 You don t know what you re talking about,  he said.  I shall never get
work now. If rich people fail at one profession, they can try another.
Not I. I had my groove, and I ve got out of it. I could do one
particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to
command a salary, but that s all. Poetry s nothing, Miss Schlegel. One s
thoughts about this and that are nothing. Your money, too, is nothing,
if you ll understand me. I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own
particular job, it s all over with him. I have seen it happen to others.
Their friends gave them money for a little, but in the end they fall
over the edge. It s no good. It s the whole world pulling. There always
will be rich and poor. 

He ceased.  Won t you have something to eat?  said Margaret.  I don t
know what to do. It isn t my house, and though Mr. Wilcox would have
been glad to see you at any other time--as I say, I don t know what
to do, but I undertake to do what I can for you. Helen, offer them
something. Do try a sandwich, Mrs. Bast. 

They moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing.
Iced cakes, sandwiches innumerable, coffee, claret-cup, champagne,
remained almost intact; their overfed guests could do no more. Leonard
refused. Jacky thought she could manage a little. Margaret left them
whispering together, and had a few more words with Helen.

She said:  Helen, I like Mr. Bast. I agree that he s worth helping. I
agree that we are directly responsible. 

 No, indirectly. Via Mr. Wilcox. 

 Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude, I ll
do nothing. No doubt you re right logically, and are entitled to say
a great many scathing things about Henry. Only, I won t have it. So
choose. 

Helen looked at the sunset.

 If you promise to take them quietly to the George I will speak to Henry
about them--in my own way, mind; there is to be none of this absurd
screaming about justice. I have no use for justice. If it was only a
question of money, we could do it ourselves. But he wants work, and that
we can t give him, but possibly Henry can. 

 It s his duty to,  grumbled Helen.

 Nor am I concerned with duty. I m concerned with the characters of
various people whom we know, and how, things being as they are, things
may be made a little better. Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours; all
business men do. But I am going to ask him, at the risk of a rebuff,
because I want to make things a little better. 

 Very well. I promise. You take it very calmly. 

 Take them off to the George, then, and I ll try. Poor creatures! but
they look tired.  As they parted, she added:  I haven t nearly done with
you, though, Helen. You have been most self-indulgent. I can t get over
it. You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older. Think it
over and alter yourself, or we shan t have happy lives. 

She rejoined Henry. Fortunately he had been sitting down: these physical
matters were important.  Was it townees?  he asked, greeting her with a
pleasant smile.

 You ll never believe me,  said Margaret, sitting down beside him.  It s
all right now, but it was my sister. 

 Helen here?  he cried, preparing to rise.  But she refused the
invitation. I thought hated weddings. 

 Don t get up. She has not come to the wedding. I ve bundled her off to
the George. 

Inherently hospitable, he protested.

 No; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them. 

 Let  em all come. 

 My dear Henry, did you see them? 

 I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman, certainly. 

 The brown bunch was Helen, but did you catch sight of a sea-green and
salmon bunch? 

 What! are they out bean-feasting? 

 No; business. They wanted to see me, and later on I want to talk to you
about them. 

She was ashamed of her own diplomacy. In dealing with a Wilcox, how
tempting it was to lapse from comradeship, and to give him the kind of
woman that he desired! Henry took the hint at once, and said:  Why later
on? Tell me now. No time like the present. 

 Shall I? 

 If it isn t a long story. 

 Oh, not five minutes; but there s a sting at the end of it, for I want
you to find the man some work in your office. 

 What are his qualifications? 

 I don t know. He s a clerk. 

 How old? 

 Twenty-five, perhaps. 

 What s his name? 

 Bast,  said Margaret, and was about to remind him that they had met
at Wickham Place, but stopped herself. It had not been a successful
meeting.

 Where was he before? 

 Dempster s Bank. 

 Why did he leave?  he asked, still remembering nothing.

 They reduced their staff. 

 All right; I ll see him. 

It was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day. Now she
understood why some women prefer influence to rights. Mrs. Plynlimmon,
when condemning suffragettes, had said:  The woman who can t influence
her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself. 
 Margaret had winced, but she was influencing Henry now, and though
pleased at her little victory, she knew that she had won it by the
methods of the harem.

 I should be glad if you took him,  she said,  but I don t know whether
he s qualified. 

 I ll do what I can. But, Margaret, this mustn t be taken as a
precedent. 

 No, of course--of course-- 

 I can t fit in your proteges every day. Business would suffer. 

 I can promise you he s the last. He--he s rather a special case. 

 Proteges always are. 

She let it stand at that. He rose with a little extra touch of
complacency, and held out his hand to help her up. How wide the gulf
between Henry as he was and Henry as Helen thought he ought to be! And
she herself--hovering as usual between the two, now accepting men as
they are, now yearning with her sister for Truth. Love and Truth--their
warfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it,
and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was
reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.

 Your protege has made us late,  said he.  The Fussells--will just be
starting. 

On the whole she sided with men as they are. Henry would save the Basts
as he had saved Howards End, while Helen and her friends were discussing
the ethics of salvation. His was a slap-dash method, but the world has
been built slap-dash, and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset
may be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his
joins. Oniton, like herself, was imperfect. Its apple-trees were
stunted, its castle ruinous. It, too, had suffered in the border warfare
between the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt, between things as they are and
as they ought to be. Once more the west was retreating, once again the
orderly stars were dotting the eastern sky. There is certainly no rest
for us on the earth. But there is happiness, and as Margaret descended
the mound on her lover s arm, she felt that she was having her share.

To her annoyance, Mrs. Bast was still in the garden; the husband and
Helen had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage
rooms. Margaret found this woman repellent. She had felt, when shaking
her hand, an overpowering shame. She remembered the motive of her call
at Wickham Place, and smelt again odours from the abyss--odours the more
disturbing because they were involuntary. For there was no malice in
Jacky. There she sat, a piece of cake in one hand, an empty champagne
glass in the other, doing no harm to anybody.

 She s overtired,  Margaret whispered.

 She s something else,  said Henry.  This won t do. I can t have her in
my garden in this state. 

 Is she--  Margaret hesitated to add  drunk.  Now that she was going
to marry him, he had grown particular. He discountenanced risque
conversations now.

Henry went up to the woman. She raised her face, which gleamed in the
twilight like a puff-ball.

 Madam, you will be more comfortable at the hotel,  he said sharply.

Jacky replied:  If it isn t Hen! 

 Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble,  apologised Margaret.  Il est
tout   fait diff rent. 

 Henry!  she repeated, quite distinctly.

Mr. Wilcox was much annoyed.  I congratulate you on your proteges,  he
remarked.

 Hen, don t go. You do love me, dear, don t you? 

 Bless us, what a person!  sighed Margaret, gathering up her skirts.

Jacky pointed with her cake.  You re a nice boy, you are.  She yawned.
 There now, I love you. 

 Henry, I am awfully sorry. 

 And pray why?  he asked, and looked at her so sternly that she feared
he was ill. He seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded.

 To have brought this down on you. 

 Pray don t apologise. 

The voice continued.

 Why does she call you  Hen ?  said Margaret innocently.  Has she ever
seen you before? 

 Seen Hen before!  said Jacky.  Who hasn t seen Hen? He s serving you
like me, my boys! You wait--Still we love  em. 

 Are you now satisfied?  Henry asked.

Margaret began to grow frightened.  I don t know what it is all about, 
 she said.  Let s come in. 

But he thought she was acting. He thought he was trapped. He saw his
whole life crumbling.  Don t you indeed?  he said bitingly.  I do. Allow
me to congratulate you on the success of your plan. 

 This is Helen s plan, not mine. 

 I now understand your interest in the Basts. Very well thought out.
I am amused at your caution, Margaret. You are quite right--it was
necessary. I am a man, and have lived a man s past. I have the honour to
release you from your engagement. 

Still she could not understand. She knew of life s seamy side as a
theory; she could not grasp it as a fact. More words from Jacky were
necessary--words unequivocal, undenied.

 So that--  burst from her, and she went indoors. She stopped herself
from saying more.

 So what?  asked Colonel Fussell, who was getting ready to start in the
hall.

 We were saying--Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument, my
point being--  Seizing his fur coat from a footman, she offered to help
him on. He protested, and there was a playful little scene.

 No, let me do that,  said Henry, following.

 Thanks so much! You see--he has forgiven me! 

The Colonel said gallantly:  I don t expect there s much to forgive. 

He got into the car. The ladies followed him after an interval.
Maids, courier, and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the
branch-line. Still chattering, still thanking their host and patronising
their future hostess, the guests were borne away.

Then Margaret continued:  So that woman has been your mistress? 

 You put it with your usual delicacy,  he replied.

 When, please? 

 Why? 

 When, please? 

 Ten years ago. 

She left him without a word. For it was not her tragedy; it was Mrs.
Wilcox s.

",next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula  the weather promised well  and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that margaret watched it  presently she saw the keep  and the sun painted the rubble gold  and charged the white sky with blue  the shadow of the house gathered itself together  and fell over the garden  a cat looked up at her window and mewed  lastly the river appeared  still holding the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders  and only visible as far as a hill  which cut off its upper reaches   margaret was fascinated by oniton  she had said that she loved it  but it was rather its romantic tension that held her  the rounded druids of whom she had caught glimpses in her drive  the rivers hurrying down from them to england  the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills  thrilled her with poetry  the house was insignificant  but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy  and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it  and of the conversion of henry himself to a rural life  society  too  promised favourably  the rector of the parish had dined with them last night  and she found that he was a friend of her father s  and so knew what to find in her  she liked him  he would introduce her to the town  while  on her other side  sir james bidder sat  repeating that she only had to give the word  and he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round  whether sir james  who was garden seeds  had promised what he could perform  she doubted  but so long as henry mistook them for the county families when they did call  she was content   charles wilcox and albert fussell now crossed the lawn  they were going for a morning dip  and a servant followed them with their bathing suits  she had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast  but saw that the day was still sacred to men  and amused herself by watching their contretemps  in the first place the key of the bathing she would could not be found  charles stood by the riverside with folded hands  tragical  while the servant shouted  and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden  then came a difficulty about a springboard  and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow  with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies  if margaret wanted to jump from a motor car  she jumped  if tibby thought paddling would benefit his ankles  he paddled  if a clerk desired adventure  he took a walk in the dark  but these athletes seemed paralysed  they could not bathe without their appliances  though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream  had they found the life of the body after all  could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat them  even on their own ground   she thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day  no worrying of servants  no appliances  beyond good sense  her reflections were disturbed by the quiet child  who had come out to speak to the cat  but was now watching her watch the men  she called   good morning  dear   a little sharply  her voice spread consternation  charles looked round  and though completely attired in indigo blue  vanished into the she would  and was seen no more    miss wilcox is up    the child whispered  and then became unintelligible    what is that   it sounded like     cut yoke  sack back      i can t hear       on the bed  tissue paper     gathering that the wedding dress was on view  and that a visit would be seemly  she went to evie s room  all was hilarity here  evie  in a petticoat  was dancing with one of the anglo indian ladies  while the other was adoring yards of white satin  they screamed  they laughed  they sang  and the dog barked   margaret screamed a little too  but without conviction  she could not feel that a wedding was so funny  perhaps something was missing in her equipment   evie gasped   dolly is a rotter not to be here  oh  we would rag just then   then margaret went down to breakfast   henry was already installed  he ate slowly and spoke little  and was  in margaret s eyes  the only member of their party who dodged emotion successfully  she could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife  yet he dwelt intact  only issuing orders occasionally  orders that promoted the comfort of his guests  he inquired after her hand  he set her to pour out the coffee and mrs  warrington to pour out the tea  when evie came down there was a moment s awkwardness  and both ladies rose to vacate their places   burton   called henry   serve tea and coffee from the sideboard   it wasn t genuine tact  but it was tact  of a sort  the sort that is as useful as the genuine  and saves even more situations at board meetings  henry treated a marriage like a funeral  item by item  never raising his eyes to the whole  and  death  where is thy sting  love  where is thy victory   one would exclaim at the close   after breakfast margaret claimed a few words with him  it was always best to approach him formally  she asked for the interview  because he was going on to shoot grouse to morrow  and she was returning to helen in town    certainly  dear   said he   of course  i have the time  what do you want     nothing     i was afraid something had gone wrong     no  i have nothing to say  but you may talk    glancing at his watch  he talked of the nasty curve at the lych gate  she heard him with interest  her surface could always respond to his without contempt  though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him  she had abandoned any plan of action  love is the best  and the more she let herself love him  the more chance was there that he would set his soul in order  such a moment as this  when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future home  was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to him  each lift of his eyes  each parting of the thatched lip from the clean shaven  must prelude the tenderness that kills the monk and the beast at a single blow  disappointed a hundred times  she still hoped  she loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness  whether he droned trivialities  as to day  or sprang kisses on her in the twilight  she could pardon him  she could respond    if there is this nasty curve   she suggested   couldn t we walk to the church  not  of course  you and evie  but the rest of us might very well go on first  and that would mean fewer carriages     one can t have ladies walking through the market square  the fussells wouldn t like it  they were awfully particular at charles s wedding  my  she  our party was anxious to walk  and certainly the church was just round the corner  and i shouldn t have minded  but the colonel made a great point of it     you men shouldn t be so chivalrous   said margaret thoughtfully    why not    she knew why not  but said that she did not know  he then announced that  unless she had anything special to say  he must visit the wine cellar  and they went off together in search of burton  though clumsy and a little inconvenient  oniton was a genuine country house  they clattered down flagged passages  looking into room after room  and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties  the wedding breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church  and tea would be served in the garden  the sight of so many agitated and serious people made margaret smile  but she reflected that they were paid to be serious  and enjoyed being agitated  here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing evie up into nuptial glory  a little boy blocked their way with pig pails  his mind could not grasp their greatness  and he said   by your leave  let me pass  please    henry asked him where burton was  but the servants were so new that they did not know one another s names  in the still room sat the band  who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee  and who were already drinking beer  scents of araby came from the kitchen  mingled with cries  margaret knew what had happened there  for it happened at wickham place  one of the wedding dishes had boiled over  and the cook was throwing cedar shavings to hide the smell  at last they came upon the butler  henry gave him the keys  and handed margaret down the cellar stairs  two doors were unlocked  she  who kept all her wine at the bottom of the linen cupboard  was astonished at the sight   we shall never get through it   she cried  and the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood  and exchanged smiles  she felt as if she had again jumped out of the car while it was moving   certainly oniton would take some digesting  it would be no small business to remain herself  and yet to assimilate such an establishment  she must remain herself  for his sake as well as her own  since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies  and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty  since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable  her only ally was the power of home  the loss of wickham place had taught her more than its possession  howards end had repeated the lesson  she was determined to create new sanctities among these hills   after visiting the wine cellar  she dressed  and then came the wedding  which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it  everything went like one o clock  mr  cahill materialised out of space  and was waiting for his bride at the church door  no one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses  or trod on evie s train  or cried  in a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty  the register was signed  and they were back in their carriages  negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych gate  margaret was convinced that they had not been married at all  and that the norman church had been intent all the time on other business   there were more documents to sign at the house  and the breakfast to eat  and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party  there had been a great many refusals  and after all it was not a very big affair  not as big as margaret s would be  she noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet  that outwardly she might give henry what was proper  but inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of sunday church and fox hunting  if only some one had been upset  but this wedding had gone off so particularly well   quite like a durbar  in the opinion of lady edser  and she thoroughly agreed with her   so the wasted day lumbered forward  the bride and bridegroom drove off  yelling with laughter  and for the second time the sun retreated towards the hills of wales  henry  who was more tired than he owned  came up to her in the castle meadow  and  in tones of unusual softness  said that he was pleased  everything had gone off so well  she felt that he was praising her  too  and blushed  certainly she had done all she could with his intractable friends  and had made a special point of kotowing to the men  they were breaking camp this evening  only the warringtons and quiet child would stay the night  and the others were already moving towards the house to finish their packing   i think it did go off well   she agreed   since i had to jump out of the motor  i m thankful i lighted on my left hand  i am so very glad about it  henry dear  i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable  you must all remember that we have no practical person among us  except my aunt  and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale     i know   he said gravely   under the circumstances  it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s  or even to go to some hotel     you desire a hotel     yes  because  well  i mustn t interfere with you  no doubt you want to be married from your old home     my old home s falling into pieces  henry  i only want my new  isn t it a perfect evening      the alexandrina isn t bad      the alexandrina   she echoed  more occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys  and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey    it s off curzon street     is it  let s be married from off curzon street    then she turned westward  to gaze at the swirling gold  just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it  fairyland must lie above the bend  and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past charles s bathing she would  she gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled  and when they moved back to the house  she could not recognise the faces of people who were coming out of it  a parlour maid was preceding them    who are those people   she asked    they re callers   exclaimed henry   it s too late for callers     perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents     i m not at home yet to townees     well  hide among the ruins  and if i can stop them  i will    he thanked her   margaret went forward  smiling socially  she supposed that these were unpunctual guests  who would have to be content with vicarious civility  since evie and charles were gone  henry tired  and the others in their rooms  she assumed the airs of a hostess  not for long  for one of the group was helen  helen in her oldest clothes  and dominated by that tense  wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery days    what is it   she called   oh  what s wrong  is tibby ill    helen spoke to her two companions  who fell back  then she bore forward furiously    they re starving   she shouted   i found them starving     who  why have you come     the basts     oh  helen   moaned margaret   whatever have you done now     he has lost his place  he has been turned out of his bank  yes  he s done for  we upper classes have ruined him  and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life  starving  his wife is ill  starving  she fainted in the train     helen  are you mad     perhaps  yes  if you like  i m mad  but i ve brought them  i ll stand injustice no longer  i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury  this talk of impersonal forces  this cannot about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves     have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire  helen    helen was checked  she had not thought of this  and her hysteria abated   there was a restaurant car on the train   she said    don t be absurd  they aren t starving  and you know it  now  begin from the beginning  i won t have such theatrical nonsense  how dare you  yes  how dare you   she repeated  as anger filled her   bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way  my goodness  but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy  look   she indicated the house   servants  people out of the windows  they think it s some vulgar scandal  and i must explain   oh no  it s only my sister screaming  and only two hangers on of ours  whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason      kindly take back that word  hangers on    said helen  ominously calm    very well   conceded margaret  who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel   i  too  am sorry about them  but it beats me why you ve brought them here  or why you re here yourself     it s our last chance of seeing mr  wilcox    margaret moved towards the house at this  she was determined not to worry henry    he s going to scotland  i know he is  i insist on seeing him     yes  to morrow     i knew it was our last chance     how do you do  mr  bast   said margaret  trying to control her voice   this is an odd business  what view do you take of it     there is mrs  bast  too   prompted helen   jacky also shook hands  she  like her husband  was shy  and  furthermore  ill  and furthermore  so bestially stupid that she could not grasp what was happening  she only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last night  had paid the rent  redeemed the furniture  provided them with a dinner and a breakfast  and ordered them to meet her at paddington next morning  leonard had feebly protested  and when the morning came  had suggested that they shouldn t go  but she  half mesmerised  had obeyed  the lady had told them to  and they must  and their bed sitting room had accordingly changed into paddington  and paddington into a railway carriage  that shook  and grew hot  and grew cold  and vanished entirely  and reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent   you have fainted   said the lady in an awe struck voice   perhaps the air will do you good   and perhaps it had  for here she was  feeling rather better among a lot of flowers    i m sure i don t want to intrude   began leonard  in answer to margaret s question   but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered  why  i wondered whether      whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again   supplied helen   meg  this has been a cheerful business  a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment    margaret shook her head and returned to mr  bast    i don t understand  you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern  didn t you     that s right     and went into a bank instead     i told you all that   said helen   and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month  and now he s penniless  and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame     i hate all this   leonard muttered    i hope you do  mr  bast  but it s no good mincing matters  you have done yourself no good by coming here  if you intend to confront mr  wilcox  and to call him to account for a chance remark  you will make a very great mistake     i brought them  i did it all   cried helen    i can only advise you to go at once  my sister has put you in a false position  and it is kindest to tell you so  it s too late to get to town  but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton  where mrs  bast can rest  and i hope you ll be my guests there     that isn t what i want  miss schlegel   said leonard   you re very kind  and no doubt it s a false position  but you make me miserable  i seem no good at all     it s work he wants   interpreted helen   can t you see    then he said   jacky  let s go  we re more bother than we re worth  we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us  and they never will  there s nothing we re good enough to do     we would like to find you work   said margaret rather conventionally   we want to  i  like my sister  you re only down in your luck  go to the hotel  have a good night s rest  and some day you shall pay me back the bill  if you prefer it    but leonard was near the abyss  and at such moments men see clearly   you don t know what you re talking about   he said   i shall never get work now  if rich people fail at one profession  they can try another  not i  i had my groove  and i ve got out of it  i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary  but that s all  poetry s nothing  miss schlegel  one s thoughts about this and that are nothing  your money  too  is nothing  if you ll understand me  i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job  it s all over with him  i have seen it happen to others  their friends gave them money for a little  but in the end they fall over the edge  it s no good  it s the whole world pulling  there always will be rich and poor    he ceased   won t you have something to eat   said margaret   i don t know what to do  it isn t my house  and though mr  wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time  as i say  i don t know what to do  but i undertake to do what i can for you  helen  offer them something  do try a sandwich  mrs  bast    they moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing  iced cakes  sandwiches innumerable  coffee  claret cup  champagne  remained almost intact  their overfed guests could do no more  leonard refused  jacky thought she could manage a little  margaret left them whispering together  and had a few more words with helen   she said   helen  i like mr  bast  i agree that he s worth helping  i agree that we are directly responsible     no  indirectly  via mr  wilcox     let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude  i ll do nothing  no doubt you re right logically  and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry  only  i won t have it  so choose    helen looked at the sunset    if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them  in my own way  mind  there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice  i have no use for justice  if it was only a question of money  we could do it ourselves  but he wants work  and that we can t give him  but possibly henry can     it s his duty to   grumbled helen    nor am i concerned with duty  i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know  and how  things being as they are  things may be made a little better  mr  wilcox hates being asked favours  all business men do  but i am going to ask him  at the risk of a rebuff  because i want to make things a little better     very well  i promise  you take it very calmly     take them off to the george  then  and i ll try  poor creatures  but they look tired   as they parted  she added   i haven t nearly done with you  though  helen  you have been most self indulgent  i can t get over it  you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older  think it over and alter yourself  or we shan t have happy lives    she rejoined henry  fortunately he had been sitting down  these physical matters were important   was it townees   he asked  greeting her with a pleasant smile    you ll never believe me   said margaret  sitting down beside him   it s all right now  but it was my sister     helen here   he cried  preparing to rise   but she refused the invitation  i thought hated weddings     don t get up  she has not come to the wedding  i ve bundled her off to the george    inherently hospitable  he protested    no  she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them     let  them all come     my dear henry  did you see them     i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman  certainly     the brown bunch was helen  but did you catch sight of a sea green and salmon bunch     what  are they out bean feasting     no  business  they wanted to see me  and later on i want to talk to you about them    she was ashamed of her own diplomacy  in dealing with a wilcox  how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship  and to give him the kind of woman that he desired  henry took the hint at once  and said   why later on  tell me now  no time like the present     shall i     if it isn t a long story     oh  not five minutes  but there s a sting at the end of it  for i want you to find the man some work in your office     what are his qualifications     i don t know  he s a clerk     how old     twenty five  perhaps     what s his

why did he leave   he asked  still remembering nothing    they reduced their staff     all right  i ll see him    it was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day  now she understood why some women prefer influence to rights  mrs  plynlimmon  when condemning suffragettes  had said   the woman who can t influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself    margaret had winced  but she was influencing henry now  and though pleased at her little victory  she knew that she had won it by the methods of the harem    i should be glad if you took him   she said   but i don t know whether he s qualified     i ll do what i can  but  margaret  this mustn t be taken as a precedent     no  of course  of course      i can t fit in your proteges every day  business would suffer     i can promise you he s the last  he  he s rather a special case     proteges always are    she let it stand at that  he rose with a little extra touch of complacency  and held out his hand to help her up  how wide the gulf between henry as he was and henry as helen thought he ought to be  and she herself  hovering as usual between the two  now accepting men as they are  now yearning with her sister for truth  love and truth  their warfare seems eternal  perhaps the whole visible world rests on it  and if they were one  life itself  like the spirits when prospero was

to her annoyance  mrs  bast was still in the garden  the husband and helen had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage rooms  margaret found this woman repellent  she had felt  when shaking her hand  an overpowering shame  she remembered the motive of her call at wickham place  and smelt again odours from the abyss  odours the more disturbing because they were involuntary  for there was no malice in jacky  there she sat  a piece of cake in one hand  an empty champagne glass in the other  doing no harm to anybody    she s overtired   margaret whispered    she s something

discountenanced risque conversations now   henry went up to the woman  she raised her face  which gleamed in the twilight like a puff ball    madam  you will be more comfortable at the hotel   he said sharply   jacky replied   if it isn t hen     ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble   apologised margaret   il est tout   fait diff rent     henry   she repeated  quite distinctly   mr  wilcox was much annoyed   i congratulate you on your proteges   he remarked    hen  don t go  you do love me  dear  don t you     bless us  what a person   sighed margaret  gathering up her skirts   jacky pointed with her cake   you re a nice boy  you are   she yawned   there now  i love you     henry  i am awfully sorry     and pray why   he asked  and looked at her so sternly that she feared he was ill  he seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded    to have brought this down on you     pray don t apologise    the voice continued    why does she call you  hen    said margaret innocently   has she ever seen you before     seen hen before   said jacky   who hasn t seen hen  he s serving you like me  my boys  you wait  still we love  them     are you now satisfied   henry asked   margaret began to grow frightened   i don t know what it is all about    she said   let s come in    but he thought she was acting  he thought he was trapped  he saw his whole life crumbling   don t you indeed   he said bitingly   i do  allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan     this is helen s plan  not mine     i now understand your interest in the basts  very well thought out  i am amused at your caution  margaret  you are quite right  it was necessary  i am a man  and have lived a man s past  i have the honour to release you from your engagement    still she could not

indoors  she stopped herself from saying more    so what   asked colonel fussell  who was getting ready to start in the hall    we were saying  henry and i were just having the fiercest argument  my

26,26,5836,5920,6005,"

Helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in
making some people ill and others angry. Now that the wave of excitement
was ebbing, and had left her, Mr. Bast, and Mrs. Bast stranded for the
night in a Shropshire hotel, she asked herself what forces had made the
wave flow. At all events, no harm was done. Margaret would play the game
properly now, and though Helen disapproved of her sister s methods, she
knew that the Basts would benefit by them in the long-run.

 Mr. Wilcox is so illogical,  she explained to Leonard, who had put his
wife to bed, and was sitting with her in the empty coffee-room.  If we
told him it was his duty to take you on, he might refuse to do it. The
fact is, he isn t properly educated. I don t want to set you against
him, but you ll find him a trial. 

 I can never thank you sufficiently, Miss Schlegel,  was all that
Leonard felt equal to.

 I believe in personal responsibility. Don t you? And in personal
everything. I hate--I suppose I oughtn t to say that--but the Wilcoxes
are on the wrong tack surely. Or perhaps it isn t their fault. Perhaps
the little thing that says  I  is missing out of the middle of their
heads, and then it s a waste of time to blame them. There s a nightmare
of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the
rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that
says  I.  Had you heard that? 

 I get no time for reading. 

 Had you thought it, then? That there are two kinds of people--our kind,
who live straight from the middle of their heads, and the other kind
who can t, because their heads have no middle? They can t say  I.  They
AREN T in fact, and so they re supermen. Pierpont Morgan has never said
 I  in his life. 

Leonard roused himself. If his benefactress wanted intellectual
conversation, she must have it. She was more important than his ruined
past.  I never got on to Nietzsche,  he said.  But I always understood
that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists. 

 Oh no, that s wrong,  replied Helen.  No superman ever said  I want, 
because  I want  must lead to the question,  Who am I?  and so to Pity
and to Justice. He only says  want.   Want Europe,  if he s Napoleon;
 want wives,  if he s Bluebeard;  want Botticelli,  if he s Pierpont
Morgan. Never the  I ; and if you could pierce through the superman,
you d find panic and emptiness in the middle. 

Leonard was silent for a moment. Then he said:  May I take it, Miss
Schlegel, that you and I are both the sort that say  I ? 

 Of course. 

 And your sister, too? 

 Of course,  repeated Helen, a little sharply. She was annoyed with
Margaret, but did not want her discussed.  All presentable people say
 I.  

 But Mr. Wilcox--he is not perhaps-- 

 I don t know that it s any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either. 

 Quite so, quite so,  he agreed. Helen asked herself why she had snubbed
him. Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise,
and then had pulled him up short. Was she afraid of him presuming? If
so, it was disgusting of her.

But he was thinking the snub quite natural. Everything she did was
natural, and incapable of causing offence. While the Miss Schlegels
were together he had felt them scarcely human--a sort of admonitory
whirligig. But a Miss Schlegel alone was different. She was in Helen s
case unmarried, in Margaret s about to be married, in neither case an
echo of her sister. A light had fallen at last into this rich upper
world, and he saw that it was full of men and women, some of whom were
more friendly to him than others. Helen had become  his  Miss Schlegel,
who scolded him and corresponded with him, and had swept down yesterday
with grateful vehemence. Margaret, though not unkind, was severe and
remote. He would not presume to help her, for instance. He had never
liked her, and began to think that his original impression was true,
and that her sister did not like her either. Helen was certainly lonely.
She, who gave away so much, was receiving too little. Leonard was
pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue
and concealing what he knew about Mr. Wilcox. Jacky had announced her
discovery when he fetched her from the lawn. After the first shock, he
did not mind for himself. By now he had no illusions about his wife, and
this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been
pure. To keep perfection perfect, that should be his ideal, if the
future gave him time to have ideals. Helen, and Margaret for Helen s
sake, must not know.

Helen disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife.  Mrs.
Bast--does she ever say  I ?  she asked, half mischievously, and then,
 Is she very tired? 

 It s better she stops in her room,  said Leonard.

 Shall I sit up with her? 

 No, thank you; she does not need company. 

 Mr. Bast, what kind of woman is your wife? 

Leonard blushed up to his eyes.

 You ought to know my ways by now. Does that question offend you? 

 No, oh no, Miss Schlegel, no. 

 Because I love honesty. Don t pretend your marriage has been a happy
one. You and she can have nothing in common. 

He did not deny it, but said shyly:  I suppose that s pretty obvious;
but Jacky never meant to do anybody any harm. When things went wrong,
or I heard things, I used to think it was her fault, but, looking back,
it s more mine. I needn t have married her, but as I have I must stick
to her and keep her. 

 How long have you been married? 

 Nearly three years. 

 What did your people say? 

 They will not have anything to do with us. They had a sort of family
council when they heard I was married, and cut us off altogether. 

Helen began to pace up and down the room.  My good boy, what a mess! 
 she said gently.  Who are your people? 

He could answer this. His parents, who were dead, had been in trade; his
sisters had married commercial travellers; his brother was a lay-reader.

 And your grandparents? 

Leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now.  They
were just nothing at all,  he said  agricultural labourers and that
sort. 

 So! From which part? 

 Lincolnshire mostly, but my mother s father--he, oddly enough, came
from these parts round here. 

 From this very Shropshire. Yes, that is odd. My mother s people were
Lancashire. But why do your brother and your sisters object to Mrs.
Bast? 

 Oh, I don t know. 

 Excuse me, you do know. I am not a baby. I can bear anything you tell
me, and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help. Have they
heard anything against her? 

He was silent.

 I think I have guessed now,  said Helen very gravely.

 I don t think so, Miss Schlegel; I hope not. 

 We must be honest, even over these things. I have guessed. I am
frightfully, dreadfully sorry, but it does not make the least difference
to me. I shall feel just the same to both of you. I blame, not your wife
for these things, but men. 

Leonard left it at that--so long as she did not guess the man. She stood
at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds. The hotel looked over a
dark square. The mists had begun. When she turned back to him her eyes
were shining.  Don t you worry,  he pleaded.  I can t bear that. We
shall be all right if I get work. If I could only get work--something
regular to do. Then it wouldn t be so bad again. I don t trouble after
books as I used. I can imagine that with regular work we should settle
down again. It stops one thinking. 

 Settle down to what? 

 Oh, just settle down. 

 And that s to be life!  said Helen, with a catch in her throat.  How
can you, with all the beautiful things to see and do--with music--with
walking at night-- 

 Walking is well enough when a man s in work,  he answered.  Oh, I did
talk a lot of nonsense once, but there s nothing like a bailiff in the
house to drive it out of you. When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and
Stevensons, I seemed to see life straight and real, and it isn t a
pretty sight. My books are back again, thanks to you, but they ll never
be the same to me again, and I shan t ever again think night in the
woods is wonderful. 

 Why not?  asked Helen, throwing up the window.

 Because I see one must have money. 

 Well, you re wrong. 

 I wish I was wrong, but--the clergyman--he has money of his own, or
else he s paid; the poet or the musician--just the same; the tramp--he s
no different. The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end, and is paid
for with other people s money. Miss Schlegel, the real thing s money, and
all the rest is a dream. 

 You re still wrong. You ve forgotten Death. 

Leonard could not understand.

 If we lived forever, what you say would be true. But we have to die,
we have to leave life presently. Injustice and greed would be the real
thing if we lived for ever. As it is, we must hold to other things,
because Death is coming. I love Death--not morbidly, but because He
explains. He shows me the emptiness of Money. Death and Money are the
eternal foes. Not Death and Life. Never mind what lies behind Death, Mr.
Bast, but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be
happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say,  I am I.  

 I wonder. 

 We are all in a mist--I know, but I can help you this far--men like
the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any. Sane, sound Englishmen!
building up empires, levelling all the world into what they call common
sense. But mention Death to them and they re offended, because Death s
really Imperial, and He cries out against them for ever. 

 I am as afraid of Death as any one. 

 But not of the idea of Death. 

 But what is the difference? 

 Infinite difference,  said Helen, more gravely than before.

Leonard looked at her wondering, and had the sense of great things
sweeping out of the shrouded night. But he could not receive them,
because his heart was still full of little things. As the lost umbrella
had spoilt the concert at Queen s Hall, so the lost situation was
obscuring the diviner harmonies now. Death, Life, and Materialism were
fine words, but would Mr. Wilcox take him on as a clerk? Talk as one
would, Mr. Wilcox was king of this world, the superman, with his own
morality, whose head remained in the clouds.

 I must be stupid,  he said apologetically.

While to Helen the paradox became clearer and clearer.  Death destroys a
man: the idea of Death saves him.  Behind the coffins and the skeletons
that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that
is great in us responds to it. Men of the world may recoil from the
charnel-house that they will one day enter, but Love knows better. Death
is his foe, but his peer, and in their age-long struggle the thews of
Love have been strengthened, and his vision cleared, until there is no
one who can stand against him.

 So never give in,  continued the girl, and restated again and again the
vague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible.
Her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened Leonard
to the earth. Woven of bitter experience, it resisted her. Presently
the waitress entered and gave her a letter from Margaret. Another note,
addressed to Leonard, was inside. They read them, listening to the
murmurings of the river.

sister  too     of course   repeated helen  a little sharply  she was annoyed with margaret  but did not want her discussed   all presentable people say  i      but mr  wilcox  he is not perhaps      i don t know that it s any good discussing mr  wilcox either     quite so  quite so   he agreed  helen asked herself why she had snubbed him  once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise  and then had pulled him up short  was she afraid of him presuming  if so  it was disgusting of her   but he was thinking the snub quite natural  everything she did was natural  and incapable of causing offence  while the miss schlegels were together he had felt them scarcely human  a sort of admonitory whirligig  but a miss schlegel alone was different  she was in helen s case unmarried  in margaret s about to be married  in neither case an echo of her sister  a light had fallen at last into this rich upper world  and he saw that it was full of men and women  some of whom were more friendly to him than others  helen had become  his  miss schlegel  who scolded him and corresponded with him  and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence  margaret  though not unkind  was severe and remote  he would not presume to help her  for instance  he had never liked her  and began to think that his original impression was true  and that her sister did not like her either  helen was certainly lonely  she  who gave away so much  was receiving too little  leonard was pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about mr  wilcox  jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn  after the first shock  he did not mind for himself  by now he had no illusions about his wife  and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure  to keep perfection perfect  that should be his ideal  if the future gave him time to have ideals  helen  and margaret for helen s sake  must not know   helen disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife   mrs  bast  does she ever say  i    she asked  half mischievously  and then   is she very tired     it s better she stops in her room   said leonard    shall i sit up with her     no  thank you  she does not need company     mr  bast  what kind of woman is your wife    leonard blushed up to his eyes    you ought to know my ways by now  does that question offend you     no  oh no  miss schlegel  no     because i love honesty  don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one  you and she can have nothing in common    he did not deny it  but said shyly   i suppose that s pretty obvious  but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm  when things went wrong  or i heard things  i used to think it was her fault  but  looking back  it s more mine  i needn t have married her  but as i have i must stick to her and keep her     how long have you been married     nearly three years     what did your people say     they will not have anything to do with us  they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married  and cut us off altogether    helen began to pace up and down the room   my good boy  what a mess    she said gently   who are your people    he could answer this  his parents  who were dead  had been in trade  his sisters had married commercial travellers  his brother was a lay reader    and your grandparents    leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now   they were just nothing at all   he said  agricultural labourers and that sort     so  from which part     lincolnshire mostly  but my mother s father  he  oddly enough  came from these parts round here     from this very shropshire  yes  that is odd  my mother s people were lancashire  but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs  bast     oh  i don t know     excuse me  you do know  i am not a baby  i can bear anything you tell me  and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help  have they heard anything against her    he was silent    i think i have guessed now   said helen very gravely    i don t think so  miss schlegel  i hope not     we must be honest  even over these things  i have guessed  i am frightfully  dreadfully sorry  but it does not make the least difference to me  i shall feel just the same to both of you  i blame  not your wife for these things  but men    leonard left it at that  so long as she did not guess the man  she stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds  the hotel looked over a dark square  the mists had begun  when she turned back to him her eyes were shining   don t you worry   he pleaded   i can t bear that  we shall be all right if i get work  if i could only get work  something regular to do  then it wouldn t be so bad again  i don t trouble after books as i used  i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again  it stops one thinking     settle down to what     oh  just settle down     and that s to be life   said helen  with a catch in her throat   how can you  with all the beautiful things to see and do  with music  with walking at night      walking is well enough when a man s in work   he answered   oh  i did talk a lot of nonsense once  but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you  when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons  i seemed to see life straight and real  and it isn t a pretty sight  my books are back again  thanks to you  but they ll never be the same to me again  and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful     why not   asked helen  throwing up the window    because i see one must have money     well  you re wrong     i wish i was wrong  but  the clergyman  he has money of his own  or else he s paid  the poet or the musician  just the same  the tramp  he s no different  the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end  and is paid for with other people s money  miss schlegel  the real thing s money  and all the rest is a dream     you re still wrong  you ve forgotten death    leonard could not understand    if we lived forever  what you say would be true  but we have to die  we have to leave life presently  injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever  as it is  we must hold to other things  because death is coming  i love death  not morbidly  but because he explains  he shows me the emptiness of money  death and money are the eternal foes  not death and life  never mind what lies behind death  mr  bast  but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say   i am i      i wonder     we are all in a mist  i know  but i can help you this far  men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any  sane  sound englishmen  building up empires  levelling all the world into what they call common sense  but mention death to them and they re offended  because death s really imperial  and he cries out against them for ever     i am as afraid of death as any one     but not of the idea of death     but what is the difference     infinite difference   said helen  more gravely than before   leonard looked at her wondering  and had the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night  but he could not receive them  because his heart was still full of little things  as the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at queen s hall  so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner harmonies now  death  life  and materialism were fine words  but would mr  wilcox take him on as a clerk  talk as one would  mr  wilcox was king of this world  the superman  with his own morality  whose head remained in the clouds    i must be stupid   he said apologetically   while to helen the paradox became clearer and clearer   death destroys a man  the idea of death saves him   behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it  men of the world may recoil from the charnel house that they will one day enter  but love knows better  death is his foe  but his peer  and in their age long struggle the thews of love have been strengthened  and his vision cleared  until there is no one who can stand against him    so never give in   continued the girl  and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the invisible lodges against the visible  her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened leonard to the earth  woven of bitter experience  it resisted her  presently the waitress entered and gave her a letter from margaret  another note  addressed to leonard  was inside  they read them  listening to the murmurings of the

27,27,6006,6051,6097,"

For many hours Margaret did nothing; then she controlled herself, and
wrote some letters. She was too bruised to speak to Henry; she could
pity him, and even determine to marry him, but as yet all lay too deep
in her heart for speech. On the surface the sense of his degradation was
too strong. She could not command voice or look, and the gentle words
that she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other
person.

 My dearest boy,  she began,  this is not to part us. It is everything
or nothing, and I mean it to be nothing. It happened long before we ever
met, and even if it had happened since, I should be writing the same, I
hope. I do understand. 

But she crossed out  I do understand ; it struck a false note. Henry
could not bear to be understood. She also crossed out,  It is everything
or nothing.  Henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation. She
must not comment; comment is unfeminine.

 I think that ll about do,  she thought.

Then the sense of his degradation choked her. Was he worth all this
bother? To have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything, yes,
it was, and she could not be his wife. She tried to translate his
temptation into her own language, and her brain reeled. Men must be
different even to want to yield to such a temptation. Her belief in
comradeship was stifled, and she saw life as from that glass saloon on
the Great Western which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh
air. Are the sexes really races, each with its own code of morality, and
their mutual love a mere device of Nature to keep things going? Strip
human intercourse of the proprieties, and is it reduced to this? Her
judgment told her no. She knew that out of Nature s device we have built
a magic that will win us immortality. Far more mysterious than the call
of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call; far wider
is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and
the garbage that nourishes it. We are evolving, in ways that Science
cannot measure, to ends that Theology dares not contemplate.  Men
did produce one jewel,  the gods will say, and, saying, will give us
immortality. Margaret knew all this, but for the moment she could not
feel it, and transformed the marriage of Evie and Mr. Cahill into a
carnival of fools, and her own marriage--too miserable to think of that,
she tore up the letter, and then wrote another:

 DEAR MR. BAST,

 I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you, as I promised, and am sorry to
say that he has no vacancy for you.

 Yours truly,

 M. J. SCHLEGEL. 

She enclosed this in a note to Helen, over which she took less trouble
than she might have done; but her head was aching, and she could not
stop to pick her words:

 DEAR HELEN,

 Give him this. The Basts are no good. Henry found the woman drunk on
the lawn. I am having a room got ready for you here, and will you please
come round at once on getting this? The Basts are not at all the type we
should trouble about. I may go round to them myself in the morning, and
do anything that is fair.

 M. 

In writing this, Margaret felt that she was being practical. Something
might be arranged for the Basts later on, but they must be silenced
for the moment. She hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman
and Helen. She rang the bell for a servant, but no one answered it;
Mr. Wilcox and the Warringtons were gone to bed, and the kitchen was
abandoned to Saturnalia. Consequently she went over to the George
herself. She did not enter the hotel, for discussion would have been
perilous, and, saying that the letter was important, she gave it to the
waitress. As she recrossed the square she saw Helen and Mr. Bast looking
out of the window of the coffee-room, and feared she was already too
late. Her task was not yet over; she ought to tell Henry what she had
done.

This came easily, for she saw him in the hall. The night wind had been
rattling the pictures against the wall, and the noise had disturbed him.

 Who s there?  he called, quite the householder.

Margaret walked in and past him.

 I have asked Helen to sleep,  she said.  She is best here; so don t
lock the front-door. 

 I thought some one had got in,  said Henry.

 At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him. I
don t know about later, but now the Basts must clearly go. 

 Did you say that your sister is sleeping here, after all? 

 Probably. 

 Is she to be shown up to your room? 

 I have naturally nothing to say to her; I am going to bed. Will you
tell the servants about Helen? Could some one go to carry her bag? 

He tapped a little gong, which had been bought to summon the servants.

 You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear. 

Henry opened a door, and down the corridor came shouts of laughter.  Far
too much screaming there,  he said, and strode towards it. Margaret went
upstairs, uncertain whether to be glad that they had met, or sorry. They
had behaved as if nothing had happened, and her deepest instincts told
her that this was wrong. For his own sake, some explanation was due.

And yet--what could an explanation tell her? A date, a place, a few
details, which she could imagine all too clearly. Now that the first
shock was over, she saw that there was every reason to premise a Mrs.
Bast. Henry s inner life had long laid open to her--his intellectual
confusion, his obtuseness to personal influence, his strong but furtive
passions. Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded?
Perhaps. Perhaps, if the dishonour had been done to her, but it was done
long before her day. She struggled against the feeling. She told herself
that Mrs. Wilcox s wrong was her own. But she was not a barren theorist.
As she undressed, her anger, her regard for the dead, her desire for a
scene, all grew weak. Henry must have it as he liked, for she loved him,
and some day she would use her love to make him a better man.

Pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis. Pity, if
one may generalise, is at the bottom of woman. When men like us, it is
for our better qualities, and however tender their liking, we dare not
be unworthy of it, or they will quietly let us go. But unworthiness
stimulates woman. It brings out her deeper nature, for good or for evil.

Here was the core of the question. Henry must be forgiven, and made
better by love; nothing else mattered. Mrs. Wilcox, that unquiet yet
kindly ghost, must be left to her own wrong. To her everything was in
proportion now, and she, too, would pity the man who was blundering
up and down their lives. Had Mrs. Wilcox known of his trespass? An
interesting question, but Margaret fell asleep, tethered by affection,
and lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from
Wales. She felt herself at one with her future home, colouring it and
coloured by it, and awoke to see, for the second time, Oniton Castle
conquering the morning mists.

28,28,6098,6188,6279,"

 Henry dear--  was her greeting.

He had finished his breakfast, and was beginning the Times. His
sister-in-law was packing. Margaret knelt by him and took the paper from
him, feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick. Then, putting her
face where it had been, she looked up in his eyes.

 Henry dear, look at me. No, I won t have you shirking. Look at me.
There. That s all. 

 You re referring to last evening,  he said huskily.  I have released
you from your engagement. I could find excuses, but I won t. No, I
won t. A thousand times no. I m a bad lot, and must be left at that. 

Expelled from his old fortress, Mr. Wilcox was building a new one.
He could no longer appear respectable to her, so he defended himself
instead in a lurid past. It was not true repentance.

 Leave it where you will, boy. It s not going to trouble us; I know what
I m talking about, and it will make no difference. 

 No difference?  he inquired.  No difference, when you find that I am
not the fellow you thought?  He was annoyed with Miss Schlegel here. He
would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow, or even to
rage. Against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not
altogether womanly. Her eyes gazed too straight; they had read books
that are suitable for men only. And though he had dreaded a scene, and
though she had determined against one, there was a scene, all the same.
It was somehow imperative.

 I am unworthy of you,  he began.  Had I been worthy, I should not have
released you from your engagement. I know what I am talking about. I
can t bear to talk of such things. We had better leave it. 

She kissed his hand. He jerked it from her, and, rising to his feet,
went on:  You, with your sheltered life, and refined pursuits, and
friends, and books, you and your sister, and women like you--I say, how
can you guess the temptations that lie round a man? 

 It is difficult for us,  said Margaret;  but if we are worth marrying,
we do guess. 

 Cut off from decent society and family ties, what do you suppose
happens to thousands of young fellows overseas? Isolated. No one near. I
know by bitter experience, and yet you say it makes  no difference.  

 Not to me. 

He laughed bitterly. Margaret went to the sideboard and helped herself
to one of the breakfast dishes. Being the last down, she turned out the
spirit-lamp that kept them warm. She was tender, but grave. She knew
that Henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf
between the male soul and the female, and she did not desire to hear him
on this point.

 Did Helen come?  she asked.

He shook his head.

 But that won t do at all, at all! We don t want her gossiping with Mrs.
Bast. 

 Good God! no!  he exclaimed, suddenly natural. Then he caught himself
up.  Let them gossip, my game s up, though I thank you for your
unselfishness--little as my thanks are worth. 

 Didn t she send me a message or anything? 

 I heard of none. 

 Would you ring the bell, please? 

 What to do? 

 Why, to inquire. 

He swaggered up to it tragically, and sounded a peal. Margaret poured
herself out some coffee. The butler came, and said that Miss Schlegel
had slept at the George, so far as he had heard. Should he go round to
the George?

 I ll go, thank you,  said Margaret, and dismissed him.

 It is no good,  said Henry.  Those things leak out; you cannot stop a
story once it has started. I have known cases of other men--I despised
them once, I thought that I m different, I shall never be tempted. Oh,
Margaret--  He came and sat down near her, improvising emotion. She
could not bear to listen to him.  We fellows all come to grief once in
our time. Will you believe that? There are moments when the strongest
man-- Let him who standeth, take heed lest he fall.  That s true,
isn t it? If you knew all, you would excuse me. I was far from good
influences--far even from England. I was very, very lonely, and longed
for a woman s voice. That s enough. I have told you too much already for
you to forgive me now. 

 Yes, that s enough, dear. 

 I have --he lowered his voice-- I have been through hell. 

Gravely she considered this claim. Had he? Had he suffered tortures of
remorse, or had it been,  There! that s over. Now for respectable life
again ? The latter, if she read him rightly. A man who has been through
hell does not boast of his virility. He is humble and hides it, if,
indeed, it still exists. Only in legend does the sinner come forth
penitent, but terrible, to conquer pure woman by his resistless power.
Henry was anxious to be terrible, but had not got it in him. He was a
good average Englishman, who had slipped. The really culpable point--his
faithlessness to Mrs. Wilcox--never seemed to strike him. She longed to
mention Mrs. Wilcox.

And bit by bit the story was told her. It was a very simple story. Ten
years ago was the time, a garrison town in Cyprus the place. Now and
then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him, and she
answered,  I have already forgiven you, Henry.  She chose her words
carefully, and so saved him from panic. She played the girl, until he
could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world. When the
butler came to clear away, Henry was in a very different mood--asked
the fellow what he was in such a hurry for, complained of the noise last
night in the servants  hall. Margaret looked intently at the butler. He,
as a handsome young man, was faintly attractive to her as a woman--an
attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible, yet the skies would
have fallen if she had mentioned it to Henry.

On her return from the George the building operations were complete, and
the old Henry fronted her, competent, cynical, and kind. He had made a
clean breast, had been forgiven, and the great thing now was to forget
his failure, and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments.
Jacky rejoined Howards End and Dude Street, and the vermilion motor-car,
and the Argentine Hard Dollars, and all the things and people for whom
he had never had much use and had less now. Their memory hampered him.
He could scarcely attend to Margaret, who brought back disquieting news
from the George. Helen and her clients had gone.

 Well, let them go--the man and his wife, I mean, for the more we see of
your sister the better. 

 But they have gone separately--Helen very early, the Basts just before
I arrived. They have left no message. They have answered neither of my
notes. I don t like to think what it all means. 

 What did you say in the notes? 

 I told you last night. 

 Oh--ah--yes! Dear, would you like one turn in the garden? 

Margaret took his arm. The beautiful weather soothed her. But the wheels
of Evie s wedding were still at work, tossing the guests outwards as
deftly as they had drawn them in, and she could not be with him long. It
had been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury, whence he would
go north, and she back to London with the Warringtons. For a fraction of
time she was happy. Then her brain recommenced.

 I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George. Helen
would not have left unless she had heard something. I mismanaged that.
It is wretched. I ought to have parted her from that woman at once. 

 Margaret!  he exclaimed, loosing her arm impressively.

 Yes--yes, Henry? 

 I am far from a saint--in fact, the reverse--but you have taken me, for
better or worse. Bygones must be bygones. You have promised to forgive
me. Margaret, a promise is a promise. Never mention that woman again. 

 Except for some practical reason--never. 

 Practical! You practical! 

 Yes, I m practical,  she murmured, stooping over the mowing-machine and
playing with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand.

He had silenced her, but her fears made him uneasy. Not for the first
time, he was threatened with blackmail. He was rich and supposed to be
moral; the Basts knew that he was not, and might find it profitable to
hint as much.

 At all events, you mustn t worry,  he said.  This is a man s business. 
 He thought intently.  On no account mention it to anybody. 

Margaret flushed at advice so elementary, but he was really paving the
way for a lie. If necessary he would deny that he had ever known Mrs.
Bast, and prosecute her for libel. Perhaps he never had known her. Here
was Margaret, who behaved as if he had not. There the house. Round them
were half a dozen gardeners, clearing up after his daughter s wedding.
All was so solid and spruce, that the past flew up out of sight like a
spring-blind, leaving only the last five minutes unrolled.

Glancing at these, he saw that the car would be round during the
next five, and plunged into action. Gongs were tapped, orders issued,
Margaret was sent to dress, and the housemaid to sweep up the long
trickle of grass that she had left across the hall. As is Man to the
Universe, so was the mind of Mr. Wilcox to the minds of some men--a
concentrated light upon a tiny spot, a little Ten Minutes moving
self-contained through its appointed years. No Pagan he, who lives for
the Now, and may be wiser than all philosophers. He lived for the five
minutes that have past, and the five to come; he had the business mind.

How did he stand now, as his motor slipped out of Oniton and breasted
the great round hills? Margaret had heard a certain rumour, but was all
right. She had forgiven him, God bless her, and he felt the manlier for
it. Charles and Evie had not heard it, and never must hear. No more must
Paul. Over his children he felt great tenderness, which he did not try
to track to a cause; Mrs. Wilcox was too far back in his life. He did
not connect her with the sudden aching love that he felt for Evie. Poor
little Evie! he trusted that Cahill would make her a decent husband.

And Margaret? How did she stand?

She had several minor worries. Clearly her sister had heard something.
She dreaded meeting her in town. And she was anxious about Leonard, for
whom they certainly were responsible. Nor ought Mrs. Bast to starve. But
the main situation had not altered. She still loved Henry. His actions,
not his disposition, had disappointed her, and she could bear that. And
she loved her future home. Standing up in the car, just where she had
leapt from it two days before, she gazed back with deep emotion upon
Oniton. Besides the Grange and the Castle keep, she could now pick out
the church and the black-and-white gables of the George. There was the
bridge, and the river nibbling its green peninsula. She could even
see the bathing-shed, but while she was looking for Charles s new
spring-board, the forehead of the hill rose and hid the whole scene.

She never saw it again. Day and night the river flows down into England,
day after day the sun retreats into the Welsh mountains, and the tower
chimes, See the Conquering Hero. But the Wilcoxes have no part in the
place, nor in any place. It is not their names that recur in the parish
register. It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening.
They have swept into the valley and swept out of it, leaving a little
dust and a little money behind.

Tibby was now approaching his last year at Oxford. He had moved out of
college, and was contemplating the Universe, or such portions of it as
concerned him, from his comfortable lodgings in Long Wall. He was not
concerned with much. When a young man is untroubled by passions and
sincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily
limited. Tibby wished neither to strengthen the position of the rich nor
to improve that of the poor, and so was well content to watch the elms
nodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of Magdalen. There are
worse lives. Though selfish, he was never cruel; though affected
in manner, he never posed. Like Margaret, he disdained the heroic
equipment, and it was only after many visits that men discovered
Schlegel to possess a character and a brain. He had done well in Mods,
much to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper
exercise, and was now glancing disdainfully at Chinese in case he
should some day consent to qualify as a Student Interpreter. To him thus
employed Helen entered. A telegram had preceded her.

He noticed, in a distant way, that his sister had altered.

As a rule he found her too pronounced, and had never come across this
look of appeal, pathetic yet dignified--the look of a sailor who has
lost everything at sea.

 I have come from Oniton,  she began.  There has been a great deal of
trouble there. 

 Who s for lunch?  said Tibby, picking up the claret, which was warming
in the hearth. Helen sat down submissively at the table.  Why such an
early start?  he asked.

 Sunrise or something--when I could get away. 

 So I surmise. Why? 

 I don t know what s to be done, Tibby. I am very much upset at a piece
of news that concerns Meg, and do not want to face her, and I am not
going back to Wickham Place. I stopped here to tell you this. 

The landlady came in with the cutlets. Tibby put a marker in the leaves
of his Chinese Grammar and helped them. Oxford--the Oxford of the
vacation--dreamed and rustled outside, and indoors the little fire was
coated with grey where the sunshine touched it. Helen continued her odd
story.

 Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone. I mean to go to
Munich or else Bonn. 

 Such a message is easily given,  said her brother.

 As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture, you and she are
to do exactly as you like. My own feeling is that everything may just as
well be sold. What does one want with dusty economic books, which have
made the world no better, or with mother s hideous chiffoniers? I have
also another commission for you. I want you to deliver a letter.  She
got up.  I haven t written it yet. Why shouldn t I post it, though?  She
sat down again.  My head is rather wretched. I hope that none of your
friends are likely to come in. 

Tibby locked the door. His friends often found it in this condition.
Then he asked whether anything had gone wrong at Evie s wedding.

 Not there,  said Helen, and burst into tears.

He had known her hysterical--it was one of her aspects with which he had
no concern--and yet these tears touched him as something unusual. They
were nearer the things that did concern him, such as music. He laid down
his knife and looked at her curiously. Then, as she continued to sob, he
went on with his lunch.

The time came for the second course, and she was still crying. Apple
Charlotte was to follow, which spoils by waiting.  Do you mind Mrs.
Martlett coming in?  he asked,  or shall I take it from her at the
door? 

 Could I bathe my eyes, Tibby? 

He took her to his bedroom, and introduced the pudding in her absence.
Having helped himself, he put it down to warm in the hearth. His hand
stretched towards the Grammar, and soon he was turning over the pages,
raising his eyebrows scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at
Chinese. To him thus employed Helen returned. She had pulled herself
together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes.

 Now for the explanation,  she said.  Why didn t I begin with it? I
have found out something about Mr. Wilcox. He has behaved very wrongly
indeed, and ruined two people s lives. It all came on me very suddenly
last night; I am very much upset, and I do not know what to do. Mrs.
Bast-- 

 Oh, those people! 

Helen seemed silenced.

 Shall I lock the door again? 

 No thanks, Tibbikins. You re being very good to me. I want to tell you
the story before I go abroad, you must do exactly what you like--treat
it as part of the furniture. Meg cannot have heard it yet, I think. But
I cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has
misconducted himself. I don t even know whether she ought to be told.
Knowing as she does that I dislike him, she will suspect me, and think
that I want to ruin her match. I simply don t know what to make of such
a thing. I trust your judgment. What would you do? 

 I gather he has had a mistress,  said Tibby.

Helen flushed with shame and anger.  And ruined two people s lives. And
goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing, and there
always will be rich and poor. He met her when he was trying to get rich
out in Cyprus--I don t wish to make him worse than he is, and no doubt
she was ready enough to meet him. But there it is. They met. He goes his
way and she goes hers. What do you suppose is the end of such women? 

He conceded that it was a bad business.

 They end in two ways: Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the
workhouses are full of them, and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to
the papers complaining of our national degeneracy, or else they entrap a
boy into marriage before it is too late. She--I can t blame her. 

 But this isn t all,  she continued after a long pause, during which the
landlady served them with coffee.  I come now to the business that took
us to Oniton. We went all three. Acting on Mr. Wilcox s advice, the man
throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one, from which he is
dismissed. There are certain excuses, but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to
blame, as Meg herself admitted. It is only common justice that he should
employ the man himself. But he meets the woman, and, like the cur that
he is, he refuses, and tries to get rid of them. He makes Meg write.
Two notes came from her late that evening--one for me, one for Leonard,
dismissing him with barely a reason. I couldn t understand. Then it
comes out that Mrs. Bast had spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we
left her to get rooms, and was still speaking about him when Leonard
came back to her. This Leonard knew all along. He thought it natural he
should be ruined twice. Natural! Could you have contained yourself? 

 It is certainly a very bad business,  said Tibby.

His reply seemed to calm his sister.  I was afraid that I saw it out of
proportion. But you are right outside it, and you must know. In a day or
two--or perhaps a week--take whatever steps you think fit. I leave it in
your hands. 

She concluded her charge.

 The facts as they touch Meg are all before you,  she added; and Tibby
sighed and felt it rather hard that, because of his open mind, he should
be empanelled to serve as a juror. He had never been interested in human
beings, for which one must blame him, but he had had rather too much of
them at Wickham Place. Just as some people cease to attend when books
are mentioned, so Tibby s attention wandered when  personal relations 
 came under discussion. Ought Margaret to know what Helen knew the Basts
to know? Similar questions had vexed him from infancy, and at Oxford he
had learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly
overrated by specialists. The epigram, with its faint whiff of the
eighties, meant nothing. But he might have let it off now if his sister
had not been ceaselessly beautiful.

 You see, Helen--have a cigarette--I don t see what I m to do. 

 Then there s nothing to be done. I dare say you are right. Let them
marry. There remains the question of compensation. 

 Do you want me to adjudicate that too? Had you not better consult an
expert? 

 This part is in confidence,  said Helen.  It has nothing to do with
Meg, and do not mention it to her. The compensation--I do not see who is
to pay it if I don t, and I have already decided on the minimum sum.
As soon as possible I am placing it to your account, and when I am in
Germany you will pay it over for me. I shall never forget your kindness,
Tibbikins, if you do this. 

 What is the sum? 

 Five thousand. 

 Good God alive!  said Tibby, and went crimson.

 Now, what is the good of driblets? To go through life having done one
thing--to have raised one person from the abyss; not these puny gifts of
shillings and blankets--making the grey more grey. No doubt people will
think me extraordinary. 

 I don t care an iota what people think!  cried he, heated to unusual
manliness of diction.  But it s half what you have. 

 Not nearly half.  She spread out her hands over her soiled skirt.  I
have far too much, and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three
hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet. What I give will
bring in a hundred and fifty between two. It isn t enough.  He could not
recover. He was not angry or even shocked, and he saw that Helen would
still have plenty to live on. But it amazed him to think what haycocks
people can make of their lives. His delicate intonations would not work,
and he could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a
great deal of bother for him personally.

 I didn t expect you to understand me. 

 I? I understand nobody. 

 But you ll do it? 

 Apparently. 

 I leave you two commissions, then. The first concerns Mr. Wilcox, and
you are to use your discretion. The second concerns the money, and is
to be mentioned to no one, and carried out literally. You will send a
hundred pounds on account to-morrow. 

He walked with her to the station, passing through those streets whose
serried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued. The lovely
creature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue, and only
the ganglion of vulgarity round Carfax showed how evanescent was the
phantom, how faint its claim to represent England. Helen, rehearsing her
commission, noticed nothing; the Basts were in her brain, and she retold
the crisis in a meditative way, which might have made other men curious.
She was seeing whether it would hold. He asked her once why she had
taken the Basts right into the heart of Evie s wedding. She stopped like
a frightened animal and said,  Does that seem to you so odd?  Her eyes,
the hand laid on the mouth, quite haunted him, until they were absorbed
into the figure of St. Mary the Virgin, before whom he paused for a
moment on the walk home.

It is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties. Margaret
summoned him the next day. She was terrified at Helen s flight, and he
had to say that she had called in at Oxford. Then she said:  Did she
seem worried at any rumour about Henry?  He answered,  Yes.   I knew it
was that!  she exclaimed.  I ll write to her.  Tibby was relieved.

He then sent the cheque to the address that Helen gave him, and stated
that he was instructed to forward later on five thousand pounds. An
answer came back very civil and quiet in tone--such an answer as Tibby
himself would have given. The cheque was returned, the legacy refused,
the writer being in no need of money. Tibby forwarded this to Helen,
adding in the fulness of his heart that Leonard Bast seemed somewhat a
monumental person after all. Helen s reply was frantic. He was to
take no notice. He was to go down at once and say that she commanded
acceptance. He went. A scurf of books and china ornaments awaited him.
The Basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent, and had
wandered no one knew whither. Helen had begun bungling with her money by
this time, and had even sold out her shares in the Nottingham and Derby
Railway. For some weeks she did nothing. Then she reinvested, and, owing
to the good advice of her stockbrokers, became rather richer than she
had been before.

Houses have their own ways of dying, falling as variously as the
generations of men, some with a tragic roar, some quietly, but to an
after-life in the city of ghosts, while from others--and thus was the
death of Wickham Place--the spirit slips before the body perishes. It
had decayed in the spring, disintegrating the girls more than they knew,
and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions. By September it was a
corpse, void of emotion, and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty
years of happiness. Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture,
and pictures, and books, until the last room was gutted and the last van
had rumbled away. It stood for a week or two longer, open-eyed, as if
astonished at its own emptiness. Then it fell. Navvies came, and spilt
it back into the grey. With their muscles and their beery good temper,
they were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been
human, and had not mistaken culture for an end.

The furniture, with a few exceptions, went down into Hertfordshire, Mr.
Wilcox having most kindly offered Howards End as a warehouse. Mr. Bryce
had died abroad--an unsatisfactory affair--and as there seemed little
guarantee that the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the
agreement, and resumed possession himself. Until he relet the house, the
Schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower
rooms. Margaret demurred, but Tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved
him from coming to any decision about the future. The plate and the
more valuable pictures found a safer home in London, but the bulk of the
things went country-ways, and were entrusted to the guardianship of Miss
Avery.

Shortly before the move, our hero and heroine were married. They
have weathered the storm, and may reasonably expect peace. To have no
illusions and yet to love--what stronger surety can a woman find? She
had seen her husband s past as well as his heart. She knew her own heart
with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible. The
heart of Mrs. Wilcox was alone hidden, and perhaps it is superstitious
to speculate on the feelings of the dead. They were married
quietly--really quietly, for as the day approached she refused to go
through another Oniton. Her brother gave her away, her aunt, who was
out of health, presided over a few colourless refreshments. The Wilcoxes
were represented by Charles, who witnessed the marriage settlement, and
by Mr. Cahill. Paul did send a cablegram. In a few minutes, and without
the aid of music, the clergyman made them man and wife, and soon the
glass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world.
She, a monogamist, regretted the cessation of some of life s innocent
odours; he, whose instincts were polygamous, felt morally braced by the
change and less liable to the temptations that had assailed him in the
past.

They spent their honeymoon near Innsbruck. Henry knew of a reliable
hotel there, and Margaret hoped for a meeting with her sister. In this
she was disappointed. As they came south, Helen retreated over the
Brenner, and wrote an unsatisfactory post-card from the shores of the
Lake of Garda, saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be
ignored. Evidently she disliked meeting Henry. Two months are surely
enough to accustom an outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted
in two days, and Margaret had again to regret her sister s lack of
self-control. In a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in
sexual matters; so little is known about them; it is hard enough for
those who are personally touched to judge; then how futile must be the
verdict of Society.  I don t say there is no standard, for that would
destroy morality; only that there can be no standard until our impulses
are classified and better understood.  Helen thanked her for her kind
letter--rather a curious reply. She moved south again, and spoke of
wintering in Naples.

Mr. Wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed. Helen left him time to
grow skin over his wound. There were still moments when it pained him.
Had he only known that Margaret was awaiting him--Margaret, so lively
and intelligent, and yet so submissive--he would have kept himself
worthier of her. Incapable of grouping the past, he confused the episode
of Jacky with another episode that had taken place in the days of his
bachelorhood. The two made one crop of wild oats, for which he was
heartily sorry, and he could not see that those oats are of a darker
stock which are rooted in another s dishonour. Unchastity and infidelity
were as confused to him as to the Middle Ages, his only moral teacher.
Ruth (poor old Ruth!) did not enter into his calculations at all, for
poor old Ruth had never found him out.

His affection for his present wife grew steadily. Her cleverness gave
him no trouble, and, indeed, he liked to see her reading poetry or
something about social questions; it distinguished her from the wives
of other men. He had only to call, and she clapped the book up and was
ready to do what he wished. Then they would argue so jollily, and once
or twice she had him in quite a tight corner, but as soon as he grew
really serious, she gave in. Man is for war, woman for the recreation
of the warrior, but he does not dislike it if she makes a show of fight.
She cannot win in a real battle, having no muscles, only nerves.
Nerves make her jump out of a moving motor-car, or refuse to be
married fashionably. The warrior may well allow her to triumph on such
occasions; they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch
his peace.

Margaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon. He told
her--casually, as was his habit--that Oniton Grange was let. She showed
her annoyance, and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted.

 I didn t want to bother you,  he replied.  Besides, I have only heard
for certain this morning. 

 Where are we to live?  said Margaret, trying to laugh.  I loved the
place extraordinarily. Don t you believe in having a permanent home,
Henry? 

He assured her that she misunderstood him. It is home life that
distinguishes us from the foreigner. But he did not believe in a damp
home.

 This is news. I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp. 

 My dear girl! --he flung out his hand-- have you eyes? have you a skin?
How could it be anything but damp in such a situation? In the first
place, the Grange is on clay, and built where the castle moat must have
been; then there s that detestable little river, steaming all night like
a kettle. Feel the cellar walls; look up under the eaves. Ask Sir James
or any one. Those Shropshire valleys are notorious. The only possible
place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill; but, for my part, I think
the country is too far from London, and the scenery nothing special. 

Margaret could not resist saying,  Why did you go there, then? 

 I--because--  He drew his head back and grew rather angry.  Why have
we come to the Tyrol, if it comes to that? One might go on asking such
questions indefinitely. 

One might; but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer. Out it
came, and he believed it as soon as it was spoken.

 The truth is, I took Oniton on account of Evie. Don t let this go any
further. 

 Certainly not. 

 I shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad
bargain. No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged. Poor
little girl! She was so keen on it all, and wouldn t even wait to
make proper inquiries about the shooting. Afraid it would get snapped
up--just like all of your sex. Well, no harm s done. She has had her
country wedding, and I ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are
starting a preparatory school. 

 Where shall we live, then, Henry? I should enjoy living somewhere. 

 I have not yet decided. What about Norfolk? 

Margaret was silent. Marriage had not saved her from the sense of
flux. London was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilisation which is
altering human nature so profoundly, and throws upon personal
relations a stress greater than they have ever borne before. Under
cosmopolitanism, if it comes, we shall receive no help from the earth.
Trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle, and the
binding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to
Love alone. May Love be equal to the task!

 It is now what?  continued Henry.  Nearly October. Let us camp for the
winter at Ducie Street, and look out for something in the spring. 

 If possible, something permanent. I can t be as young as I was, for
these alterations don t suit me. 

 But, my dear, which would you rather have--alterations or rheumatism? 

 I see your point,  said Margaret, getting up.  If Oniton is really
damp, it is impossible, and must be inhabited by little boys. Only, in
the spring, let us look before we leap. I will take warning by Evie,
and not hurry you. Remember that you have a free hand this time.
These endless moves must be bad for the furniture, and are certainly
expensive. 

 What a practical little woman it is! What s it been reading?
Theo--theo--how much? 

 Theosophy. 

So Ducie Street was her first fate--a pleasant enough fate. The house,
being only a little larger than Wickham Place, trained her for the
immense establishment that was promised in the spring. They were
frequently away, but at home life ran fairly regularly. In the
morning Henry went to business, and his sandwich--a relic this of some
prehistoric craving--was always cut by her own hand. He did not rely
upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew
hungry at eleven. When he had gone, there was the house to look after,
and the servants to humanise, and several kettles of Helen s to keep on
the boil. Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts; she
was not sorry to have lost sight of them. No doubt Leonard was worth
helping, but being Henry s wife, she preferred to help some one else. As
for theatres and discussion societies, they attracted her less and
less. She began to  miss  new movements, and to spend her spare time
re-reading or thinking, rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends.
They attributed the change to her marriage, and perhaps some deep
instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than
was inevitable. Yet the main cause lay deeper still; she had outgrown
stimulants, and was passing from words to things. It was doubtless a
pity not to keep up with Wedekind or John, but some closing of the gates
is inevitable after thirty, if the mind itself is to become a creative
power.

31,31,6588,6650,6712,"

She was looking at plans one day in the following spring--they had
finally decided to go down into Sussex and build--when Mrs. Charles
Wilcox was announced.

 Have you heard the news?  Dolly cried, as soon as she entered the room.
 Charles is so ang--I mean he is sure you know about it, or, rather, that
you don t know. 

 Why, Dolly!  said Margaret, placidly kissing her.  Here s a surprise!
How are the boys and the baby? 

Boys and the baby were well, and in describing a great row that there
had been at the Hilton Tennis Club, Dolly forgot her news. The wrong
people had tried to get in. The rector, as representing the older
inhabitants, had said--Charles had said--the tax-collector had
said--Charles had regretted not saying--and she closed the description
with,  But lucky you, with four courts of your own at Midhurst. 

 It will be very jolly,  replied Margaret.

 Are those the plans? Does it matter my seeing them? 

 Of course not. 

 Charles has never seen the plans. 

 They have only just arrived. Here is the ground floor--no, that s
rather difficult. Try the elevation. We are to have a good many gables
and a picturesque sky-line. 

 What makes it smell so funny?  said Dolly, after a moment s inspection.
She was incapable of understanding plans or maps.

 I suppose the paper. 

 And WHICH way up is it? 

 Just the ordinary way up. That s the sky-line and the part that smells
strongest is the sky. 

 Well, ask me another. Margaret--oh--what was I going to say? How s
Helen? 

 Quite well. 

 Is she never coming back to England? Every one thinks it s awfully odd
she doesn t. 

 So it is,  said Margaret, trying to conceal her vexation. She was
getting rather sore on this point.  Helen is odd, awfully. She has now
been away eight months. 

 But hasn t she any address? 

 A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address. Do write her a
line. I will look it up for you. 

 No, don t bother. That s eight months she has been away, surely? 

 Exactly. She left just after Evie s wedding. It would be eight months. 

 Just when baby was born, then? 

 Just so. 

Dolly sighed, and stared enviously round the drawing-room. She was
beginning to lose her brightness and good looks. The Charles s were not
well off, for Mr. Wilcox, having brought up his children with expensive
tastes, believed in letting them shift for themselves. After all, he
had not treated them generously. Yet another baby was expected, she
told Margaret, and they would have to give up the motor. Margaret
sympathised, but in a formal fashion, and Dolly little imagined that the
stepmother was urging Mr. Wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance.
She sighed again, and at last the particular grievance was remembered.
 Oh, yes,  she cried,  that is it: Miss Avery has been unpacking your
packing-cases. 

 Why has she done that? How unnecessary! 

 Ask another. I suppose you ordered her to. 

 I gave no such orders. Perhaps she was airing the things. She did
undertake to light an occasional fire. 

 It was far more than an air,  said Dolly solemnly.  The floor sounds
covered with books. Charles sent me to know what is to be done, for he
feels certain you don t know. 

 Books!  cried Margaret, moved by the holy word.  Dolly, are you
serious? Has she been touching our books? 

 Hasn t she, though! What used to be the hall s full of them. Charles
thought for certain you knew of it. 

 I am very much obliged to you, Dolly. What can have come over Miss
Avery? I must go down about it at once. Some of the books are my
brother s, and are quite valuable. She had no right to open any of the
cases. 

 I say she s dotty. She was the one that never got married, you know.
Oh, I say, perhaps, she thinks your books are wedding-presents to
herself. Old maids are taken that way sometimes. Miss Avery hates us all
like poison ever since her frightful dust-up with Evie. 

 I hadn t heard of that,  said Margaret. A visit from Dolly had its
compensations.

 Didn t you know she gave Evie a present last August, and Evie returned
it, and then--oh, goloshes! You never read such a letter as Miss Avery
wrote. 

 But it was wrong of Evie to return it. It wasn t like her to do such a
heartless thing. 

 But the present was so expensive. 

 Why does that make any difference, Dolly? 

 Still, when it costs over five pounds--I didn t see it, but it was
a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop. You can t very well
accept that kind of thing from a farm woman. Now, can you? 

 You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married. 

 Oh, mine was old earthenware stuff--not worth a halfpenny. Evie s was
quite different. You d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you
a pendant like that. Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all
said it was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a girl to
do? Evie didn t want to upset the old thing, so thought a sort of joking
letter best, and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save Miss
Avery trouble. 

 But Miss Avery said-- 

Dolly s eyes grew round.  It was a perfectly awful letter. Charles said
it was the letter of a madman. In the end she had the pendant back again
from the shop and threw it into the duck-pond. 

 Did she give any reasons? 

 We think she meant to be invited to Oniton, and so climb into society. 

 She s rather old for that,  said Margaret pensively.  May she not have
given the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother? 

 That s a notion. Give every one their due, eh? Well, I suppose I ought
to be toddling. Come along, Mr. Muff--you want a new coat, but I don t
know who ll give it you, I m sure;  and addressing her apparel with
mournful humour, Dolly moved from the room.

Margaret followed her to ask whether Henry knew about Miss Avery s
rudeness.

 Oh yes. 

 I wonder, then, why he let me ask her to look after the house. 

 But she s only a farm woman,  said Dolly, and her explanation proved
correct. Henry only censured the lower classes when it suited him. He
bore with Miss Avery as with Crane--because he could get good value out
of them.  I have patience with a man who knows his job,  he would say,
really having patience with the job, and not the man. Paradoxical as it
may sound, he had something of the artist about him; he would pass over
an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his
wife.

Margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble herself. Parties
were evidently ruffled. With Henry s permission, she wrote a pleasant
note to Miss Avery, asking her to leave the cases untouched. Then, at
the first convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to
repack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse;
the plan had been amateurish and a failure. Tibby promised to accompany
her, but at the last moment begged to be excused. So, for the second
time in her life, she entered the house alone.

unpacking your packing cases     why has she done that  how unnecessary     ask another  i suppose you ordered her to     i gave no such orders  perhaps she was airing the things  she did undertake to

that way sometimes  miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie     i hadn t heard of that   said margaret  a visit from dolly had its compensations    didn t you know she gave evie a present last august  and evie returned it  and then  oh  goloshes  you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote     but it was wrong of evie to return it  it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing     but the present was so expensive     why does that make any difference  dolly     still  when it costs over five pounds  i didn t see it  but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop  you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman  now  can you     you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married     oh  mine was old earthenware stuff  not worth a halfpenny  evie s was quite different  you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that  uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible  and when four men agree  what is a girl to do  evie didn t want to upset the old thing  so thought a sort of joking letter best  and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble     but miss avery said     dolly s eyes grew round   it was a perfectly awful letter  charles said it was the letter of a madman  in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond     did she give any reasons     we think she meant to be invited to oniton  and so climb into society     she s rather old for that   said margaret pensively   may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother     that s a notion  give every one their due  eh  well  i suppose i ought to be toddling  come along  mr  muff  you

The day of her visit was exquisite, and the last of unclouded happiness
that she was to have for many months. Her anxiety about Helen s
extraordinary absence was still dormant, and as for a possible brush
with Miss Avery--that only gave zest to the expedition. She had also
eluded Dolly s invitation to luncheon. Walking straight up from the
station, she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut
avenue that connects it with the church. The church itself stood in the
village once. But it there attracted so many worshippers that the
devil, in a pet, snatched it from its foundations, and poised it on
an inconvenient knoll, three quarters of a mile away. If this story is
true, the chestnut avenue must have been planted by the angels. No more
tempting approach could be imagined for the lukewarm Christian, and if
he still finds the walk too long, the devil is defeated all the same,
Science having built Holy Trinity, a Chapel of Ease, near the Charles s
and roofed it with tin.

Up the avenue Margaret strolled slowly, stopping to watch the sky that
gleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts, or to finger the
little horseshoes on the lower branches. Why has not England a great
mythology? Our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness, and the
greater melodies about our country-side have all issued through the
pipes of Greece. Deep and true as the native imagination can be, it
seems to have failed here. It has stopped with the witches and the
fairies. It cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field, or give names
to half a dozen stars. England still waits for the supreme moment of her
literature--for the great poet who shall voice her, or, better still for
the thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk.

At the church the scenery changed. The chestnut avenue opened into
a road, smooth but narrow, which led into the untouched country. She
followed it for over a mile. Its little hesitations pleased her. Having
no urgent destiny, it strolled downhill or up as it wished, taking
no trouble about the gradients, or about the view, which nevertheless
expanded. The great estates that throttle the south of Hertfordshire
were less obtrusive here, and the appearance of the land was neither
aristocratic nor suburban. To define it was difficult, but Margaret knew
what it was not: it was not snobbish. Though its contours were slight,
there was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which Surrey will never
attain, and the distant brow of the Chilterns towered like a mountain.
 Left to itself,  was Margaret s opinion,  this county would vote
Liberal.  The comradeship, not passionate, that is our highest gift as
a nation, was promised by it, as by the low brick farm where she called
for the key.

But the inside of the farm was disappointing. A most finished young
person received her.  Yes, Mrs. Wilcox; no, Mrs. Wilcox; oh yes, Mrs.
Wilcox, auntie received your letter quite duly. Auntie has gone up to
your little place at the present moment. Shall I send the servant to
direct you?  Followed by:  Of course, auntie does not generally look
after your place; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something
exceptional. It gives her something to do. She spends quite a lot of her
time there. My husband says to me sometimes,  Where s auntie?  I say,
 Need you ask? She s at Howards End.  Yes, Mrs. Wilcox. Mrs. Wilcox,
could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake? Not if I cut it for
you? 

Margaret refused the cake, but unfortunately this gave her gentility in
the eyes of Miss Avery s niece.

 I cannot let you go on alone. Now don t. You really mustn t. I
will direct you myself if it comes to that. I must get my hat.
Now --roguishly-- Mrs. Wilcox, don t you move while I m gone. 

Stunned, Margaret did not move from the best parlour, over which the
touch of art nouveau had fallen. But the other rooms looked in keeping,
though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior. Here had
lived an elder race, to which we look back with disquietude. The country
which we visit at week-ends was really a home to it, and the graver
sides of life, the deaths, the partings, the yearnings for love,
have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields. All was not
sadness. The sun was shining without. The thrush sang his two syllables
on the budding guelder-rose. Some children were playing uproariously
in heaps of golden straw. It was the presence of sadness at all that
surprised Margaret, and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness.
In these English farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily and see
it whole, group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth,
connect--connect without bitterness until all men are brothers. But her
thoughts were interrupted by the return of Miss Avery s niece, and were
so tranquillising that she suffered the interruption gladly.

It was quicker to go out by the back door, and, after due explanations,
they went out by it. The niece was now mortified by innumerable
chickens, who rushed up to her feet for food, and by a shameless and
maternal sow. She did not know what animals were coming to. But her
gentility withered at the touch of the sweet air. The wind was rising,
scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated
in families over Evie s pendant. One of those delicious gales of spring,
in which leaves still in bud seem to rustle, swept over the land and
then fell silent.  Georgie,  sang the thrush.  Cuckoo,  came furtively
from the cliff of pine-trees.  Georgie, pretty Georgie,  and the other
birds joined in with nonsense. The hedge was a half-painted picture
which would be finished in a few days. Celandines grew on its banks,
lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows; the wild
rose-bushes, still bearing their withered hips, showed also the promise
of blossom. Spring had come, clad in no classical garb, yet fairer
than all springs; fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of
Tuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind.

The two women walked up the lane full of outward civility. But Margaret
was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such
a day, and the niece was thinking about hats. Thus engaged, they reached
Howards End. Petulant cries of  Auntie!  severed the air. There was no
reply, and the front door was locked.

 Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here?  asked Margaret.

 Oh, yes, Mrs. Wilcox, quite sure. She is here daily. 

Margaret tried to look in through the dining-room window, but the
curtain inside was drawn tightly. So with the drawing-room and the hall.
The appearance of these curtains was familiar, yet she did not remember
their being there on her other visit; her impression was that Mr. Bryce
had taken everything away. They tried the back. Here again they received
no answer, and could see nothing; the kitchen-window was fitted with
a blind, while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up
against them, which looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases.
Margaret thought of her books, and she lifted up her voice also. At the
first cry she succeeded.

 Well, well!  replied some one inside the house.  If it isn t Mrs.
Wilcox come at last! 

 Have you got the key, auntie? 

 Madge, go away,  said Miss Avery, still invisible.

 Auntie, it s Mrs. Wilcox-- 

Margaret supported her.  Your niece and I have come together. 

 Madge, go away. This is no moment for your hat. 

The poor woman went red.  Auntie gets more eccentric lately,  she said
nervously.

 Miss Avery!  called Margaret.  I have come about the furniture. Could
you kindly let me in? 

 Yes, Mrs. Wilcox,  said the voice,  of course.  But after that came
silence. They called again without response. They walked round the house
disconsolately.

 I hope Miss Avery is not ill,  hazarded Margaret.

 Well, if you ll excuse me,  said Madge,  perhaps I ought to be leaving
you now. The servants need seeing to at the farm. Auntie is so odd at
times.  Gathering up her elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if
her departure had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.

Miss Avery said,  Well, come right in, Mrs. Wilcox!  quite pleasantly
and calmly.

 Thank you so much,  began Margaret, but broke off at the sight of an
umbrella-stand. It was her own.

 Come right into the hall first,  said Miss Avery. She drew the curtain,
and Margaret uttered a cry of despair. For an appalling thing had
happened. The hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from
Wickham Place. The carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up
near the window; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace,
and her father s sword--this is what bewildered her particularly--had
been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes.
Miss Avery must have worked for days.

 I m afraid this isn t what we meant,  she began.  Mr. Wilcox and I
never intended the cases to be touched. For instance, these books are my
brother s. We are storing them for him and for my sister, who is abroad.
When you kindly undertook to look after things, we never expected you to
do so much. 

 The house has been empty long enough,  said the old woman.

Margaret refused to argue.  I dare say we didn t explain,  she said
civilly.  It has been a mistake, and very likely our mistake. 

 Mrs. Wilcox, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years. The
house is Mrs. Wilcox s, and she would not desire it to stand empty any
longer. 

To help the poor decaying brain, Margaret said:

 Yes, Mrs. Wilcox s house, the mother of Mr. Charles. 

 Mistake upon mistake,  said Miss Avery.  Mistake upon mistake. 

 Well, I don t know,  said Margaret, sitting down in one of her own
chairs.  I really don t know what s to be done.  She could not help
laughing.

The other said:  Yes, it should be a merry house enough. 

 I don t know--I dare say. Well, thank you very much, Miss Avery. Yes,
that s all right. Delightful. 

 There is still the parlour.  She went through the door opposite and
drew a curtain. Light flooded the drawing-room furniture from Wickham
Place.  And the dining-room.  More curtains were drawn, more windows
were flung open to the spring.  Then through here--  Miss Avery
continued passing and reprising through the hall. Her voice was lost,
but Margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind.  I ve not finished
here yet,  she announced, returning.  There s still a deal to do. The
farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no need
to go into expense at Hilton. 

 It is all a mistake,  repeated Margaret, feeling that she must put her
foot down.  A misunderstanding. Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live
at Howards End. 

 Oh, indeed! On account of his hay fever? 

 We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex, and part
of this furniture--my part--will go down there presently.  She looked at
Miss Avery intently, trying to understand the kink in her brain.

Here was no maundering old woman. Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous.
She looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious
nobility.  You think that you won t come back to live here, Mrs. Wilcox,
but you will. 

 That remains to be seen,  said Margaret, smiling.  We have no intention
of doing so for the present. We happen to need a much larger house.
Circumstances oblige us to give big parties. Of course, some day--one
never knows, does one? 

Miss Avery retorted:  Some day! Tcha! tcha! Don t talk about some day.
You are living here now. 

 Am I? 

 You are living here, and have been for the last ten minutes, if you ask
me. 

It was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of disloyalty
Margaret rose from her chair. She felt that Henry had been obscurely
censured. They went into the dining-room, where the sunlight poured in
upon her mother s chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped
from a new niche. The furniture fitted extraordinarily well. In the
central room--over the hall, the room that Helen had slept in four years
ago--Miss Avery had placed Tibby s old bassinette.

 The nursery,  she said.

Margaret turned away without speaking.

At last everything was seen. The kitchen and lobby were still stacked
with furniture and straw, but, as far as she could make out, nothing
had been broken or scratched. A pathetic display of ingenuity! Then they
took a friendly stroll in the garden. It had gone wild since her last
visit. The gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up at the very
jaws of the garage. And Evie s rockery was only bumps. Perhaps Evie was
responsible for Miss Avery s oddness. But Margaret suspected that the
cause lay deeper, and that the girl s silly letter had but loosed the
irritation of years.

 It s a beautiful meadow,  she remarked. It was one of those open-air
drawing-rooms that have been formed, hundreds of years ago, out of the
smaller fields. So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right
angles, and at the bottom there was a little green annex--a sort of
powder-closet for the cows.

 Yes, the maidy s well enough,  said Miss Avery,  for those, that is,
who don t suffer from sneezing.  And she cackled maliciously.  I ve
seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time--oh, they ought to do
this--they mustn t do that--he d learn them to be lads. And just then
the tickling took him. He has it from his father, with other things.
There s not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June--I
laughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth. 

 My brother gets hay fever too,  said Margaret.

 This house lies too much on the land for them. Naturally, they were
glad enough to slip in at first. But Wilcoxes are better than nothing,
as I see you ve found. 

Margaret laughed.

 They keep a place going, don t they? Yes, it is just that. 

 They keep England going, it is my opinion. 

But Miss Avery upset her by replying:  Ay, they breed like rabbits.
Well, well, it s a funny world. But He who made it knows what He wants
in it, I suppose. If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth, it isn t for
us to repine. 

 They breed and they also work,  said Margaret, conscious of some
invitation to disloyalty, which was echoed by the very breeze and by the
songs of the birds.  It certainly is a funny world, but so long as men
like my husband and his sons govern it, I think it ll never be a bad
one--never really bad. 

 No, better n nothing,  said Miss Avery, and turned to the wych-elm.

On their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more
clearly than before. In the house Margaret had wondered whether she
quite distinguished the first wife from the second. Now she said:  I
never saw much of Ruth after her grandmother died, but we stayed civil.
It was a very civil family. Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against
anybody, nor let any one be turned away without food. Then it was never
 Trespassers will be prosecuted  in their land, but would people please
not come in? Mrs. Howard was never created to run a farm. 

 Had they no men to help them?  Margaret asked.

Miss Avery replied:  Things went on until there were no men. 

 Until Mr. Wilcox came along,  corrected Margaret, anxious that her
husband should receive his dues.

 I suppose so; but Ruth should have married a--no disrespect to you to
say this, for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way, whether
she got him first or no. 

 Whom should she have married? 

 A soldier!  exclaimed the old woman.  Some real soldier. 

Margaret was silent. It was a criticism of Henry s character far more
trenchant than any of her own. She felt dissatisfied.

 But that s all over,  she went on.  A better time is coming now, though
you ve kept me long enough waiting. In a couple of weeks I ll see your
light shining through the hedge of an evening. Have you ordered in
coals? 

 We are not coming,  said Margaret firmly. She respected Miss Avery too
much to humour her.  No. Not coming. Never coming. It has all been a
mistake. The furniture must be repacked at once, and I am very sorry,
but I am making other arrangements, and must ask you to give me the
keys. 

 Certainly, Mrs. Wilcox,  said Miss Avery, and resigned her duties with
a smile.

Relieved at this conclusion, and having sent her compliments to Madge,
Margaret walked back to the station. She had intended to go to the
furniture warehouse and give directions for removal, but the muddle had
turned out more extensive than she expected, so she decided to consult
Henry. It was as well that she did this. He was strongly against
employing the local man whom he had previously recommended, and advised
her to store in London after all.

But before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her.

air  there was no reply  and the front door was locked    are you sure that miss avery is up here   asked margaret    oh  yes  mrs  wilcox  quite sure  she is here daily    margaret tried to look in through the dining room window  but the curtain inside was drawn tightly  so with the drawing room and the hall  the appearance of these curtains was familiar  yet she did not remember their being there on her other visit  her impression was that mr  bryce had taken everything away  they tried the back  here again they received no answer  and could see nothing  the kitchen window was fitted with a blind  while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them  which looked ominously like the lids of packing cases  margaret thought of her books  and she lifted up her voice also  at the first cry she succeeded    well  well   replied some one inside the house   if it isn t mrs  wilcox come at last     have you got the key  auntie     madge  go away   said miss avery  still invisible    auntie  it s mrs  wilcox     margaret supported her   your niece and i have come together     madge  go away  this is no moment for your hat    the poor woman went red   auntie gets more eccentric lately   she said nervously    miss avery   called margaret   i have come about the furniture  could you kindly let me in     yes  mrs  wilcox   said the voice   of course   but after that came silence  they called again without response  they walked round the house disconsolately    i hope miss avery is not ill   hazarded margaret    well  if you ll excuse me   said madge   perhaps i ought to be leaving you now  the servants need seeing to at the farm  auntie is so odd at times   gathering up her elegancies  she retired defeated  and  as if her departure had loosed a spring  the front door opened at once   miss avery said   well  come right in  mrs  wilcox   quite pleasantly and calmly    thank you so much   began margaret  but broke off at the sight of an umbrella stand  it was her own    come right into the hall first   said miss avery  she drew the curtain  and margaret uttered a cry of despair  for an appalling thing had happened  the hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from wickham place  the carpet had been laid  the big work table drawn up near the window  the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace  and her father s sword  this is what bewildered her particularly  had been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes  miss avery must have worked for days    i m afraid this isn t what we meant   she began   mr  wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched  for instance  these books are my brother s  we are storing them for him and for my sister  who is abroad  when you kindly undertook to look after things  we never expected you to do so much     the house has been empty long enough   said the old woman   margaret refused to argue   i dare say we didn t explain   she said civilly   it has been a mistake  and very likely our mistake     mrs  wilcox  it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years  the house is mrs  wilcox s  and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer    to help the poor decaying brain  margaret said    yes  mrs  wilcox s house  the mother of mr  charles     mistake upon mistake   said miss avery   mistake upon mistake     well  i don t know   said margaret  sitting down in one of her own chairs   i really don t know what s to be done   she could not help laughing   the other said   yes  it should be a merry house enough     i don t know  i dare say  well  thank you very much  miss avery  yes  that s all right  delightful     there is still the parlour   she went through the door opposite and drew a curtain  light flooded the drawing room furniture from wickham place   and the dining room   more curtains were drawn  more windows were flung open to the spring   then through here    miss avery continued passing and reprising through the hall  her voice was lost  but margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind   i ve not finished here yet   she announced  returning   there s still a deal to do  the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs  for there is no need to go into expense at hilton     it is all a mistake   repeated margaret  feeling that she must put her foot down   a misunderstanding  mr  wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end     oh  indeed  on account of his hay fever     we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex  and part of this furniture  my part  will go down there presently   she looked at miss avery intently  trying to understand the kink in her brain   here was no maundering old woman  her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous  she looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious nobility   you think that you won t come back to live here  mrs  wilcox  but you will     that remains to be seen   said margaret  smiling   we have no intention of doing so for the present  we happen to need a much larger house  circumstances oblige us to give big parties  of course  some day  one never knows  does one    miss avery retorted   some day  tcha  tcha  don t talk about some day  you are living here now     am i     you are living here  and have been for the last ten minutes  if you ask me    it was a senseless remark  but with a queer feeling of disloyalty margaret rose from her chair  she felt that henry had been obscurely censured  they went into the dining room  where the sunlight poured in upon her mother s chiffonier  and upstairs  where many an old god peeped from a new niche  the furniture fitted extraordinarily well  in the central room  over the hall  the room that helen had slept in four years ago  miss avery had placed tibby s old bassinette    the nursery   she said   margaret turned away without speaking   at last everything was seen  the kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw  but  as far as she could make out  nothing had been broken or scratched  a pathetic display of ingenuity  then they took a friendly stroll in the garden  it had gone wild since her last visit  the gravel sweep was weedy  and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage  and evie s rockery was only bumps  perhaps evie was responsible for miss avery s oddness  but margaret suspected that the because lay deeper  and that the girl s silly letter had but loosed the irritation of years    it s a beautiful meadow   she remarked  it was one of those open air drawing rooms that have been formed  hundreds of years ago  out of the smaller fields  so the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles  and at the bottom there was a little green annex  a sort of powder closet for the cows    yes  the maidy s well enough   said miss avery   for those  that is  who don t suffer from sneezing   and she cackled maliciously   i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time  oh  they ought to do this  they mustn t do that  he d learn them to be lads  and just then the tickling took him  he has it from his father  with other things  there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june  i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth     my brother gets hay fever too   said margaret    this house lies too much on the land for them  naturally  they were glad enough to slip in at first  but wilcoxes are better than nothing  as i see you ve found    margaret laughed    they keep a place going  don t they  yes  it is just that     they keep england going  it is my opinion    but miss avery upset her by replying   ay  they breed like rabbits  well  well  it s a funny world  but he who made it knows what he wants in it  i suppose  if mrs  charlie is expecting her fourth  it isn t for us to repine     they breed and they also work   said margaret  conscious of some invitation to disloyalty  which was echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds   it certainly is a funny world  but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it  i think it ll never be a bad one  never really bad     no  better n nothing   said miss avery  and turned to the wych elm   on their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more clearly than before  in the house margaret had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife from the second  now she said   i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died  but we stayed civil  it was a very civil family  old mrs  howard never spoke against anybody  nor let any one be turned away without food  then it was never  trespassers will be prosecuted  in their land  but would people please not come in  mrs  howard was never created to run a farm     had they no men to help them   margaret asked   miss avery replied   things went on until there were no men     until mr  wilcox came along   corrected margaret  anxious that her husband should receive his dues    i suppose so  but ruth should have married a  no disrespect to you to say this  for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way  whether she got him first or no     whom should she have married     a soldier   exclaimed the old woman   some real soldier    margaret was silent  it was a criticism of henry s character far more trenchant than any of her own  she felt dissatisfied    but that s all over   she went on   a better time is coming now  though you ve kept me long enough waiting  in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening  have you ordered in coals     we are not coming   said margaret firmly  she respected miss avery too much to humour her   no  not coming  never coming  it has all been a mistake  the furniture must be repacked at once  and i am very sorry  but i am making other arrangements  and must ask you to give me the keys     certainly  mrs  wilcox   said miss avery  and resigned her duties with a smile   relieved at this conclusion  and having sent her compliments to madge  margaret walked back to the station  she had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal  but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected  so she decided to consult henry  it was as well that she did this  he was strongly against employing the local man whom he had previously recommended  and advised her to store in london after all   but before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon

It was not unexpected entirely. Aunt Juley s health had been bad all
winter. She had had a long series of colds and coughs, and had been too
busy to get rid of them. She had scarcely promised her niece  to really
take my tiresome chest in hand,  when she caught a chill and developed
acute pneumonia. Margaret and Tibby went down to Swanage. Helen was
telegraphed for, and that spring party that after all gathered in that
hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories. On a perfect day,
when the sky seemed blue porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little
bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, Margaret hurried up through
the rhododendrons, confronted again by the senselessness of Death.
One death may explain itself, but it throws no light upon another; the
groping inquiry must begin anew. Preachers or scientists may generalise,
but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love; not
one heaven awaits them, not even one oblivion. Aunt Juley, incapable of
tragedy, slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for
having stopped in it so long. She was very weak; she could not rise to
the occasion, or realise the great mystery which all agree must await
her; it only seemed to her that she was quite done up--more done up
than ever before; that she saw and heard and felt less every moment; and
that, unless something changed, she would soon feel nothing. Her spare
strength she devoted to plans: could not Margaret take some steamer
expeditions? were mackerel cooked as Tibby liked them? She worried
herself about Helen s absence, and also that she should be the cause of
Helen s return. The nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural,
and perhaps hers was an average approach to the Great Gate. But Margaret
saw Death stripped of any false romance; whatever the idea of Death may
contain, the process can be trivial and hideous.

 Important--Margaret dear, take the Lulworth when Helen comes. 

 Helen won t be able to stop, Aunt Juley. She has telegraphed that she
can only get away just to see you. She must go back to Germany as soon
as you are well. 

 How very odd of Helen! Mr. Wilcox-- 

 Yes, dear? 

 Can he spare you? 

Henry wished her to come, and had been very kind. Yet again Margaret
said so.

Mrs. Munt did not die. Quite outside her will, a more dignified power
took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope. She returned,
without emotion, as fidgety as ever. On the fourth day she was out of
danger.

 Margaret--important,  it went on:  I should like you to have some
companion to take walks with. Do try Miss Conder. 

 I have been for a little walk with Miss Conder. 

 But she is not really interesting. If only you had Helen. 

 I have Tibby, Aunt Juley. 

 No, but he has to do his Chinese. Some real companion is what you need.
Really, Helen is odd. 

 Helen is odd, very,  agreed Margaret.

 Not content with going abroad, why does she want to go back there at
once? 

 No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us. She has not the
least balance. 

That was the stock criticism about Helen, but Margaret s voice trembled
as she made it. By now she was deeply pained at her sister s behaviour.
It may be unbalanced to fly out of England, but to stay away eight
months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head. A sick-bed
could recall Helen, but she was deaf to more human calls; after a
glimpse at her aunt, she would retire into her nebulous life behind some
poste restante. She scarcely existed; her letters had become dull and
infrequent; she had no wants and no curiosity. And it was all put down
to poor Henry s account! Henry, long pardoned by his wife, was still too
infamous to be greeted by his sister-in-law. It was morbid, and, to her
alarm, Margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity
back in Helen s life for nearly four years. The flight from Oniton;
the unbalanced patronage of the Basts; the explosion of grief up on
the Downs--all connected with Paul, an insignificant boy whose lips had
kissed hers for a fraction of time. Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox had feared
that they might kiss again. Foolishly--the real danger was reaction.
Reaction against the Wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was
scarcely sane. At twenty-five she had an idee fixe. What hope was there
for her as an old woman?

The more Margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became. For many
months she had put the subject away, but it was too big to be slighted
now. There was almost a taint of madness. Were all Helen s actions to be
governed by a tiny mishap, such as may happen to any young man or
woman? Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant? The
blundering little encounter at Howards End was vital. It propagated
itself where graver intercourse lay barren; it was stronger than
sisterly intimacy, stronger than reason or books. In one of her moods
Helen had confessed that she still  enjoyed  it in a certain sense.
Paul had faded, but the magic of his caress endured. And where there is
enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction--propagation at both
ends.

Well, it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed-beds, and
we without power to choose the seed. But man is an odd, sad creature as
yet, intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within
himself. He cannot be bored about psychology. He leaves it to the
specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a
steam-engine. He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul. Margaret
and Helen have been more patient, and it is suggested that Margaret
has succeeded--so far as success is yet possible. She does understand
herself, she has some rudimentary control over her own growth. Whether
Helen has succeeded one cannot say.

The day that Mrs. Munt rallied Helen s letter arrived. She had posted
it at Munich, and would be in London herself on the morrow. It was a
disquieting letter, though the opening was affectionate and sane.

 DEAREST MEG,

 Give Helen s love to Aunt Juley. Tell her that I love, and have loved
her ever since I can remember. I shall be in London Thursday.

 My address will be care of the bankers. I have not yet settled on a
hotel, so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news. If Aunt
Juley is much better, or if, for a terrible reason, it would be no good
my coming down to Swanage, you must not think it odd if I do not come.
I have all sorts of plans in my head. I am living abroad at present, and
want to get back as quickly as possible. Will you please tell me where
our furniture is? I should like to take out one or two books; the rest
are for you.

 Forgive me, dearest Meg. This must read like rather a tiresome letter,
but all letters are from your loving

 HELEN. 

It was a tiresome letter, for it tempted Margaret to tell a lie. If
she wrote that Aunt Juley was still in danger her sister would come.
Unhealthiness is contagious. We cannot be in contact with those who are
in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating. To  act for the best 
 might do Helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the risk of
disaster, she kept her colours flying a little longer. She replied that
their aunt was much better, and awaited developments.

Tibby approved of her reply. Mellowing rapidly, he was a pleasanter
companion than before. Oxford had done much for him. He had lost his
peevishness, and could hide his indifference to people and his interest
in food. But he had not grown more human. The years between eighteen and
twenty-two, so magical for most, were leading him gently from boyhood to
middle age. He had never known young-manliness, that quality which warms
the heart till death, and gives Mr. Wilcox an imperishable charm. He
was frigid, through no fault of his own, and without cruelty. He thought
Helen wrong and Margaret right, but the family trouble was for him what
a scene behind footlights is for most people. He had only one suggestion
to make, and that was characteristic.

 Why don t you tell Mr. Wilcox? 

 About Helen? 

 Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing. 

 He would do all he could, but-- 

 Oh, you know best. But he is practical. 

It was the student s belief in experts. Margaret demurred for one or two
reasons. Presently Helen s answer came. She sent a telegram requesting
the address of the furniture, as she would now return at once. Margaret
replied,  Certainly not; meet me at the bankers  at four.  She and Tibby
went up to London. Helen was not at the bankers , and they were refused
her address. Helen had passed into chaos.

Margaret put her arm round her brother. He was all that she had left,
and never had he seemed more unsubstantial.

 Tibby love, what next? 

He replied:  It is extraordinary. 

 Dear, your judgment s often clearer than mine. Have you any notion
what s at the back? 

 None, unless it s something mental. 

 Oh--that!  said Margaret.  Quite impossible.  But the suggestion had
been uttered, and in a few minutes she took it up herself. Nothing else
explained. And London agreed with Tibby. The mask fell off the city, and
she saw it for what it really is--a caricature of infinity. The familiar
barriers, the streets along which she moved, the houses between which
she had made her little journeys for so many years, became negligible
suddenly. Helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the
slowly-flowing slabs of mud. She had accomplished a hideous act of
renunciation and returned to the One. Margaret s own faith held firm.
She knew the human soul will be merged, if it be merged at all, with the
stars and the sea. Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for
many years. It was symbolic the catastrophe should come now, on a London
afternoon, while rain fell slowly.

Henry was the only hope. Henry was definite. He might know of some paths
in the chaos that were hidden from them, and she determined to take
Tibby s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands. They must call at
his office. He could not well make it worse. She went for a few moments
into St. Paul s, whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely, as
if preaching the gospel of form. But within, St. Paul s is as its
surroundings--echoes and whispers, inaudible songs, invisible mosaics,
wet footmarks, crossing and recrossing the floor. Si monumentum
requiris, circumspice; it points us back to London. There was no hope of
Helen here.

Henry was unsatisfactory at first. That she had expected. He was
overjoyed to see her back from Swanage, and slow to admit the growth of
a new trouble. When they told him of their search, he only chaffed Tibby
and the Schlegels generally, and declared that it was  just like Helen 
 to lead her relatives a dance.

 That is what we all say,  replied Margaret.  But why should it be
just like Helen? Why should she be allowed to be so queer, and to grow
queerer? 

 Don t ask me. I m a plain man of business. I live and let live. My
advice to you both is, don t worry. Margaret, you ve got black marks
again under your eyes. You know that s strictly forbidden. First
your aunt--then your sister. No, we aren t going to have it. Are we,
Theobald?  He rang the bell.  I ll give you some tea, and then you go
straight to Ducie Street. I can t have my girl looking as old as her
husband. 

 All the same, you have not quite seen our point,  said Tibby.

Mr. Wilcox, who was in good spirits, retorted,  I don t suppose I ever
shall.  He leant back, laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family,
while the fire flickered over the map of Africa. Margaret motioned to
her brother to go on. Rather diffident, he obeyed her.

 Margaret s point is this,  he said.  Our sister may be mad. 

Charles, who was working in the inner room, looked round.

 Come in, Charles,  said Margaret kindly.  Could you help us at all? We
are again in trouble. 

 I m afraid I cannot. What are the facts? We are all mad more or less,
you know, in these days. 

 The facts are as follows,  replied Tibby, who had at times a pedantic
lucidity.  The facts are that she has been in England for three days and
will not see us. She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address.
She refuses to answer questions. Margaret finds her letters colourless.
There are other facts, but these are the most striking. 

 She has never behaved like this before, then?  asked Henry.

 Of course not!  said his wife, with a frown.

 Well, my dear, how am I to know? 

A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her.  You know quite well that
Helen never sins against affection,  she said.  You must have noticed
that much in her, surely. 

 Oh yes; she and I have always hit it off together. 

 No, Henry--can t you see?--I don t mean that. 

She recovered herself, but not before Charles had observed her. Stupid
and attentive, he was watching the scene.

 I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past, one could trace
it back to the heart in the long-run. She behaved oddly because she
cared for some one, or wanted to help them. There s no possible excuse
for her now. She is grieving us deeply, and that is why I am sure that
she is not well.  Mad  is too terrible a word, but she is not well.
I shall never believe it. I shouldn t discuss my sister with you if I
thought she was well--trouble you about her, I mean. 

Henry began to grow serious. Ill-health was to him something perfectly
definite. Generally well himself, he could not realise that we sink to
it by slow gradations. The sick had no rights; they were outside the
pale; one could lie to them remorselessly. When his first wife was
seized, he had promised to take her down into Hertfordshire, but
meanwhile arranged with a nursing-home instead. Helen, too, was ill. And
the plan that he sketched out for her capture, clever and well-meaning
as it was, drew its ethics from the wolf-pack.

 You want to get hold of her?  he said.  That s the problem, isn t it?
She has got to see a doctor. 

 For all I know she has seen one already. 

 Yes, yes; don t interrupt.  He rose to his feet and thought intently.
The genial, tentative host disappeared, and they saw instead the man who
had carved money out of Greece and Africa, and bought forests from the
natives for a few bottles of gin.  I ve got it,  he said at last.  It s
perfectly easy. Leave it to me. We ll send her down to Howards End. 

 How will you do that? 

 After her books. Tell her that she must unpack them herself. Then you
can meet her there. 

 But, Henry, that s just what she won t let me do. It s part of
her--whatever it is--never to see me. 

 Of course you won t tell her you re going. When she is there, looking
at the cases, you ll just stroll in. If nothing is wrong with her, so
much the better. But there ll be the motor round the corner, and we can
run her to a specialist in no time. 

Margaret shook her head.  It s quite impossible. 

 Why? 

 It doesn t seem impossible to me,  said Tibby;  it is surely a very
tippy plan. 

 It is impossible, because--  She looked at her husband sadly.  It s not
the particular language that Helen and I talk, if you see my meaning. It
would do splendidly for other people, whom I don t blame. 

 But Helen doesn t talk,  said Tibby.  That s our whole difficulty. She
won t talk your particular language, and on that account you think she s
ill. 

 No, Henry; it s sweet of you, but I couldn t. 

 I see,  he said;  you have scruples. 

 I suppose so. 

 And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer. You
could have got her down to Swanage by a word, but you had scruples. And
scruples are all very well. I am as scrupulous as any man alive, I hope;
but when it is a case like this, when there is a question of madness-- 

 I deny it s madness. 

 You said just now-- 

 It s madness when I say it, but not when you say it. 

Henry shrugged his shoulders.  Margaret! Margaret!  he groaned.  No
education can teach a woman logic. Now, my dear, my time is valuable. Do
you want me to help you or not? 

 Not in that way. 

 Answer my question. Plain question, plain answer. Do-- 

Charles surprised them by interrupting.  Pater, we may as well keep
Howards End out of it,  he said.

 Why, Charles? 

Charles could give no reason; but Margaret felt as if, over tremendous
distance, a salutation had passed between them.

 The whole house is at sixes and sevens,  he said crossly.  We don t
want any more mess. 

 Who s  we ?  asked his father.  My boy, pray who s  we ? 

 I am sure I beg your pardon,  said Charles.  I appear always to be
intruding. 

By now Margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her
husband. Retreat was impossible. He was determined to push the matter
to a satisfactory conclusion, and Helen faded as he talked. Her fair,
flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing, for she was ill, without
rights, and any of her friends might hunt her. Sick at heart, Margaret
joined in the chase. She wrote her sister a lying letter, at her
husband s dictation; she said the furniture was all at Howards End, but
could be seen on Monday next at 3 P.M., when a charwoman would be in
attendance. It was a cold letter, and the more plausible for that. Helen
would think she was offended. And on Monday next she and Henry were to
lunch with Dolly, and then ambush themselves in the garden.

After they had gone, Mr. Wilcox said to his son:  I can t have this sort
of behaviour, my boy. Margaret s too sweet-natured to mind, but I mind
for her. 

Charles made no answer.

 Is anything wrong with you, Charles, this afternoon? 

 No, pater; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon. 

 How? 

 Don t ask me. 

",it was not unexpected entirely  aunt juley s health had been bad all winter  she had had a long series of colds and coughs  and had been too busy to get rid of them  she had scarcely promised her niece  to really take my tiresome chest in hand   when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia  margaret and tibby went down to swanage  helen was telegraphed for  and that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories  on a perfect day  when the sky seemed blue porcelain  and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand  margaret hurried up through the rhododendrons  confronted again by the senselessness of death  one death may explain itself  but it throws no light upon another  the groping inquiry must begin anew  preachers or scientists may generalise  but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love  not one heaven awaits them  not even one oblivion  aunt juley  incapable of tragedy  slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so long  she was very weak  she could not rise to the occasion  or realise the great mystery which all agree must await her  it only seemed to her that she was quite done up  more done up than ever before  that she saw and heard and felt less every moment  and that  unless something changed  she would soon feel nothing  her spare strength she devoted to plans  could not margaret take some steamer expeditions  were mackerel cooked as tibby liked them  she worried herself about helen s absence  and also that she should be the because of helen s return  the nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural  and perhaps hers was an average approach to the great gate  but margaret saw death stripped of any false romance  whatever the idea of death may contain  the process can be trivial and hideous    important  margaret dear  take the lulworth when helen comes     helen won t be able to stop  aunt juley  she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you  she must go back to germany as soon as you are well     how very odd of helen  mr  wilcox      yes  dear     can he spare you    henry wished her to come  and had been very kind  yet again margaret said so   mrs  munt did not die  quite outside her will  a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope  she returned  without emotion  as fidgety as ever  on the fourth day she was out of danger    margaret  important   it went on   i should like you to have some companion to take walks with  do try miss conder     i have been for a little walk with miss conder     but she is not really interesting  if only you had helen     i have tibby  aunt juley     no  but he has to do his chinese  some real companion is what you need  really  helen is odd     helen is odd  very   agreed margaret    not content with going abroad  why does she want to go back there at once     no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us  she has not the least balance    that was the stock criticism about helen  but margaret s voice trembled as she made it  by now she was deeply pained at her sister s behaviour  it may be unbalanced to fly out of england  but to stay away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head  a sick bed could recall helen  but she was deaf to more human calls  after a glimpse at her aunt  she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante  she scarcely existed  her letters had become dull and infrequent  she had no wants and no curiosity  and it was all put down to poor henry s account  henry  long pardoned by his wife  was still too infamous to be greeted by his sister in law  it was morbid  and  to her alarm  margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in helen s life for nearly four years  the flight from oniton  the unbalanced patronage of the basts  the explosion of grief up on the downs  all connected with paul  an insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time  margaret and mrs  wilcox had feared that they might kiss again  foolishly  the real danger was reaction  reaction against the wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane  at twenty five she had an idee fixe  what hope was there for her as an old woman   the more margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became  for many months she had put the subject away  but it was too big to be slighted now  there was almost a taint of madness  were all helen s actions to be governed by a tiny mishap  such as may happen to any young man or woman  can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant  the blundering little encounter at howards end was vital  it propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren  it was stronger than sisterly intimacy  stronger than reason or books  in one of her moods helen had confessed that she still  enjoyed  it in a certain sense  paul had faded  but the magic of his caress endured  and where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction  propagation at both ends   well  it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed beds  and we without power to choose the seed  but man is an odd  sad creature as yet  intent on pilfering the earth  and heedless of the growths within himself  he cannot be bored about psychology  he leaves it to the specialist  which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam engine  he cannot be bothered to digest his own soul  margaret and helen have been more patient  and it is suggested that margaret has succeeded  so far as success is yet possible  she does understand herself  she has some rudimentary control over her own growth  whether helen has succeeded one cannot say   the day that mrs  munt rallied helen s letter arrived  she had posted it at munich  and would be in london herself on the morrow  it was a disquieting letter  though the opening was affectionate and sane    dearest meg    give helen s love to aunt juley  tell her that i love  and have loved her ever since i can remember  i shall be in london thursday    my address will be care of the bankers  i have not yet settled on a hotel  so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news  if aunt juley is much better  or if  for a terrible reason  it would be no good my coming down to swanage  you must not think it odd if i do not come  i have all sorts of plans in my head  i am living abroad at present  and want to get back as quickly as possible  will you please tell me where our furniture is  i should like to take out one or two books  the rest are for you    forgive me  dearest meg  this must read like rather a tiresome letter  but all letters are from your loving   helen    it was a tiresome letter  for it tempted margaret to tell a lie  if she wrote that aunt juley was still in danger her sister would come  unhealthiness is contagious  we cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating  to  act for the best   might do helen good  but would do herself harm  and  at the risk of disaster  she kept her colours flying a little longer  she replied that their aunt was much better  and awaited developments   tibby approved of her reply  mellowing rapidly  he was a pleasanter companion than before  oxford had done much for him  he had lost his peevishness  and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food  but he had not grown more human  the years between eighteen and twenty two  so magical for most  were leading him gently from boyhood to middle age  he had never known young manliness  that quality which warms the heart till death  and gives mr  wilcox an imperishable charm  he was frigid  through no fault of his own  and without cruelty  he thought helen wrong and margaret right  but the family trouble was for him what a scene behind footlights is for most people  he had only one suggestion to make  and that was characteristic    why don t you tell mr  wilcox     about helen     perhaps he has come across that sort of thing     he would do all he could  but      oh  you know best  but he is practical    it was the student s belief in experts  margaret demurred for one or two reasons  presently helen s answer came  she sent a telegram requesting the address of the furniture  as she would now return at once  margaret replied   certainly not  meet me at the bankers  at four   she and tibby went up to london  helen was not at the bankers   and they were refused her address  helen had passed into chaos   margaret put her arm round her brother  he was all that she had left  and never had he seemed more unsubstantial    tibby love  what next    he replied   it is extraordinary     dear  your judgment s often clearer than mine  have you any notion what s at the back     none  unless it s something mental     oh  that   said margaret   quite impossible   but the suggestion had been uttered  and in a few minutes she took it up herself  nothing else explained  and london agreed with tibby  the mask fell off the city  and she saw it for what it really is  a caricature of infinity  the familiar barriers  the streets along which she moved  the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years  became negligible suddenly  helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly flowing slabs of mud  she had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the one  margaret s own faith held firm  she knew the human soul will be merged  if it be merged at all  with the stars and the sea  yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years  it was symbolic the catastrophe should come now  on a london afternoon  while rain fell slowly   henry was the only hope  henry was definite  he might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them  and she determined to take tibby s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands  they must call at his office  he could not well make it worse  she went for a few moments into st  paul s  whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely  as if preaching the gospel of form  but within  st  paul s is as its surroundings  echoes and whispers  inaudible songs  invisible mosaics  wet footmarks  crossing and recrossing the floor  si monumentum requiris  circumspice  it points us back to london  there was no hope of helen here   henry was unsatisfactory at first  that she had expected  he was overjoyed to see her back from swanage  and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble  when they told him of their search  he only chaffed tibby and the schlegels generally  and declared that it was  just like helen   to lead her relatives a dance    that is what we all say   replied margaret   but why should it be just like helen  why should she be allowed to be so queer  and to grow queerer     don t ask me  i m a plain man of business  i live and let live  my advice to you both is  don t worry  margaret  you ve got black marks again under your eyes  you know that s strictly forbidden  first your aunt  then your sister  no  we aren t going to have it  are we  theobald   he rang the bell   i ll give you some tea  and then you go straight to ducie street  i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband     all the same  you have not quite seen our point   said tibby   mr  wilcox  who was in good spirits  retorted   i don t suppose i ever shall   he leant back  laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family  while the fire flickered over the map of africa  margaret motioned to her brother to go on  rather diffident  he obeyed her    margaret s point is this   he said   our sister may be mad    charles  who was working in the inner room  looked round    come in  charles   said margaret kindly   could you help us at all  we are again in trouble     i m afraid i cannot  what are the facts  we are all mad more or less  you know  in these days     the facts are as follows   replied tibby  who had at times a pedantic lucidity   the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us  she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address  she refuses to answer questions  margaret finds her letters colourless  there are other facts  but these are the most striking     she has never behaved like this before  then   asked henry    of course not   said his wife  with a frown    well  my dear  how am i to know    a senseless spasm of annoyance came over her   you know quite well that helen never sins against affection   she said   you must have noticed that much in her  surely     oh yes  she and i have always hit it off together     no  henry  can t you see   i don t mean that    she recovered herself  but not before charles had observed her  stupid and attentive  he was watching the scene    i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past  one could trace it back to the heart in the long run  she behaved oddly because she cared for some one  or wanted to help them  there s no possible excuse for her now  she is grieving us deeply  and that is why i am sure that she is not well   mad  is too terrible a word  but she is not well  i shall never believe it  i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well  trouble you about her  i mean    henry began to grow serious  ill health was to him something perfectly definite  generally well himself  he could not realise that we sink to it by slow gradations  the sick had no rights  they were outside the pale  one could lie to them remorselessly  when his first wife was seized  he had promised to take her down into hertfordshire  but meanwhile arranged with a nursing home instead  helen  too  was ill  and the plan that he sketched out for her capture  clever and well meaning as it was  drew its ethics from the wolf pack    you want to get hold of her   he said   that s the problem  isn t it  she has got to see a doctor     for all i know she has seen one already     yes  yes  don t interrupt   he rose to his feet and thought intently  the genial  tentative host disappeared  and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of greece and africa  and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin   i ve got it   he said at last   it s perfectly easy  leave it to me  we ll send her down to howards end     how will you do that     after her books  tell her that she must unpack them herself  then you can meet her there     but  henry  that s just what she won t let me do  it s part of her  whatever it is  never to see me     of course you won t tell her you re going  when she is there  looking at the cases  you ll just stroll in  if nothing is wrong with her  so much the better  but there ll be the motor round the corner  and we can run her to a specialist in no time    margaret shook her head   it s quite impossible     why     it doesn t seem impossible to me   said tibby   it is surely a very tippy plan     it is impossible  because    she looked at her husband sadly   it s not the particular language that helen and i talk  if you see my meaning  it would do splendidly for other people  whom i don t blame     but helen doesn t talk   said tibby   that s our whole difficulty  she won t talk your particular language  and on that account you think she s ill     no  henry  it s sweet of you  but i couldn t     i see   he said   you have scruples     i suppose so     and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer  you could have got her down to swanage by a word  but you had scruples  and scruples are all very well  i am as scrupulous as any man alive  i hope  but when it is a case like this  when there is a question of madness      i deny it s madness     you said just now      it s madness when i say it  but not when you say it    henry shrugged his shoulders   margaret  margaret   he groaned   no education can teach a woman

34,34,7241,7302,7363,"

One speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her true
children have only one mood; they are all full of the rising and
dropping of winds, and the whistling of birds. New flowers may come out,
the green embroidery of the hedges increase, but the same heaven broods
overhead, soft, thick, and blue, the same figures, seen and unseen, are
wandering by coppice and meadow. The morning that Margaret had spent
with Miss Avery, and the afternoon she set out to entrap Helen, were the
scales of a single balance. Time might never have moved, rain never
have fallen, and man alone, with his schemes and ailments, was troubling
Nature until he saw her through a veil of tears.

She protested no more. Whether Henry was right or wrong, he was most
kind, and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him. She
must trust him absolutely. As soon as he had taken up a business, his
obtuseness vanished. He profited by the slightest indications, and the
capture of Helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of
Evie.

They went down in the morning as arranged, and he discovered that their
victim was actually in Hilton. On his arrival he called at all
the livery-stables in the village, and had a few minutes  serious
conversation with the proprietors. What he said, Margaret did not
know--perhaps not the truth; but news arrived after lunch that a lady
had come by the London train, and had taken a fly to Howards End.

 She was bound to drive,  said Henry.  There will be her books. 

 I cannot make it out,  said Margaret for the hundredth time.

 Finish your coffee, dear. We must be off. 

 Yes, Margaret, you know you must take plenty,  said Dolly.

Margaret tried, but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes. Dolly stole
glances at her father-in-law which he did not answer. In the silence the
motor came round to the door.

 You re not fit for it,  he said anxiously.  Let me go alone. I know
exactly what to do. 

 Oh yes, I am fit,  said Margaret, uncovering her face.  Only most
frightfully worried. I cannot feel that Helen is really alive. Her
letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else. Her voice
isn t in them. I don t believe your driver really saw her at the
station. I wish I d never mentioned it. I know that Charles is vexed.
Yes, he is--  She seized Dolly s hand and kissed it.  There, Dolly will
forgive me. There. Now we ll be off. 

Henry had been looking at her closely. He did not like this breakdown.

 Don t you want to tidy yourself?  he asked.

 Have I time? 

 Yes, plenty. 

She went to the lavatory by the front door, and as soon as the bolt
slipped, Mr. Wilcox said quietly:

 Dolly, I m going without her. 

Dolly s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement. She followed him on tiptoe
out to the car.

 Tell her I thought it best. 

 Yes, Mr. Wilcox, I see. 

 Say anything you like. All right. 

The car started well, and with ordinary luck would have got away. But
Porgly-woggles, who was playing in the garden, chose this moment to sit
down in the middle of the path. Crane, in trying to pass him, ran one
wheel over a bed of wallflowers. Dolly screamed. Margaret, hearing the
noise, rushed out hatless, and was in time to jump on the footboard.
She said not a single word; he was only treating her as she had treated
Helen, and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what Helen
would feel against them. She thought,  I deserve it; I am punished for
lowering my colours.  And she accepted his apologies with a calmness
that astonished him.

 I still consider you are not fit for it,  he kept saying.

 Perhaps I was not at lunch. But the whole thing is spread clearly
before me now. 

 I was meaning to act for the best. 

 Just lend me your scarf, will you. This wind takes one s hair so. 

 Certainly, dear girl. Are you all right now? 

 Look! My hands have stopped trembling. 

 And have quite forgiven me? Then listen. Her cab should already have
arrived at Howards End. (We re a little late, but no matter.) Our first
move will be to send it down to wait at the farm, as, if possible, one
doesn t want a scene before servants. A certain gentleman --he pointed
at Crane s back-- won t drive in, but will wait a little short of the
front gate, behind the laurels. Have you still the keys of the house? 

 Yes. 

 Well, they aren t wanted. Do you remember how the house stands? 

 Yes. 

 If we don t find her in the porch, we can stroll round into the garden.
Our object-- 

Here they stopped to pick up the doctor.

 I was just saying to my wife, Mansbridge, that our main object is not
to frighten Miss Schlegel. The house, as you know, is my property, so it
should seem quite natural for us to be there. The trouble is evidently
nervous--wouldn t you say so, Margaret? 

The doctor, a very young man, began to ask questions about Helen. Was
she normal? Was there anything congenital or hereditary? Had anything
occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family?

 Nothing,  answered Margaret, wondering what would have happened if she
had added:  Though she did resent my husband s immorality. 

 She always was highly strung,  pursued Henry, leaning back in the
car as it shot past the church.  A tendency to spiritualism and those
things, though nothing serious. Musical, literary, artistic, but I
should say normal--a very charming girl. 

Margaret s anger and terror increased every moment. How dare these
men label her sister! What horrors lay ahead! What impertinences that
shelter under the name of science! The pack was turning on Helen, to
deny her human rights, and it seemed to Margaret that all Schlegels were
threatened with her.  Were they normal?  What a question to ask! And it
is always those who know nothing about human nature, who are bored by
psychology--and shocked by physiology, who ask it. However piteous her
sister s state, she knew that she must be on her side. They would be mad
together if the world chose to consider them so.

It was now five minutes past three. The car slowed down by the farm, in
the yard of which Miss Avery was standing. Henry asked her whether a cab
had gone past. She nodded, and the next moment they caught sight of it,
at the end of the lane. The car ran silently like a beast of prey. So
unsuspicious was Helen that she was sitting in the porch, with her back
to the road. She had come. Only her head and shoulders were visible. She
sat framed in the vine, and one of her hands played with the buds. The
wind ruffled her hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always
been.

Margaret was seated next to the door. Before her husband could prevent
her, she slipped out. She ran to the garden gate, which was shut, passed
through it, and deliberately pushed it in his face. The noise alarmed
Helen. Margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement, and, rushing
into the porch, learnt the simple explanation of all their fears--her
sister was with child.

 Is the truant all right?  called Henry.

She had time to whisper:  Oh, my darling--  The keys of the house were
in her hand. She unlocked Howards End and thrust Helen into it.  Yes,
all right,  she said, and stood with her back to the door.

margaret had spent with miss avery  and the afternoon she set out to entrap helen  were the scales of a single balance  time might never have moved  rain never have fallen  and man alone  with his schemes and ailments  was troubling nature until he saw her through a veil of tears   she protested no more  whether henry was right or wrong  he was most kind  and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him  she must trust him absolutely  as soon as he had taken up a business  his obtuseness vanished  he profited by the slightest indications  and the capture of helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of evie   they went down in the morning as arranged  and he discovered that their victim was actually in hilton  on his arrival he called at all the livery stables in the village  and had a few minutes  serious conversation with the proprietors  what he said  margaret did not know  perhaps not the truth  but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the london train  and had taken a fly to howards end    she was bound to drive   said henry   there will be her books     i cannot make it out   said margaret for the hundredth time    finish your coffee  dear  we must be off     yes  margaret  you know you must take plenty   said dolly   margaret tried  but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes  dolly stole glances at her father in law which he did not answer  in the silence the motor came round to the door    you re not fit for it   he said anxiously   let me go alone  i know exactly what to do     oh yes  i am fit   said margaret  uncovering her face   only most frightfully worried  i cannot feel that helen is really alive  her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else  her voice isn t in them  i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station  i wish i d never mentioned it  i know that charles is vexed  yes  he is    she seized dolly s hand and kissed it   there  dolly will forgive me  there  now we ll be off    henry had been looking at her closely  he did not like this breakdown    don t you want to tidy yourself   he asked    have i time     yes  plenty    she went to the lavatory by the front door  and as soon as the bolt slipped  mr  wilcox said quietly    dolly  i m going without her    dolly s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement  she followed him on tiptoe out to the car    tell her i thought it best     yes  mr  wilcox  i see     say anything you like  all right    the car started well  and with ordinary luck would have got away  but porgly woggles  who was playing in the garden  chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the path  crane  in trying to pass him  ran one wheel over a bed of wallflowers  dolly screamed  margaret  hearing the noise  rushed out hatless  and was in time to jump on the footboard  she said not a single word  he was only treating her as she had treated helen  and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what helen would feel against them  she thought   i deserve it  i am punished for lowering my colours   and she accepted his apologies with a calmness that astonished him    i still consider you are not fit for it   he kept saying    perhaps i was not at lunch  but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now     i was meaning to act for the best     just lend me your scarf  will you  this wind takes one s hair so     certainly  dear girl  are you all right now     look  my hands have stopped trembling     and have quite forgiven me  then listen  her cab should already have arrived at howards end   we re a little late  but no matter   our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm  as  if possible  one doesn t want a scene before servants  a certain gentleman   he pointed at crane s back   won t drive in  but will wait a little short of the front gate  behind the laurels  have you still the keys of the house     yes     well  they aren t wanted  do you remember how the house stands     yes     if we don t find her in the porch  we can stroll round into the garden  our object     here they stopped to pick up the doctor    i was just saying to my wife  mansbridge  that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel  the house  as you know  is my property  so it should seem quite natural for us to be there  the trouble is evidently nervous  wouldn t you say so  margaret    the doctor  a very young man  began to ask questions about helen  was she normal  was there anything congenital or hereditary  had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family    nothing   answered margaret  wondering what would have happened if she had added   though she did resent my husband s immorality     she always was highly strung   pursued henry  leaning back in the car as it shot past the church   a tendency to spiritualism and those things  though nothing serious  musical  literary  artistic  but i should say normal  a very charming girl    margaret s anger and terror increased every moment  how dare these men label her sister  what horrors lay ahead  what impertinences that shelter under the name of science  the pack was turning on helen  to deny her human rights  and it seemed to margaret that all schlegels were threatened with her   were they normal   what a question to ask  and it is always those who know nothing about human nature  who are bored by psychology  and shocked by physiology  who ask it  however piteous her sister s state  she knew that she must be on her side  they would be mad together if the world chose to consider them so   it was now five minutes past three  the car slowed down by the farm  in the yard of which miss avery was standing  henry asked her whether a cab had gone past  she nodded  and the next moment they caught sight of it  at the end of the lane  the car ran silently like a beast of prey  so unsuspicious was helen that she was sitting in the porch  with her back to the road  she had come  only her head and shoulders were visible  she sat framed in the vine  and one of her hands played with the buds  the wind ruffled her hair  the sun glorified it  she was as she had always been   margaret was seated next to the door  before her husband could prevent her  she slipped out  she ran to the garden gate  which was shut  passed through it  and deliberately pushed it in his face  the noise alarmed helen  margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement  and  rushing into the porch  learnt the simple explanation of all their fears  her sister was with child    is the truant all right   called henry   she had time to whisper   oh  my darling    the keys of the house were in her hand  she unlocked howards end and thrust helen into it   yes  all right   she said  and stood with her back to the door,7151,1305,1.5500000000000032,-0.7861818096745983,-0.2343173431734317,-0.7747585286692118,-0.4233337821948429,9.85,-0.6073305392164013,-0.2373887240356085,-0.2409282534133393,-0.1260337209293539,-134.46066459951768,-0.2710958705029647,-0.18262083272842072,-0.614896910494473,-0.3998054250189613,2.8135809523809505,-0.6068883794355027,-0.21319016184705927,-0.36617260512293803,-0.2620342952601732,50.65799999999998,-0.6507404901574869,-0.34509819156581883,1.047197374209092,0.7997457801145937,75.66572216088673,-0.8822838237340699,-0.5281631420389038,-0.5309196025737526,-0.5664919583685453,-0.4120408670364013,-0.5152034574014952,-0.20986942779536025,-0.4624268309256596,-0.4040578682360885,"{'neg':

35,35,7364,7412,7461,"

 Margaret, you look upset!  said Henry.

Mansbridge had followed. Crane was at the gate, and the flyman had stood
up on the box. Margaret shook her head at them; she could not speak any
more. She remained clutching the keys, as if all their future depended
on them. Henry was asking more questions. She shook her head again. His
words had no sense. She heard him wonder why she had let Helen in.  You
might have given me a knock with the gate,  was another of his remarks.
Presently she heard herself speaking. She, or someone for her, said,  Go
away.  Henry came nearer. He repeated,  Margaret, you look upset again.
My dear, give me the keys. What are you doing with Helen? 

 Oh, dearest, do go away, and I will manage it all. 

 Manage what? 

He stretched out his hand for the keys. She might have obeyed if it had
not been for the doctor.

 Stop that at least,  she said piteously; the doctor had turned back,
and was questioning the driver of Helen s cab. A new feeling came over
her; she was fighting for women against men. She did not care about
rights, but if men came into Howards End, it should be over her body.

 Come, this is an odd beginning,  said her husband.

The doctor came forward now, and whispered two words to Mr. Wilcox--the
scandal was out. Sincerely horrified, Henry stood gazing at the earth.

 I cannot help it,  said Margaret.  Do wait. It s not my fault. Please
all four of you go away now. 

Now the flyman was whispering to Crane.

 We are relying on you to help us, Mrs. Wilcox,  said the young doctor.
 Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out? 

 On what grounds?  said Margaret, suddenly looking him straight in the
eyes.

Thinking it professional to prevaricate, he murmured something about a
nervous breakdown.

 I beg your pardon, but it is nothing of the sort. You are not qualified
to attend my sister, Mr. Mansbridge. If we require your services, we
will let you know. 

 I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish,  he retorted.

 You could, but you have not. You are, therefore, not qualified to
attend my sister. 

 Come, come, Margaret!  said Henry, never raising his eyes.  This is a
terrible business, an appalling business. It s doctor s orders. Open the
door. 

 Forgive me, but I will not. 

 I don t agree. 

Margaret was silent.

 This business is as broad as it s long,  contributed the doctor.  We
had better all work together. You need us, Mrs. Wilcox, and we need
you. 

 Quite so,  said Henry.

 I do not need you in the least,  said Margaret.

The two men looked at each other anxiously.

 No more does my sister, who is still many weeks from her confinement. 

 Margaret, Margaret! 

 Well, Henry, send your doctor away. What possible use is he now? 

Mr. Wilcox ran his eye over the house. He had a vague feeling that he
must stand firm and support the doctor. He himself might need support,
for there was trouble ahead.

 It all turns on affection now,  said Margaret.  Affection. Don t you
see?  Resuming her usual methods, she wrote the word on the house with
her finger.  Surely you see. I like Helen very much, you not so much.
Mr. Mansbridge doesn t know her. That s all. And affection, when
reciprocated, gives rights. Put that down in your note-book, Mr.
Mansbridge. It s a useful formula. 

Henry told her to be calm.

 You don t know what you want yourselves,  said Margaret, folding her
arms.  For one sensible remark I will let you in. But you cannot make
it. You would trouble my sister for no reason. I will not permit it.
I ll stand here all the day sooner. 

 Mansbridge,  said Henry in a low voice,  perhaps not now. 

The pack was breaking up. At a sign from his master, Crane also went
back into the car.

 Now, Henry, you,  she said gently. None of her bitterness had been
directed at him.  Go away now, dear. I shall want your advice later, no
doubt. Forgive me if I have been cross. But, seriously, you must go. 

He was too stupid to leave her. Now it was Mr. Mansbridge who called in
a low voice to him.

 I shall soon find you down at Dolly s,  she called, as the gate at last
clanged between them. The fly moved out of the way, the motor backed,
turned a little, backed again, and turned in the narrow road. A string
of farm carts came up in the middle; but she waited through all, for
there was no hurry. When all was over and the car had started, she
opened the door.  Oh, my darling!  she said.  My darling, forgive me. 
 Helen was standing in the hall.

36,36,7462,7640,7818,"

Margaret bolted the door on the inside. Then she would have kissed her
sister, but Helen, in a dignified voice, that came strangely from her,
said:

 Convenient! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked. I have
found nearly everything that I want. 

 I told you nothing that was true. 

 It has been a great surprise, certainly. Has Aunt Juley been ill? 

 Helen, you wouldn t think I d invent that? 

 I suppose not,  said Helen, turning away, and crying a very little.
 But one loses faith in everything after this. 

 We thought it was illness, but even then--I haven t behaved worthily. 

Helen selected another book.

 I ought not to have consulted any one. What would our father have
thought of me? 

She did not think of questioning her sister, or of rebuking her. Both
might be necessary in the future, but she had first to purge a greater
crime than any that Helen could have committed--that want of confidence
that is the work of the devil.

 Yes, I am annoyed,  replied Helen.  My wishes should have been
respected. I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary,
but after Aunt Juley recovered, it was not necessary. Planning my life,
as I now have to do. 

 Come away from those books,  called Margaret.  Helen, do talk to me. 

 I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard. One can t go
through a great deal of -- --she left out the noun-- without planning one s
actions in advance. I am going to have a child in June, and in the first
place conversations, discussions, excitement, are not good for me. I
will go through them if necessary, but only then. In the second place I
have no right to trouble people. I cannot fit in with England as I know
it. I have done something that the English never pardon. It would not be
right for them to pardon it. So I must live where I am not known. 

 But why didn t you tell me, dearest? 

 Yes,  replied Helen judicially.  I might have, but decided to wait. 

 I believe you would never have told me. 

 Oh yes, I should. We have taken a flat in Munich. 

Margaret glanced out of the window.

 By  we  I mean myself and Monica. But for her, I am and have been and
always wish to be alone. 

 I have not heard of Monica. 

 You wouldn t have. She s an Italian--by birth at least. She makes her
living by journalism. I met her originally on Garda. Monica is much the
best person to see me through. 

 You are very fond of her, then. 

 She has been extraordinarily sensible with me. 

Margaret guessed at Monica s type-- Italiano Inglesiato  they had named
it--the crude feminist of the South, whom one respects but avoids. And
Helen had turned to it in her need!

 You must not think that we shall never meet,  said Helen, with a
measured kindness.  I shall always have a room for you when you can be
spared, and the longer you can be with me the better. But you haven t
understood yet, Meg, and of course it is very difficult for you. This is
a shock to you. It isn t to me, who have been thinking over our futures
for many months, and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps, such
as this. I cannot live in England. 

 Helen, you ve not forgiven me for my treachery. You COULDN T talk like
this to me if you had. 

 Oh, Meg dear, why do we talk at all?  She dropped a book and sighed
wearily. Then, recovering herself, she said:  Tell me, how is it that
all the books are down here? 

 Series of mistakes. 

 And a great deal of furniture has been unpacked. 

 All. 

 Who lives here, then? 

 No one. 

 I suppose you are letting it, though. 

 The house is dead,  said Margaret, with a frown.  Why worry on about
it? 

 But I am interested. You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life.
I am still Helen, I hope. Now this hasn t the feel of a dead house.
The hall seems more alive even than in the old days, when it held the
Wilcoxes  own things. 

 Interested, are you? Very well, I must tell you, I suppose. My husband
lent it on condition we--but by a mistake all our things were unpacked,
and Miss Avery, instead of--  She stopped.  Look here, I can t go on
like this. I warn you I won t. Helen, why should you be so miserably
unkind to me, simply because you hate Henry? 

 I don t hate him now,  said Helen.  I have stopped being a schoolgirl,
and, Meg, once again, I m not being unkind. But as for fitting in with
your English life--no, put it out of your head at once. Imagine a visit
from me at Ducie Street! It s unthinkable. 

Margaret could not contradict her. It was appalling to see her quietly
moving forward with her plans, not bitter or excitable, neither
asserting innocence nor confessing guilt, merely desiring freedom and
the company of those who would not blame her. She had been through--how
much? Margaret did not know. But it was enough to part her from old
habits as well as old friends.

 Tell me about yourself,  said Helen, who had chosen her books, and was
lingering over the furniture.

 There s nothing to tell. 

 But your marriage has been happy, Meg? 

 Yes, but I don t feel inclined to talk. 

 You feel as I do. 

 Not that, but I can t. 

 No more can I. It is a nuisance, but no good trying. 

Something had come between them. Perhaps it was Society, which
henceforward would exclude Helen. Perhaps it was a third life, already
potent as a spirit. They could find no meeting-place. Both suffered
acutely, and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection
survived.

 Look here, Meg, is the coast clear? 

 You mean that you want to go away from me? 

 I suppose so--dear old lady! it isn t any use. I knew we should have
nothing to say. Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby, and take more
yourself than I can say. Promise to come and see me in Munich later. 

 Certainly, dearest. 

 For that is all we can do. 

It seemed so. Most ghastly of all was Helen s common sense; Monica had
been extraordinarily good for her.

 I am glad to have seen you and the things.  She looked at the bookcase
lovingly, as if she was saying farewell to the past.

Margaret unbolted the door. She remarked:  The car has gone, and here s
your cab. 

She led the way to it, glancing at the leaves and the sky. The spring
had never seemed more beautiful. The driver, who was leaning on the
gate, called out,  Please, lady, a message,  and handed her Henry s
visiting-card through the bars.

 How did this come?  she asked.

Crane had returned with it almost at once.

She read the card with annoyance. It was covered with instructions in
domestic French. When she and her sister had talked she was to come back
for the night to Dolly s.  Il faut dormir sur ce sujet.  while Helen
was to be found une comfortable chambre a l hotel. The final sentence
displeased her greatly until she remembered that the Charles s had only
one spare room, and so could not invite a third guest.

 Henry would have done what he could,  she interpreted.

Helen had not followed her into the garden. The door once open, she lost
her inclination to fly. She remained in the hall, going from bookcase to
table. She grew more like the old Helen, irresponsible and charming.

 This IS Mr. Wilcox s house?  she inquired.

 Surely you remember Howards End? 

 Remember? I who remember everything! But it looks to be ours now. 

 Miss Avery was extraordinary,  said Margaret, her own spirits
lightening a little. Again she was invaded by a slight feeling of
disloyalty. But it brought her relief, and she yielded to it.  She loved
Mrs. Wilcox, and would rather furnish her home with our things than
think of it empty. In consequence here are all the library books. 

 Not all the books. She hasn t unpacked the Art books, in which she may
show her sense. And we never used to have the sword here. 

 The sword looks well, though. 

 Magnificent. 

 Yes, doesn t it? 

 Where s the piano, Meg? 

 I warehoused that in London. Why? 

 Nothing. 

 Curious, too, that the carpet fits. 

 The carpet s a mistake,  announced Helen.  I know that we had it in
London, but this floor ought to be bare. It is far too beautiful. 

 You still have a mania for under-furnishing. Would you care to come
into the dining-room before you start? There s no carpet there. 

They went in, and each minute their talk became more natural.

 Oh, WHAT a place for mother s chiffonier!  cried Helen.

 Look at the chairs, though. 

 Oh, look at them! Wickham Place faced north, didn t it? 

 North-west. 

 Anyhow, it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun.
Feel. Their dear little backs are quite warm. 

 But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners? I shall just-- 

 Over here, Meg. Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn. 

Margaret moved a chair. Helen sat down in it.

 Ye--es. The window s too high. 

 Try a drawing-room chair. 

 No, I don t like the drawing-room so much. The beam has been
match-boarded. It would have been so beautiful otherwise. 

 Helen, what a memory you have for some things! You re perfectly right.
It s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for
women. Men don t know what we want-- 

 And never will. 

 I don t agree. In two thousand years they ll know. Look where Tibby
spilt the soup. 

 Coffee. It was coffee surely. 

Helen shook her head.  Impossible. Tibby was far too young to be given
coffee at that time. 

 Was father alive? 

 Yes. 

 Then you re right and it must have been soup. I was thinking of much
later--that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley s, when she didn t realise
that Tibby had grown up. It was coffee then, for he threw it down on
purpose. There was some rhyme,  Tea, coffee--coffee tea,  that she said
to him every morning at breakfast. Wait a minute--how did it go? 

 I know--no, I don t. What a detestable boy Tibby was! 

 But the rhyme was simply awful. No decent person could put up with it. 

 Ah, that greengage-tree,  cried Helen, as if the garden was also part
of their childhood.  Why do I connect it with dumb-bells? And there come
the chickens. The grass wants cutting. I love yellow-hammers. 

Margaret interrupted her.  I have got it,  she announced.

         Tea, tea, coffee, tea,
         Or chocolaritee. 

 That every morning for three weeks. No wonder Tibby was wild. 

 Tibby is moderately a dear now,  said Helen.

 There! I knew you d say that in the end. Of course he s a dear. 

A bell rang.

 Listen! what s that? 

Helen said,  Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege. 

 What nonsense--listen! 

And the triviality faded from their faces, though it left something
behind--the knowledge that they never could be parted because their love
was rooted in common things. Explanations and appeals had failed; they
had tried for a common meeting-ground, and had only made each other
unhappy. And all the time their salvation was lying round them--the past
sanctifying the present; the present, with wild heart-throb, declaring
that there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of
children. Helen, still smiling, came up to her sister. She said,  It
is always Meg.  They looked into each other s eyes. The inner life had
paid.

Solemnly the clapper tolled. No one was in the front. Margaret went to
the kitchen, and struggled between packing-cases to the window. Their
visitor was only a little boy with a tin can. And triviality returned.

 Little boy, what do you want? 

 Please, I am the milk. 

 Did Miss Avery send you?  said Margaret, rather sharply.

 Yes, please. 

 Then take it back and say we require no milk.  While she called to
Helen,  No, it s not the siege, but possibly an attempt to provision us
against one. 

 But I like milk,  cried Helen.  Why send it away? 

 Do you? Oh, very well. But we ve nothing to put it in, and he wants the
can. 

 Please, I m to call in the morning for the can,  said the boy.

 The house will be locked up then. 

 In the morning would I bring eggs too? 

 Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week? 

The child hung his head.

 Well, run away and do it again. 

 Nice little boy,  whispered Helen.  I say, what s your name? Mine s
Helen. 

 Tom. 

That was Helen all over. The Wilcoxes, too, would ask a child its name,
but they never told their names in return.

 Tom, this one here is Margaret. And at home we ve another called Tibby. 

 Mine are lop-eareds,  replied Tom, supposing Tibby to be a rabbit.

 You re a very good and rather a clever little boy. Mind you come
again.--Isn t he charming? 

 Undoubtedly,  said Margaret.  He is probably the son of Madge, and
Madge is dreadful. But this place has wonderful powers. 

 What do you mean? 

 I don t know. 

 Because I probably agree with you. 

 It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live. 

 I do agree,  said Helen, as she sipped the milk.  But you said that the
house was dead not half an hour ago. 

 Meaning that I was dead. I felt it. 

 Yes, the house has a surer life than we, even if it was empty, and, as
it is, I can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone
full on our furniture. After all, Wickham Place was a grave. Meg, I ve a
startling idea. 

 What is it? 

 Drink some milk to steady you. 

Margaret obeyed.

 No, I won t tell you yet,  said Helen,  because you may laugh or be
angry. Let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing. 

They opened window after window, till the inside, too, was rustling
to the spring. Curtains blew, picture frames tapped cheerfully. Helen
uttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right
place, that in its wrong one. She was angry with Miss Avery for not
having moved the wardrobes up.  Then one would see really.  She admired
the view. She was the Helen who had written the memorable letters four
years ago. As they leant out, looking westward, she said:  About my
idea. Couldn t you and I camp out in this house for the night? 

 I don t think we could well do that,  said Margaret.

 Here are beds, tables, towels-- 

 I know; but the house isn t supposed to be slept in, and Henry s
suggestion was-- 

 I require no suggestions. I shall not alter anything in my plans. But
it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you. It
will be something to look back on. Oh, Meg lovey, do let s! 

 But, Helen, my pet,  said Margaret,  we can t without getting Henry s
leave. Of course, he would give it, but you said yourself that you
couldn t visit at Ducie Street now, and this is equally intimate. 

 Ducie Street is his house. This is ours. Our furniture, our sort of
people coming to the door. Do let us camp out, just one night, and Tom
shall feed us on eggs and milk. Why not? It s a moon. 

Margaret hesitated.  I feel Charles wouldn t like it,  she said at last.
 Even our furniture annoyed him, and I was going to clear it out when
Aunt Juley s illness prevented me. I sympathise with Charles. He feels
it s his mother s house. He loves it in rather an untaking way. Henry I
could answer for--not Charles. 

 I know he won t like it,  said Helen.  But I am going to pass out of
their lives. What difference will it make in the long run if they say,
 And she even spent the night at Howards End ? 

 How do you know you ll pass out of their lives? We have thought that
twice before. 

 Because my plans-- 

 --which you change in a moment. 

 Then because my life is great and theirs are little,  said Helen,
taking fire.  I know of things they can t know of, and so do you. We
know that there s poetry. We know that there s death. They can only take
them on hearsay. We know this is our house, because it feels ours. Oh,
they may take the title-deeds and the door-keys, but for this one night
we are at home. 

 It would be lovely to have you once more alone,  said Margaret.  It may
be a chance in a thousand. 

 Yes, and we could talk.  She dropped her voice.  It won t be a
very glorious story. But under that wych-elm--honestly, I see little
happiness ahead. Cannot I have this one night with you? 

 I needn t say how much it would mean to me. 

 Then let us. 

 It is no good hesitating. Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get
leave? 

 Oh, we don t want leave. 

But Margaret was a loyal wife. In spite of imagination and
poetry--perhaps on account of them--she could sympathise with the
technical attitude that Henry would adopt. If possible, she would be
technical, too. A night s lodging--and they demanded no more--need not
involve the discussion of general principles.

 Charles may say no,  grumbled Helen.

 We shan t consult him. 

 Go if you like; I should have stopped without leave. 

It was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to mar Helen s
character, and even added to its beauty. She would have stopped without
leave and escaped to Germany the next morning. Margaret kissed her.

 Expect me back before dark. I am looking forward to it so much. It is
like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing. 

 Not a thing, only an ending,  said Helen rather sadly; and the sense of
tragedy closed in on Margaret again as soon as she left the house.

She was afraid of Miss Avery. It is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy,
however superficially. She was glad to see no watching figure as she
drove past the farm, but only little Tom, turning somersaults in the
straw.

",margaret bolted the door on the inside  then she would have kissed her sister  but helen  in a dignified voice  that came strangely from her  said    convenient  you did not tell me that the books were unpacked  i have found nearly everything that i want     i told you nothing that was true     it has been a great surprise  certainly  has aunt juley been ill     helen  you wouldn t think i d invent that     i suppose not   said helen  turning away  and crying a very little   but one loses faith in everything after this     we thought it was illness  but even then  i haven t behaved worthily    helen selected another book    i ought not to have consulted any one  what would our father have thought of me    she did not think of questioning her sister  or of rebuking her  both might be necessary in the future  but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that helen could have committed  that want of confidence that is the work of the devil    yes  i am annoyed   replied helen   my wishes should have been respected  i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary  but after aunt juley recovered  it was not necessary  planning my life  as i now have to do     come away from those books   called margaret   helen  do talk to me     i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard  one can t go through a great deal of      she left out the noun   without planning one s actions in advance  i am going to have a child in june  and in the first place conversations  discussions  excitement  are not good for me  i will go through them if necessary  but only then  in the second place i have no right to trouble people  i cannot fit in with england as i know it  i have done something that the english never pardon  it would not be right for them to pardon it  so i must live where i am not known     but why didn t you tell me  dearest     yes   replied helen judicially   i might have  but decided to wait     i believe you would never have told me     oh yes  i should  we have taken a flat in munich    margaret glanced out of the window    by  we  i mean myself and monica  but for her  i am and have been and always wish to be alone     i have not heard of monica     you wouldn t have  she s an italian  by birth at least  she makes her living by journalism  i met her originally on garda  monica is much the best person to see me through     you are very fond of her  then     she has been extraordinarily sensible with me    margaret guessed at monica s type   italiano inglesiato  they had named it  the crude feminist of the south  whom one respects but avoids  and helen had turned to it in her need    you must not think that we shall never meet   said helen  with a measured kindness   i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared  and the longer you can be with me the better  but you haven t understood yet  meg  and of course it is very difficult for you  this is a shock to you  it isn t to me  who have been thinking over our futures for many months  and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps  such as this  i cannot live in england     helen  you ve not forgiven me for my treachery  you couldn t talk like this to me if you had     oh  meg dear  why do we talk at all   she dropped a book and sighed wearily  then  recovering herself  she said   tell me  how is it that all the books are down here     series of mistakes     and a great deal of furniture has been unpacked     all     who lives here  then     no one     i suppose you are letting it  though     the house is dead   said margaret  with a frown   why worry on about it     but i am interested  you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life  i am still helen  i hope  now this hasn t the feel of a dead house  the hall seems more alive even than in the old days  when it held the wilcoxes  own things     interested  are you  very well  i must tell you  i suppose  my husband lent it on condition we  but by a mistake all our things were unpacked  and miss avery  instead of    she stopped   look here  i can t go on like this  i warn you i won t  helen  why should you be so miserably unkind to me  simply because you hate henry     i don t hate him now   said helen   i have stopped being a schoolgirl  and  meg  once again  i m not being unkind  but as for fitting in with your english life  no  put it out of your head at once  imagine a visit from me at ducie street  it s unthinkable    margaret could not contradict her  it was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans  not bitter or excitable  neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt  merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her  she had been through  how much  margaret did not know  but it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends    tell me about yourself   said helen  who had chosen her books  and was lingering over the furniture    there s nothing to tell     but your marriage has been happy  meg     yes  but i don t feel inclined to talk     you feel as i do     not that  but i can t     no more can i  it is a nuisance  but no good trying    something had come between them  perhaps it was society  which henceforward would exclude helen  perhaps it was a third life  already potent as a spirit  they could find no meeting place  both suffered acutely  and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived    look here  meg  is the coast clear     you mean that you want to go away from me     i suppose so  dear old lady  it isn t any use  i knew we should have nothing to say  give my love to aunt juley and tibby  and take more yourself than i can say  promise to come and see me in munich later     certainly  dearest     for that is all we can do    it seemed so  most ghastly of all was helen s common sense  monica had been extraordinarily good for her    i am glad to have seen you and the things   she looked at the bookcase lovingly  as if

The tragedy began quietly enough, and, like many another talk, by the
man s deft assertion of his superiority. Henry heard her arguing with
the driver, stepped out and settled the fellow, who was inclined to be
rude, and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn. Dolly, who
had not been  told,  ran out with offers of tea. He refused them, and
ordered them to wheel baby s perambulator away, as they desired to be
alone.

 But the diddums can t listen; he isn t nine months old,  she pleaded.

 That s not what I was saying,  retorted her father-in-law.

Baby was wheeled out of earshot, and did not hear about the crisis till
later years. It was now the turn of Margaret.

 Is it what we feared?  he asked.

 It is. 

 Dear girl,  he began,  there is a troublesome business ahead of us,
and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see
us through.  Margaret bent her head.  I am obliged to question you on
subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched. As you know, I am not one
of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred. To speak as I must
will pain me, but there are occasions--We are husband and wife, not
children. I am a man of the world, and you are a most exceptional
woman. 

All Margaret s senses forsook her. She blushed, and looked past him at
the Six Hills, covered with spring herbage. Noting her colour, he grew
still more kind.

 I see that you feel as I felt when--My poor little wife! Oh, be brave!
Just one or two questions, and I have done with you. Was your sister
wearing a wedding-ring? 

Margaret stammered a  No. 

There was an appalling silence.

 Henry, I really came to ask a favour about Howards End. 

 One point at a time. I am now obliged to ask for the name of her
seducer. 

She rose to her feet and held the chair between them. Her colour had
ebbed, and she was grey. It did not displease him that she should
receive his question thus.

 Take your time,  he counselled her.  Remember that this is far worse
for me than for you. 

She swayed; he feared she was going to faint. Then speech came, and she
said slowly:  Seducer? No; I do not know her seducer s name. 

 Would she not tell you? 

 I never even asked her who seduced her,  said Margaret, dwelling on the
hateful word thoughtfully.

 That is singular.  Then he changed his mind.  Natural perhaps, dear
girl, that you shouldn t ask. But until his name is known, nothing can
be done. Sit down. How terrible it is to see you so upset! I knew you
weren t fit for it. I wish I hadn t taken you. 

Margaret answered,  I like to stand, if you don t mind, for it gives me
a pleasant view of the Six Hills. 

 As you like. 

 Have you anything else to ask me, Henry? 

 Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything. I have often
noticed your insight, dear. I only wish my own was as good. You may have
guessed something, even though your sister said nothing. The slightest
hint would help us. 

 Who is  we ? 

 I thought it best to ring up Charles. 

 That was unnecessary,  said Margaret, growing warmer.  This news will
give Charles disproportionate pain. 

 He has at once gone to call on your brother. 

 That too was unnecessary. 

 Let me explain, dear, how the matter stands. You don t think that I and
my son are other than gentlemen? It is in Helen s interests that we are
acting. It is still not too late to save her name. 

Then Margaret hit out for the first time.  Are we to make her seducer
marry her?  she asked.

 If possible, yes. 

 But, Henry, suppose he turned out to be married already? One has heard
of such cases. 

 In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct, and be thrashed
within an inch of his life. 

So her first blow missed. She was thankful of it. What had tempted her
to imperil both of their lives. Henry s obtuseness had saved her as well
as himself. Exhausted with anger, she sat down again, blinking at him as
he told her as much as he thought fit. At last she said:  May I ask you
my question now? 

 Certainly, my dear. 

 To-morrow Helen goes to Munich-- 

 Well, possibly she is right. 

 Henry, let a lady finish. To-morrow she goes; to-night, with your
permission, she would like to sleep at Howards End. 

It was the crisis of his life. Again she would have recalled the words
as soon as they were uttered. She had not led up to them with sufficient
care. She longed to warn him that they were far more important than
he supposed. She saw him weighing them, as if they were a business
proposition.

 Why Howards End?  he said at last.  Would she not be more comfortable,
as I suggested, at the hotel? 

Margaret hastened to give him reasons.  It is an odd request, but you
know what Helen is and what women in her state are.  He frowned, and
moved irritably.  She has the idea that one night in your house would
give her pleasure and do her good. I think she s right. Being one of
those imaginative girls, the presence of all our books and furniture
soothes her. This is a fact. It is the end of her girlhood. Her last
words to me were,  A beautiful ending.  

 She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons, in fact. 

 Exactly. You have quite understood. It is her last hope of being with
it. 

 I don t agree there, my dear! Helen will have her share of the goods
wherever she goes--possibly more than her share, for you are so fond
of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies, wouldn t
you? and I d raise no objection. I could understand it if it was her old
home, because a home, or a house,  he changed the word, designedly; he
had thought of a telling point-- because a house in which one has once
lived becomes in a sort of way sacred, I don t know why. Associations
and so on. Now Helen has no associations with Howards End, though I
and Charles and Evie have. I do not see why she wants to stay the night
there. She will only catch cold. 

 Leave it that you don t see,  cried Margaret.  Call it fancy. But
realise that fancy is a scientific fact. Helen is fanciful, and wants
to. 

Then he surprised her--a rare occurrence. He shot an unexpected bolt.
 If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two. We shall
never get her out of the house, perhaps. 

 Well?  said Margaret, with the precipice in sight.  And suppose we
don t get her out of the house? Would it matter? She would do no one any
harm. 

Again the irritated gesture.

 No, Henry,  she panted, receding.  I didn t mean that. We will
only trouble Howards End for this one night. I take her to London
to-morrow-- 

 Do you intend to sleep in a damp house, too? 

 She cannot be left alone. 

 That s quite impossible! Madness. You must be here to meet Charles. 

 I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary,
and I have no desire to meet him. 

 Margaret--my Margaret. 

 What has this business to do with Charles? If it concerns me little, it
concerns you less, and Charles not at all. 

 As the future owner of Howards End,  said Mr. Wilcox arching his
fingers,  I should say that it did concern Charles. 

 In what way? Will Helen s condition depreciate the property? 

 My dear, you are forgetting yourself. 

 I think you yourself recommended plain speaking. 

They looked at each other in amazement. The precipice was at their feet
now.

 Helen commands my sympathy,  said Henry.  As your husband, I shall do
all for her that I can, and I have no doubt that she will prove more
sinned against than sinning. But I cannot treat her as if nothing has
happened. I should be false to my position in society if I did. 

She controlled herself for the last time.  No, let us go back to Helen s
request,  she said.  It is unreasonable, but the request of an unhappy
girl. Tomorrow she will go to Germany, and trouble society no longer.
To-night she asks to sleep in your empty house--a house which you do not
care about, and which you have not occupied for over a year. May she?
Will you give my sister leave? Will you forgive her as you hope to be
forgiven, and as you have actually been forgiven? Forgive her for one
night only. That will be enough. 

 As I have actually been forgiven--? 

 Never mind for the moment what I mean by that,  said Margaret.  Answer
my question. 

Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him. If so, he blotted
it out. Straight from his fortress he answered:  I seem rather
unaccommodating, but I have some experience of life, and know how one
thing leads to another. I am afraid that your sister had better sleep
at the hotel. I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to
consider. I am sorry, but see that she leaves my house at once. 

 You have mentioned Mrs. Wilcox. 

 I beg your pardon? 

 A rare occurrence. In reply, may I mention Mrs. Bast? 

 You have not been yourself all day,  said Henry, and rose from his seat
with face unmoved. Margaret rushed at him and seized both his hands. She
was transfigured.

 Not any more of this!  she cried.  You shall see the connection if it
kills you, Henry! You have had a mistress--I forgave you. My sister
has a lover--you drive her from the house. Do you see the connection?
Stupid, hypocritical, cruel--oh, contemptible!--a man who insults his
wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead. A man
who ruins a woman for his pleasure, and casts her off to ruin other men.
And gives bad financial advice, and then says he is not responsible.
These men are you. You can t recognise them, because you cannot connect.
I ve had enough of your unneeded kindness. I ve spoilt you long enough.
All your life you have been spoiled. Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you. No one has
ever told what you are--muddled, criminally muddled. Men like you use
repentance as a blind, so don t repent. Only say to yourself,  What
Helen has done, I ve done.  

 The two cases are different,  Henry stammered. His real retort was
not quite ready. His brain was still in a whirl, and he wanted a little
longer.

 In what way different? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox, Helen only
herself. You remain in society, Helen can t. You have had only pleasure,
she may die. You have the insolence to talk to me of differences,
Henry? 

Oh, the uselessness of it! Henry s retort came.

 I perceive you are attempting blackmail. It is scarcely a pretty weapon
for a wife to use against her husband. My rule through life has been
never to pay the least attention to threats, and I can only repeat
what I said before: I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at
Howards End. 

Margaret loosed his hands. He went into the house, wiping first one and
then the other on his handkerchief. For a little she stood looking at
the Six Hills, tombs of warriors, breasts of the spring. Then she passed
out into what was now the evening.

Charles and Tibby met at Ducie Street, where the latter was staying.
Their interview was short and absurd. They had nothing in common but the
English language, and tried by its help to express what neither of them
understood. Charles saw in Helen the family foe. He had singled her out
as the most dangerous of the Schlegels, and, angry as he was, looked
forward to telling his wife how right he had been. His mind was made up
at once; the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them
farther. If occasion offered she might be married to a villain, or,
possibly, to a fool. But this was a concession to morality, it formed
no part of his main scheme. Honest and hearty was Charles s dislike, and
the past spread itself out very clearly before him; hatred is a skilful
compositor. As if they were heads in a note-book, he ran through all
the incidents of the Schlegels  campaign: the attempt to compromise his
brother, his mother s legacy, his father s marriage, the introduction
of the furniture, the unpacking of the same. He had not yet heard of the
request to sleep at Howards End; that was to be their master-stroke and
the opportunity for his. But he already felt that Howards End was the
objective, and, though he disliked the house, was determined to defend
it.

Tibby, on the other hand, had no opinions. He stood above the
conventions: his sister had a right to do what she thought right. It is
not difficult to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages
among them; men can always be more unconventional than women, and a
bachelor of independent means need encounter no difficulties at all.
Unlike Charles, Tibby had money enough; his ancestors had earned it for
him, and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to
move into another. His was the leisure without sympathy--an attitude as
fatal as the strenuous; a little cold culture may be raised on it, but
no art. His sisters had seen the family danger, and had never forgotten
to discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea. Tibby gave
all the praise to himself, and so despised the struggling and the
submerged.

Hence the absurdity of the interview; the gulf between them was economic
as well as spiritual. But several facts passed; Charles pressed for them
with an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand. On what
date had Helen gone abroad? To whom? (Charles was anxious to fasten the
scandal on Germany.) Then, changing his tactics, he said roughly:  I
suppose you realise that you are your sister s protector? 

 In what sense? 

 If a man played about with my sister, I d send a bullet through him,
but perhaps you don t mind. 

 I mind very much,  protested Tibby.

 Who d ye suspect, then? Speak out man. One always suspects some one. 

 No one. I don t think so.  Involuntarily he blushed. He had remembered
the scene in his Oxford rooms.

 You are hiding something,  said Charles. As interviews go, he got the
best of this one.  When you saw her last, did she mention any one s
name? Yes or no!  he thundered, so that Tibby started.

 In my rooms she mentioned some friends, called the Basts. 

 Who are the Basts? 

 People--friends of hers at Evie s wedding. 

 I don t remember. But, by great Scott, I do! My aunt told me about some
rag-tag. Was she full of them when you saw her? Is there a man? Did she
speak of the man? Or--look here--have you had any dealings with him? 

Tibby was silent. Without intending it, he had betrayed his sister s
confidence; he was not enough interested in human life to see where
things will lead to. He had a strong regard for honesty, and his word,
once given, had always been kept up to now. He was deeply vexed, not
only for the harm he had done Helen, but for the flaw he had discovered
in his own equipment.

 I see--you are in his confidence. They met at your rooms. Oh, what a
family, what a family! God help the poor pater-- 

And Tibby found himself alone.

Leonard--he would figure at length in a newspaper report, but that
evening he did not count for much. The foot of the tree was in shadow,
since the moon was still hidden behind the house. But above, to right,
to left, down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming. Leonard
seemed not a man, but a cause.

Perhaps it was Helen s way of falling in love--a curious way to
Margaret, whose agony and whose contempt of Henry were yet imprinted
with his image. Helen forgot people. They were husks that had enclosed
her emotion. She could pity, or sacrifice herself, or have instincts,
but had she ever loved in the noblest way, where man and woman, having
lost themselves in sex, desire to lose sex itself in comradeship?

Margaret wondered, but said no word of blame. This was Helen s evening.
Troubles enough lay ahead of her--the loss of friends and of social
advantages, the agony, the supreme agony, of motherhood, which is not
even yet a matter of common knowledge. For the present let the moon
shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently, dying away
from the gale of the day, and let the earth, that brings increase, bring
peace. Not even to herself dare she blame Helen.

She could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything
or nothing. Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and
group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen.
The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that
morality is not speaking. Christ was evasive when they questioned Him.
It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.

This was Helen s evening--won at what cost, and not to be marred by the
sorrows of others. Of her own tragedy Margaret never uttered a word.

 One isolates,  said Helen slowly.  I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other
forces that were pulling Leonard downhill. Consequently, I was full of
pity, and almost of revenge. For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only, and
so, when your letters came-- 

 I need never have written them,  sighed Margaret.  They never shielded
Henry. How hopeless it is to tidy away the past, even for others! 

 I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts. 

 Looking back, that was wrong of me. 

 Looking back, darling, I know that it was right. It is right to save
the man whom one loves. I am less enthusiastic about justice now. But we
both thought you wrote at his dictation. It seemed the last touch of his
callousness. Being very much wrought up by this time--and Mrs. Bast
was upstairs. I had not seen her, and had talked for a long time to
Leonard--I had snubbed him for no reason, and that should have warned me
I was in danger. So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an
explanation. He said that he guessed the explanation--he knew of it, and
you mustn t know. I pressed him to tell me. He said no one must know; it
was something to do with his wife. Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast
and Miss Schlegel. I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me
when I saw his eyes, and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two
ways, not one. I drew him to me. I made him tell me. I felt very lonely
myself. He is not to blame. He would have gone on worshipping me. I want
never to see him again, though it sounds appalling. I wanted to give him
money and feel finished. Oh, Meg, the little that is known about these
things! 

She laid her face against the tree.

 The little, too, that is known about growth! Both times it was
loneliness, and the night, and panic afterwards. Did Leonard grow out of
Paul? 

Margaret did not speak for a moment. So tired was she that her attention
had actually wandered to the teeth--the teeth that had been thrust into
the tree s bark to medicate it. From where she sat she could see them
gleam. She had been trying to count them.  Leonard is a better growth
than madness,  she said.  I was afraid that you would react against Paul
until you went over the verge. 

 I did react until I found poor Leonard. I am steady now. I shan t ever
like your Henry, dearest Meg, or even speak kindly about him, but all
that blinding hate is over. I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any
more. I understand how you married him, and you will now be very happy. 

Margaret did not reply.

 Yes,  repeated Helen, her voice growing more tender,  I do at last
understand. 

 Except Mrs. Wilcox, dearest, no one understands our little movements. 

 Because in death--I agree. 

 Not quite. I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that
woman s mind. She knows everything. She is everything. She is the house,
and the tree that leans over it. People have their own deaths as well
as their own lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall
differ in our nothingness. I cannot believe that knowledge such as hers
will perish with knowledge such as mine. She knew about realities. She
knew when people were in love, though she was not in the room. I don t
doubt that she knew when Henry deceived her. 

 Good-night, Mrs. Wilcox,  called a voice.

 Oh, good-night, Miss Avery. 

 Why should Miss Avery work for us?  Helen murmured.

 Why, indeed? 

Miss Avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided
it from the farm. An old gap, which Mr. Wilcox had filled up, had
reappeared, and her track through the dew followed the path that he had
turfed over, when he improved the garden and made it possible for games.

 This is not quite our house yet,  said Helen.  When Miss Avery called,
I felt we are only a couple of tourists. 

 We shall be that everywhere, and for ever. 

 But affectionate tourists. 

 But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home. 

 I can t pretend very long,  said Helen.  Sitting under this tree one
forgets, but I know that to-morrow I shall see the moon rise out of
Germany. Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case. Unless
you will come with me. 

Margaret thought for a moment. In the past year she had grown so fond
of England that to leave it was a real grief. Yet what detained her? No
doubt Henry would pardon her outburst, and go on blustering and muddling
into a ripe old age. But what was the good? She had just as soon vanish
from his mind.

 Are you serious in asking me, Helen? Should I get on with your Monica? 

 You would not, but I am serious in asking you. 

 Still, no more plans now. And no more reminiscences. 

They were silent for a little. It was Helen s evening.

The present flowed by them like a stream. The tree rustled. It had made
music before they were born, and would continue after their deaths,
but its song was of the moment. The moment had passed. The tree rustled
again. Their senses were sharpened, and they seemed to apprehend life.
Life passed. The tree rustled again.

 Sleep now,  said Margaret.

The peace of the country was entering into her. It has no commerce with
memory, and little with hope. Least of all is it concerned with the
hopes of the next five minutes. It is the peace of the present, which
passes understanding. Its murmur came  now,  and  now  once more as they
trod the gravel, and  now,  as the moonlight fell upon their father s
sword. They passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless iterations
fell asleep. The house had enshadowed the tree at first, but as the moon
rose higher the two disentangled, and were clear for a few moments
at midnight. Margaret awoke and looked into the garden. How
incomprehensible that Leonard Bast should have won her this night of
peace! Was he also part of Mrs. Wilcox s mind?

Far different was Leonard s development. The months after Oniton,
whatever minor troubles they might bring him, were all overshadowed by
Remorse. When Helen looked back she could philosophise, or she could
look into the future and plan for her child. But the father saw nothing
beyond his own sin. Weeks afterwards, in the midst of other occupations,
he would suddenly cry out,  Brute--you brute, I couldn t have--  and be
rent into two people who held dialogues. Or brown rain would descend,
blotting out faces and the sky. Even Jacky noticed the change in him.
Most terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep. Sometimes
he was happy at first, but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him
and weighing down his thoughts when they would move. Or little irons
scorched his body. Or a sword stabbed him. He would sit at the edge of
his bed, holding his heart and moaning,  Oh what SHALL I do, whatever
SHALL I do?  Nothing brought ease. He could put distance between him and
the trespass, but it grew in his soul.

Remorse is not among the eternal verities. The Greeks were right to
dethrone her. Her action is too capricious, as though the Erinyes
selected for punishment only certain men and certain sins. And of all
means to regeneration Remorse is surely the most wasteful. It cuts away
healthy tissues with the poisoned. It is a knife that probes far deeper
than the evil. Leonard was driven straight through its torments and
emerged pure, but enfeebled--a better man, who would never lose control
of himself again, but also a smaller man, who had less to control. Nor
did purity mean peace. The use of the knife can become a habit as hard
to shake off as passion itself, and Leonard continued to start with a
cry out of dreams.

He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth. It never
occurred to him that Helen was to blame. He forgot the intensity of
their talk, the charm that had been lent him by sincerity, the magic
of Oniton under darkness and of the whispering river. Helen loved the
absolute. Leonard had been ruined absolutely, and had appeared to her
as a man apart, isolated from the world. A real man, who cared for
adventure and beauty, who desired to live decently and pay his way, who
could have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut
car that was crushing him. Memories of Evie s wedding had warped
her, the starched servants, the yards of uneaten food, the rustle of
overdressed women, motor-cars oozing grease on the gravel, a pretentious
band. She had tasted the lees of this on her arrival; in the darkness,
after failure, they intoxicated her. She and the victim seemed alone in
a world of unreality, and she loved him absolutely, perhaps for half an
hour.

In the morning she was gone. The note that she left, tender and
hysterical in tone, and intended to be most kind, hurt her lover
terribly. It was as if some work of art had been broken by him, some
picture in the National Gallery slashed out of its frame. When he
recalled her talents and her social position, he felt that the first
passer-by had a right to shoot him down. He was afraid of the waitress
and the porters at the railway-station. He was afraid at first of his
wife, though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness,
and to think,  There is nothing to choose between us, after all. 

The expedition to Shropshire crippled the Basts permanently. Helen
in her flight forgot to settle the hotel bill, and took their return
tickets away with her; they had to pawn Jacky s bangles to get home, and
the smash came a few days afterwards. It is true that Helen offered him
five thousand pounds, but such a sum meant nothing to him. He could not
see that the girl was desperately righting herself, and trying to save
something out of the disaster, if it was only five thousand pounds. But
he had to live somehow. He turned to his family, and degraded himself to
a professional beggar. There was nothing else for him to do.

 A letter from Leonard,  thought Blanche, his sister;  and after all
this time.  She hid it, so that her husband should not see, and when he
had gone to his work read it with some emotion, and sent the prodigal a
little money out of her dress allowance.

 A letter from Leonard!  said the other sister, Laura, a few days later.
She showed it to her husband. He wrote a cruel, insolent reply, but sent
more money than Blanche, so Leonard soon wrote to him again.

And during the winter the system was developed.

Leonard realised that they need never starve, because it would be too
painful for his relatives. Society is based on the family, and the
clever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely. Without a generous thought
on either side, pounds and pounds passed. The donors disliked Leonard,
and he grew to hate them intensely. When Laura censured his immoral
marriage, he thought bitterly,  She minds that! What would she say if
she knew the truth?  When Blanche s husband offered him work, he found
some pretext for avoiding it. He had wanted work keenly at Oniton, but
too much anxiety had shattered him, he was joining the unemployable.
When his brother, the lay-reader, did not reply to a letter, he wrote
again, saying that he and Jacky would come down to his village on foot.
He did not intend this as blackmail. Still the brother sent a postal
order, and it became part of the system. And so passed his winter and
his spring.

In the horror there are two bright spots. He never confused the past. He
remained alive, and blessed are those who live, if it is only to a sense
of sinfulness. The anodyne of muddledom, by which most men blur and
blend their mistakes, never passed Leonard s lips--

         And if I drink oblivion of a day,
         So shorten I the stature of my soul. 

It is a hard saying, and a hard man wrote it, but it lies at the root of
all character.

And the other bright spot was his tenderness for Jacky. He pitied her
with nobility now--not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a
woman through thick and thin. He tried to be less irritable. He wondered
what her hungry eyes desired--nothing that she could express, or that
he or any man could give her. Would she ever receive the justice that is
mercy--the justice for by-products that the world is too busy to bestow?
She was fond of flowers, generous with money, and not revengeful. If she
had borne him a child he might have cared for her. Unmarried, Leonard
would never have begged; he would have flickered out and died. But the
whole of life is mixed. He had to provide for Jacky, and went down dirty
paths that she might have a few feathers and the dishes of food that
suited her.

One day he caught sight of Margaret and her brother. He was in St.
Paul s. He had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly
to see a picture that had educated him in former years. But the light
was bad, the picture ill placed, and Time and judgment were inside him
now. Death alone still charmed him, with her lap of poppies, on which
all men shall sleep. He took one glance, and turned aimlessly away
towards a chair. Then down the nave he saw Miss Schlegel and her
brother. They stood in the fairway of passengers, and their faces were
extremely grave. He was perfectly certain that they were in trouble
about their sister.

Once outside--and he fled immediately--he wished that he had spoken
to them. What was his life? What were a few angry words, or even
imprisonment? He had done wrong--that was the true terror. Whatever they
might know, he would tell them everything he knew. He re-entered St.
Paul s. But they had moved in his absence, and had gone to lay their
difficulties before Mr. Wilcox and Charles.

The sight of Margaret turned remorse into new channels. He desired to
confess, and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature, which
is about to lose the essence of human intercourse, it did not take
an ignoble form. He did not suppose that confession would bring him
happiness. It was rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle. So
does the suicide yearn. The impulses are akin, and the crime of suicide
lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave
behind. Confession need harm no one--it can satisfy that test--and
though it was un-English, and ignored by our Anglican cathedral, Leonard
had a right to decide upon it.

Moreover, he trusted Margaret. He wanted her hardness now. That cold,
intellectual nature of hers would be just, if unkind. He would do
whatever she told him, even if he had to see Helen. That was the supreme
punishment she would exact. And perhaps she would tell him how Helen
was. That was the supreme reward.

He knew nothing about Margaret, not even whether she was married to Mr.
Wilcox, and tracking her out took several days. That evening he
toiled through the wet to Wickham Place, where the new flats were now
appearing. Was he also the cause of their move? Were they expelled from
society on his account? Thence to a public library, but could find no
satisfactory Schlegel in the directory. On the morrow he searched again.
He hung about outside Mr. Wilcox s office at lunch time, and, as the
clerks came out said,  Excuse me, sir, but is your boss married?  Most
of them stared, some said,  What s that to you?  but one, who had not
yet acquired reticence, told him what he wished. Leonard could not learn
the private address. That necessitated more trouble with directories
and tubes. Ducie Street was not discovered till the Monday, the day
that Margaret and her husband went down on their hunting expedition to
Howards End.

He called at about four o clock. The weather had changed, and the
sun shone gaily on the ornamental steps--black and white marble in
triangles. Leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell. He
felt in curious health; doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside
his body, and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed, with his
back propped against the wall. When the parlourmaid came he could not
see her face; the brown rain had descended suddenly.

 Does Mrs. Wilcox live here?  he asked.

 She s out,  was the answer.

 When will she be back? 

 I ll ask,  said the parlourmaid.

Margaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name
should ever be rebuffed. Putting the door on the chain--for Leonard s
appearance demanded this--she went through to the smoking-room, which
was occupied by Tibby. Tibby was asleep. He had had a good lunch.
Charles Wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview. He
said drowsily:  I don t know. Hilton. Howards End. Who is it? 

 I ll ask, sir. 

 No, don t bother. 

 They have taken the car to Howards End,  said the parlourmaid to
Leonard.

He thanked her, and asked whereabouts that place was.

 You appear to want to know a good deal,  she remarked. But Margaret had
forbidden her to be mysterious. She told him against her better judgment
that Howards End was in Hertfordshire.

 Is it a village, please? 

 Village! It s Mr. Wilcox s private house--at least, it s one of them.
Mrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there. Hilton is the village. 

 Yes. And when will they be back? 

 Mr. Schlegel doesn t know. We can t know everything, can we?  She
shut him out, and went to attend to the telephone, which was ringing
furiously.

He loitered away another night of agony. Confession grew more difficult.
As soon as possible he went to bed. He watched a patch of moonlight
cross the floor of their lodging, and, as sometimes happens when the
mind is overtaxed, he fell asleep for the rest of the room, but kept
awake for the patch of moonlight. Horrible! Then began one of those
disintegrating dialogues. Part of him said:  Why horrible? It s ordinary
light from the moon.   But it moves.   So does the moon.   But it is a
clenched fist.   Why not?   But it is going to touch me.   Let it.  And,
seeming to gather motion, the patch ran up his blanket. Presently a
blue snake appeared; then another parallel to it.  Is there life in the
moon?   Of course.   But I thought it was uninhabited.   Not by Time,
Death, Judgment, and the smaller snakes.   Smaller snakes!  said Leonard
indignantly and aloud.  What a notion!  By a rending effort of the
will he woke the rest of the room up. Jacky, the bed, their food, their
clothes on the chair, gradually entered his consciousness, and the
horror vanished outwards, like a ring that is spreading through water.

 I say, Jacky, I m going out for a bit. 

She was breathing regularly. The patch of light fell clear of the
striped blanket, and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet.
Why had he been afraid? He went to the window, and saw that the moon
was descending through a clear sky. He saw her volcanoes, and the bright
expanses that a gracious error has named seas. They paled, for the sun,
who had lit them up, was coming to light the earth. Sea of Serenity, Sea
of Tranquillity, Ocean of the Lunar Storms, merged into one lucent drop,
itself to slip into the sempiternal dawn. And he had been afraid of the
moon!

He dressed among the contending lights, and went through his money. It
was running low again, but enough for a return ticket to Hilton. As it
clinked, Jacky opened her eyes.

 Hullo, Len! What ho, Len! 

 What ho, Jacky! see you again later. 

She turned over and slept.

The house was unlocked, their landlord being a salesman at Covent
Garden. Leonard passed out and made his way down to the station. The
train, though it did not start for an hour, was already drawn up at the
end of the platform, and he lay down in it and slept. With the first
jolt he was in daylight; they had left the gateways of King s Cross,
and were under blue sky. Tunnels followed, and after each the sky grew
bluer, and from the embankment at Finsbury Park he had his first sight
of the sun. It rolled along behind the eastern smokes--a wheel, whose
fellow was the descending moon--and as yet it seemed the servant of the
blue sky, not its lord. He dozed again. Over Tewin Water it was day. To
the left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches; to the right
Leonard saw up into the Tewin Woods and towards the church, with its
wild legend of immortality. Six forest trees--that is a fact--grow out
of one of the graves in Tewin churchyard. The grave s occupant--that is
the legend--is an atheist, who declared that if God existed, six forest
trees would grow out of her grave. These things in Hertfordshire; and
farther afield lay the house of a hermit--Mrs. Wilcox had known him--who
barred himself up, and wrote prophecies, and gave all he had to the
poor. While, powdered in between, were the villas of business men, who
saw life more steadily, though with the steadiness of the half-closed
eye. Over all the sun was streaming, to all the birds were singing, to
all the primroses were yellow, and the speedwell blue, and the country,
however they interpreted her, was uttering her cry of  now.  She did
not free Leonard yet, and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the
train drew up at Hilton. But remorse had become beautiful.

Hilton was asleep, or at the earliest, breakfasting. Leonard noticed the
contrast when he stepped out of it into the country. Here men had been
up since dawn. Their hours were ruled, not by a London office, but by
the movements of the crops and the sun. That they were men of the finest
type only the sentimentalists can declare. But they kept to the life of
daylight. They are England s hope. Clumsily they carry forward the torch
of the sun, until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up. Half
clodhopper, half board-school prig, they can still throw back to a
nobler stock, and breed yeomen.

At the chalk pit a motor passed him. In it was another type, whom Nature
favours--the Imperial. Healthy, ever in motion, it hopes to inherit the
earth. It breeds as quickly as the yeoman, and as soundly; strong is the
temptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman, who carries his country s
virtue overseas. But the Imperialist is not what he thinks or seems. He
is a destroyer. He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism, and though his
ambitions may be fulfilled, the earth that he inherits will be grey.

To Leonard, intent on his private sin, there came the conviction of
innate goodness elsewhere. It was not the optimism which he had been
taught at school. Again and again must the drums tap, and the goblins
stalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial. It
was rather paradoxical, and arose from his sorrow. Death destroys a man,
but the idea of death saves him--that is the best account of it that has
yet been given. Squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in
us, and strengthen the wings of love. They can beckon; it is not certain
that they will, for they are not love s servants. But they can beckon,
and the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him.

As he approached the house all thought stopped. Contradictory notions
stood side by side in his mind. He was terrified but happy, ashamed,
but had done no sin. He knew the confession:  Mrs. Wilcox, I have done
wrong,  but sunrise had robbed its meaning, and he felt rather on a
supreme adventure.

He entered a garden, steadied himself against a motor-car that he found
in it, found a door open and entered a house. Yes, it would be very
easy. From a room to the left he heard voices, Margaret s amongst them.
His own name was called aloud, and a man whom he had never seen said,
 Oh, is he there? I am not surprised. I now thrash him within an inch of
his life. 

 Mrs. Wilcox,  said Leonard,  I have done wrong. 

The man took him by the collar and cried,  Bring me a stick.  Women were
screaming. A stick, very bright, descended. It hurt him, not where it
descended, but in the heart. Books fell over him in a shower. Nothing
had sense.

 Get some water,  commanded Charles, who had all through kept very calm.
 He s shamming. Of course I only used the blade. Here, carry him out
into the air. 

Thinking that he understood these things, Margaret obeyed him. They laid
Leonard, who was dead, on the gravel; Helen poured water over him.

 That s enough,  said Charles.

 Yes, murder s enough,  said Miss Avery, coming out of the house with
the sword.

down on their hunting expedition to howards end   he called at about four o clock  the weather had changed  and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental steps  black and white marble in triangles  leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell  he felt in curious health  doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body  and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed  with his back propped against the wall  when the parlourmaid came he could not see her face  the brown rain had descended suddenly    does mrs  wilcox live here   he asked    she s out   was the answer    when will she be back     i ll ask   said the parlourmaid   margaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed  putting the door on the chain  for leonard s appearance demanded this  she went through to the smoking room  which was occupied by tibby  tibby was asleep  he had had a good lunch  charles wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview  he said drowsily   i don t know  hilton  howards end  who is it     i ll ask  sir     no  don t bother     they have taken the car to howards end   said the parlourmaid to leonard   he thanked her  and asked whereabouts that place was    you appear to want to know a good deal   she remarked  but margaret had forbidden her to be mysterious  she told him against her better judgment that howards end was in hertfordshire    is it a village  please     village  it s mr  wilcox s private house  at least  it s one of them  mrs  wilcox keeps her furniture there  hilton is the village     yes  and when will they be back     mr  schlegel doesn t know  we can t know everything  can we   she shut him out  and went to attend to the telephone  which was ringing furiously   he loitered away another night of agony  confession grew more difficult  as soon as possible he went to bed  he watched a patch of moonlight cross the floor of their lodging  and  as sometimes happens when the mind is overtaxed  he fell asleep for the rest of the room  but kept awake for the patch of moonlight  horrible  then began one of those disintegrating dialogues  part of him said   why horrible  it s ordinary light from the moon    but it moves    so does the moon    but it is a clenched fist    why not    but it is going to touch me    let it   and  seeming to gather motion  the patch ran up his blanket  presently a blue snake appeared  then another parallel to it   is there life in the moon    of course    but i thought it was uninhabited    not by time  death  judgment  and the smaller snakes    smaller snakes   said leonard indignantly and aloud   what a notion   by a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the room up  jacky  the bed  their food  their clothes on the chair  gradually entered his consciousness  and the horror vanished outwards  like a ring that is spreading through water    i say  jacky  i m going out for a bit    she was breathing regularly  the patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket  and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet  why had he been afraid  he went to the window  and saw that the moon was descending through a clear sky  he saw her volcanoes  and the bright expanses that a gracious error has named seas  they paled  for the sun  who had lit them up  was coming to light the earth  sea of serenity  sea of tranquillity  ocean of the lunar storms  merged into one lucent drop  itself to slip into the sempiternal dawn  and he had been afraid of the moon   he dressed among the contending lights  and went through his money  it was running low again  but enough for a return ticket to hilton  as it clinked  jacky opened her eyes    hullo  len  what ho  len     what ho  jacky  see you again later    she turned over and slept   the house was unlocked  their landlord being a salesman at covent garden  leonard passed out and made his way down to the station  the train  though it did not start for an hour  was already drawn up at the end of the platform  and he lay down in it and slept  with the first jolt he was in daylight  they had left the gateways of king s cross  and were under blue sky  tunnels followed  and after each the sky grew bluer  and from the embankment at finsbury park he had his first sight of the sun  it rolled along behind the eastern smokes  a wheel  whose fellow was the

leonard saw up into the tewin woods and towards the church  with its wild legend of immortality  six forest trees  that is a fact  grow out of one of the graves in tewin churchyard  the grave s occupant  that is the legend  is an atheist  who declared that if god existed  six forest trees would grow out of her grave  these things in hertfordshire  and farther afield lay the house of a hermit  mrs  wilcox had known him  who barred himself up  and wrote prophecies  and gave all he had to the poor  while  powdered in between  were the villas of business men  who saw life more steadily  though with the steadiness of the half closed eye  over all the sun was streaming  to all the birds were singing  to all the primroses were yellow  and the speedwell blue  and the country  however they interpreted her  was uttering her cry of  now   she did not free leonard yet  and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at hilton  but remorse had become beautiful   hilton was asleep  or at the earliest  breakfasting  leonard noticed the contrast when he stepped out of it into the country  here men had been up since dawn  their hours were ruled  not by a london office  but by the movements of the crops and the sun  that they were men of the finest type only the sentimentalists can declare  but they kept to the life of daylight  they are england s hope  clumsily they

strong is the temptation to acclaim it as a super yeoman  who carries his country s virtue overseas  but the imperialist is not what he thinks or seems  he is a destroyer  he prepares the way for cosmopolitanism  and though his ambitions may be fulfilled  the earth that he inherits will be grey   to leonard  intent on his private sin  there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere  it was not the optimism which he had been taught at school  again and again must the drums tap  and the goblins stalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial  it was rather paradoxical  and arose from his sorrow  death destroys a man  but the idea of death saves him  that is the best account of it that has yet been given  squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is

41,41,8464,8531,8599,"

When Charles left Ducie Street he had caught the first train home, but
had no inkling of the newest development until late at night. Then
his father, who had dined alone, sent for him, and in very grave tones
inquired for Margaret.

 I don t know where she is, pater  said Charles.  Dolly kept back dinner
nearly an hour for her. 

 Tell me when she comes in. 

Another hour passed. The servants went to bed, and Charles visited his
father again, to receive further instructions. Mrs. Wilcox had still not
returned.

 I ll sit up for her as late as you like, but she can hardly be coming.
Isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel? 

 Perhaps,  said Mr. Wilcox thoughtfully-- perhaps. 

 Can I do anything for you, sir? 

 Not to-night, my boy. 

Mr. Wilcox liked being called sir. He raised his eyes, and gave his son
more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured. He saw Charles
as little boy and strong man in one. Though his wife had proved unstable
his children were left to him.

After midnight he tapped on Charles s door.  I can t sleep,  he said.  I
had better have a talk with you and get it over. 

He complained of the heat. Charles took him out into the garden, and
they paced up and down in their dressing-gowns. Charles became very
quiet as the story unrolled; he had known all along that Margaret was as
bad as her sister.

 She will feel differently in the morning,  said Mr. Wilcox, who had
of course said nothing about Mrs. Bast.  But I cannot let this kind of
thing continue without comment. I am morally certain that she is with
her sister at Howards End. The house is mine--and, Charles, it will be
yours--and when I say that no one is to live there, I mean that no one
is to live there. I won t have it.  He looked angrily at the moon.
 To my mind this question is connected with something far greater, the
rights of property itself. 

 Undoubtedly,  said Charles.

Mr. Wilcox linked his arm in his son s, but somehow liked him less as
he told him more.  I don t want you to conclude that my wife and I had
anything of the nature of a quarrel. She was only overwrought, as who
would not be? I shall do what I can for Helen, but on the understanding
that they clear out of the house at once. Do you see? That is a sine qua
non. 

 Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car? 

 Eight or earlier. Say that you are acting as my representative, and, of
course, use no violence, Charles. 

On the morrow, as Charles returned, leaving Leonard dead upon the
gravel, it did not seem to him that he had used violence. Death was
due to heart disease. His stepmother herself had said so, and even Miss
Avery had acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword. On his
way through the village he informed the police, who thanked him, and
said there must be an inquest. He found his father in the garden shading
his eyes from the sun.

 It has been pretty horrible,  said Charles gravely.  They were there,
and they had the man up there with them too. 

 What--what man? 

 I told you last night. His name was Bast. 

 My God! is it possible?  said Mr. Wilcox.  In your mother s house!
Charles, in your mother s house! 

 I know, pater. That was what I felt. As a matter of fact, there is
no need to trouble about the man. He was in the last stages of heart
disease, and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went
off. The police are seeing about it at this moment. 

Mr. Wilcox listened attentively.

 I got up there--oh, it couldn t have been more than half-past seven.
The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them. They were still upstairs.
I waited in the drawing-room. We were all moderately civil and
collected, though I had my suspicions. I gave them your message, and
Mrs. Wilcox said,  Oh yes, I see; yes,  in that way of hers. 

 Nothing else? 

 I promised to tell you,  with her love,  that she was going to Germany
with her sister this evening. That was all we had time for. 

Mr. Wilcox seemed relieved.

 Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding, for suddenly
Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his name. I recognised it, and I went for him
in the hall. Was I right, pater? I thought things were going a little
too far. 

 Right, my dear boy? I don t know. But you would have been no son of
mine if you hadn t. Then did he just--just--crumple up as you said?  He
shrunk from the simple word.

 He caught hold of the bookcase, which came down over him. So I merely
put the sword down and carried him into the garden. We all thought he
was shamming. However, he s dead right enough. Awful business! 

 Sword?  cried his father, with anxiety in his voice.  What sword? Whose
sword? 

 A sword of theirs. 

 What were you doing with it? 

 Well, didn t you see, pater, I had to snatch up the first thing handy.
I hadn t a riding-whip or stick. I caught him once or twice over the
shoulders with the flat of their old German sword. 

 Then what? 

 He pulled over the bookcase, as I said, and fell,  said Charles, with
a sigh. It was no fun doing errands for his father, who was never quite
satisfied.

 But the real cause was heart disease? Of that you re sure? 

 That or a fit. However, we shall hear more than enough at the inquest
on such unsavoury topics. 

They went in to breakfast. Charles had a racking headache, consequent on
motoring before food. He was also anxious about the future, reflecting
that the police must detain Helen and Margaret for the inquest and
ferret the whole thing out. He saw himself obliged to leave Hilton. One
could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal--it was not fair on
one s wife. His comfort was that the pater s eyes were opened at last.
There would be a horrible smash-up, and probably a separation from
Margaret; then they would all start again, more as they had been in his
mother s time.

 I think I ll go round to the police-station,  said his father when
breakfast was over.

 What for?  cried Dolly, who had still not been  told. 

 Very well, sir. Which car will you have? 

 I think I ll walk. 

 It s a good half-mile,  said Charles, stepping into the garden.  The
sun s very hot for April. Shan t I take you up, and then, perhaps, a
little spin round by Tewin? 

 You go on as if I didn t know my own mind,  said Mr. Wilcox fretfully.
Charles hardened his mouth.  You young fellows  one idea is to get into
a motor. I tell you, I want to walk; I m very fond of walking. 

 Oh, all right; I m about the house if you want me for anything. I
thought of not going up to the office to-day, if that is your wish. 

 It is, indeed, my boy,  said Mr. Wilcox, and laid a hand on his sleeve.

Charles did not like it; he was uneasy about his father, who did not
seem himself this morning. There was a petulant touch about him--more
like a woman. Could it be that he was growing old? The Wilcoxes were not
lacking in affection; they had it royally, but they did not know how to
use it. It was the talent in the napkin, and, for a warm-hearted man,
Charles had conveyed very little joy. As he watched his father shuffling
up the road, he had a vague regret--a wish that something had been
different somewhere--a wish (though he did not express it thus) that
he had been taught to say  I  in his youth. He meant to make up for
Margaret s defection, but knew that his father had been very happy with
her until yesterday. How had she done it? By some dishonest trick, no
doubt--but how?

Mr. Wilcox reappeared at eleven, looking very tired. There was to be an
inquest on Leonard s body to-morrow, and the police required his son to
attend.

 I expected that,  said Charles.  I shall naturally be the most
important witness there.

Out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with Aunt Juley s illness
and was not even to end with Leonard s death, it seemed impossible
to Margaret that healthy life should re-emerge. Events succeeded in
a logical, yet senseless, train. People lost their humanity, and took
values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing-cards. It was natural
that Henry should do this and cause Helen to do that, and then think
her wrong for doing it; natural that she herself should think him wrong;
natural that Leonard should want to know how Helen was, and come, and
Charles be angry with him for coming--natural, but unreal. In this
jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true selves? Here
Leonard lay dead in the garden, from natural causes; yet life was a
deep, deep river, death a blue sky, life was a house, death a wisp of
hay, a flower, a tower, life and death were anything and everything,
except this ordered insanity, where the king takes the queen, and the
ace the king. Ah, no; there was beauty and adventure behind, such as the
man at her feet had yearned for; there was hope this side of the grave;
there were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now. As
a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she, from the turmoil
and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the diviner wheels.

And Helen, dumb with fright, but trying to keep calm for the child s
sake, and Miss Avery, calm, but murmuring tenderly,  No one ever told
the lad he ll have a child --they also reminded her that horror is not
the end. To what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know, but there
seemed great chance that a child would be born into the world, to take
the great chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers. She
moved through the sunlit garden, gathering narcissi, crimson-eyed and
white. There was nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and
anger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of Leonard should be
folded on his breast and be filled with flowers. Here was the father;
leave it at that. Let Squalor be turned into Tragedy, whose eyes are the
stars, and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn.

And even the influx of officials, even the return of the doctor, vulgar
and acute, could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty. Science
explained people, but could not understand them. After long centuries
among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the
nerves, but this would never give understanding. One could open the
heart to Mr. Mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to
them, for they wanted everything down in black and white, and black and
white was exactly what they were left with.

They questioned her closely about Charles. She never suspected why.
Death had come, and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease.
They asked to see her father s sword. She explained that Charles s anger
was natural, but mistaken. Miserable questions about Leonard followed,
all of which she answered unfalteringly. Then back to Charles again.  No
doubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death,  she said;  but if it wasn t
one thing it would have been another as you know.  At last they thanked
her and took the sword and the body down to Hilton. She began to pick up
the books from the floor.

Helen had gone to the farm. It was the best place for her, since she
had to wait for the inquest. Though, as if things were not hard enough,
Madge and her husband had raised trouble; they did not see why they
should receive the offscourings of Howards End. And, of course, they
were right. The whole world was going to be right, and amply avenge any
brave talk against the conventions.  Nothing matters,  the Schlegels had
said in the past,  except one s self-respect and that of one s friends. 
 When the time came, other things mattered terribly. However, Madge
had yielded, and Helen was assured of peace for one day and night, and
to-morrow she would return to Germany.

As for herself, she determined to go too. No message came from Henry;
perhaps he expected her to apologise. Now that she had time to think
over her own tragedy, she was unrepentant. She neither forgave him
for his behaviour nor wished to forgive him. Her speech to him seemed
perfect. She would not have altered a word. It had to be uttered once in
a life, to adjust the lopsidedness of the world. It was spoken not only
to her husband, but to thousands of men like him--a protest against the
inner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age. Though
he would build up his life without hers, she could not apologise. He had
refused to connect, on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man,
and their love must take the consequences.

No, there was nothing more to be done. They had tried not to go over the
precipice, but perhaps the fall was inevitable. And it comforted her to
think that the future was certainly inevitable; cause and effect would
go jangling forward to some goal doubtless, but to none that she could
imagine. At such moments the soul retires within, to float upon the
bosom of a deeper stream, and has communion with the dead, and sees
the world s glory not diminished, but different in kind to what she
has supposed. She alters her focus until trivial things are blurred.
Margaret had been tending this way all the winter. Leonard s death
brought her to the goal. Alas! that Henry should fade away as reality
emerged, and only her love for him should remain clear, stamped with his
image like the cameos we rescue out of dreams.

With unfaltering eye she traced his future. He would soon present a
healthy mind to the world again, and what did he or the world care if
he was rotten at the core? He would grow into a rich, jolly old man,
at times a little sentimental about women, but emptying his glass
with anyone. Tenacious of power, he would keep Charles and the rest
dependent, and retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age.
He would settle down--though she could not realise this. In her eyes
Henry was always moving and causing others to move, until the ends of
the earth met. But in time he must get too tired to move, and settle
down. What next? The inevitable word. The release of the soul to its
appropriate Heaven.

Would they meet in it? Margaret believed in immortality for herself. An
eternal future had always seemed natural to her. And Henry believed in
it for himself. Yet, would they meet again? Are there not rather endless
levels beyond the grave, as the theory that he had censured teaches?
And his level, whether higher or lower, could it possibly be the same as
hers?

Thus gravely meditating, she was summoned by him. He sent up Crane in
the motor. Other servants passed like water, but the chauffeur remained,
though impertinent and disloyal. Margaret disliked Crane, and he knew
it.

 Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants?  she asked.

 He didn t say, madam. 

 You haven t any note for me? 

 He didn t say, madam. 

After a moment s thought she locked up Howards End. It was pitiable to
see in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever. She
raked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen, and spread the coals
in the gravelled yard. She closed the windows and drew the curtains.
Henry would probably sell the place now.

She was determined not to spare him, for nothing new had happened as far
as they were concerned. Her mood might never have altered from yesterday
evening. He was standing a little outside Charles s gate, and motioned
the car to stop. When his wife got out he said hoarsely:  I prefer to
discuss things with you outside. 

 It will be more appropriate in the road, I am afraid,  said Margaret.
 Did you get my message? 

 What about? 

 I am going to Germany with my sister. I must tell you now that I shall
make it my permanent home. Our talk last night was more important than
you have realised. I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you. 

 I am extremely tired,  said Henry, in injured tones.  I have been
walking about all the morning, and wish to sit down. 

 Certainly, if you will consent to sit on the grass. 

The Great North Road should have been bordered all its length with
glebe. Henry s kind had filched most of it. She moved to the scrap
opposite, wherein were the Six Hills. They sat down on the farther side,
so that they could not be seen by Charles or Dolly.

 Here are your keys,  said Margaret. She tossed them towards him. They
fell on the sunlit slope of grass, and he did not pick them up.

 I have something to tell you,  he said gently.

She knew this superficial gentleness, this confession of hastiness, that
was only intended to enhance her admiration of the male.

 I don t want to hear it,  she replied.  My sister is going to be
ill. My life is going to be with her now. We must manage to build up
something, she and I and her child. 

 Where are you going? 

 Munich. We start after the inquest, if she is not too ill. 

 After the inquest? 

 Yes. 

 Have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be? 

 Yes, heart disease. 

 No, my dear; manslaughter. 

Margaret drove her fingers through the grass. The hill beneath her moved
as if it were alive.

 Manslaughter,  repeated Mr. Wilcox.  Charles may go to prison. I dare
not tell him. I don t know what to do--what to do. I m broken--I m
ended. 

No sudden warmth arose in her. She did not see that to break him was her
only hope. She did not enfold the sufferer in her arms. But all through
that day and the next a new life began to move. The verdict was brought
in. Charles was committed for trial. It was against all reason that he
should be punished, but the law, notwithstanding, sentenced him to three
years  imprisonment. Then Henry s fortress gave way. He could bear no
one but his wife; he shambled up to Margaret afterwards and asked her
to do what she could with him. She did what seemed easiest--she took him
down to recruit at Howards End.

Tom s father was cutting the big meadow. He passed again and again amid
whirring blades and sweet odours of grass, encompassing with narrowing
circles the sacred centre of the field. Tom was negotiating with Helen.
 I haven t any idea,  she replied.  Do you suppose baby may, Meg? 

Margaret put down her work and regarded them absently.  What was that? 
 she asked.

 Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay? 

 I haven t the least notion,  answered Margaret, and took up her work
again.

 Now, Tom, baby is not to stand; he is not to lie on his face; he is not
to lie so that his head wags; he is not to be teased or tickled; and he
is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter. Will you be as
careful as all that? 

Tom held out his arms.

 That child is a wonderful nursemaid,  remarked Margaret.

 He is fond of baby. That s why he does it!  was Helen s answer.
 They re going to be lifelong friends. 

 Starting at the ages of six and one? 

 Of course. It will be a great thing for Tom. 

 It may be a greater thing for baby. 

Fourteen months had passed, but Margaret still stopped at Howards End.
No better plan had occurred to her. The meadow was being recut, the
great red poppies were reopening in the garden. July would follow with
the little red poppies among the wheat, August with the cutting of the
wheat. These little events would become part of her year after year.
Every summer she would fear lest the well should give out, every
winter lest the pipes should freeze; every westerly gale might blow the
wych-elm down and bring the end of all things, and so she could not read
or talk during a westerly gale. The air was tranquil now. She and her
sister were sitting on the remains of Evie s rockery, where the lawn
merged into the field.

 What a time they all are!  said Helen.  What can they be doing inside? 
 Margaret, who was growing less talkative, made no answer. The noise of
the cutter came intermittently, like the breaking of waves. Close by
them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes.

 I wish Henry was out to enjoy this,  said Helen.  This lovely weather
and to be shut up in the house! It s very hard. 

 It has to be,  said Margaret.  The hay fever is his chief objection
against living here, but he thinks it worth while. 

 Meg, is or isn t he ill? I can t make out. 

 Not ill. Eternally tired. He has worked very hard all his life, and
noticed nothing. Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a
thing. 

 I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle. 

 Dreadfully. That is why I wish Dolly had not come, too, to-day. Still,
he wanted them all to come. It has to be. 

 Why does he want them? 

Margaret did not answer.

 Meg, may I tell you something? I like Henry. 

 You d be odd if you didn t,  said Margaret.

 I usen t to. 

 Usen t!  She lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past.
They had crossed it, always excepting Leonard and Charles. They were
building up a new life, obscure, yet gilded with tranquillity. Leonard
was dead; Charles had two years more in prison. One usen t always to see
clearly before that time. It was different now.

 I like Henry because he does worry. 

 And he likes you because you don t. 

Helen sighed. She seemed humiliated, and buried her face in her hands.
After a time she said:  About love,  a transition less abrupt than it
appeared.

Margaret never stopped working.

 I mean a woman s love for a man. I supposed I should hang my life on
to that once, and was driven up and down and about as if something was
worrying through me. But everything is peaceful now; I seem cured. That
Herr Forstmeister, whom Frieda keeps writing about, must be a noble
character, but he doesn t see that I shall never marry him or anyone. It
isn t shame or mistrust of myself. I simply couldn t. I m ended. I used
to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl, and think that for good
or evil love must be the great thing. But it hasn t been; it has been
itself a dream. Do you agree? 

 I do not agree. I do not. 

 I ought to remember Leonard as my lover,  said Helen, stepping down
into the field.  I tempted him, and killed him, and it is surely the
least I can do. I would like to throw out all my heart to Leonard on
such an afternoon as this. But I cannot. It is no good pretending. I
am forgetting him.  Her eyes filled with tears.  How nothing seems to
match--how, my darling, my precious--  She broke off.  Tommy! 

 Yes, please? 

 Baby s not to try and stand.--There s something wanting in me. I see
you loving Henry, and understanding him better daily, and I know
that death wouldn t part you in the least. But I--Is it some awful,
appalling, criminal defect? 

Margaret silenced her. She said:  It is only that people are far more
different than is pretended. All over the world men and women are
worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop.
Here and there they have the matter out, and it comforts them. Don t
fret yourself, Helen. Develop what you have; love your child. I do not
love children. I am thankful to have none. I can play with their beauty
and charm, but that is all--nothing real, not one scrap of what there
ought to be. And others--others go farther still, and move outside
humanity altogether. A place, as well as a person, may catch the glow.
Don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end? It is part of
the battle against sameness. Differences, eternal differences, planted
by God in a single family, so that there may always be colour; sorrow
perhaps, but colour in the daily grey. Then I can t have you worrying
about Leonard. Don t drag in the personal when it will not come. Forget
him. 

 Yes, yes, but what has Leonard got out of life? 

 Perhaps an adventure. 

 Is that enough? 

 Not for us. But for him. 

Helen took up a bunch of grass. She looked at the sorrel, and the red
and white and yellow clover, and the quaker grass, and the daisies, and
the bents that composed it. She raised it to her face.

 Is it sweetening yet?  asked Margaret.

 No, only withered. 

 It will sweeten to-morrow. 

Helen smiled.  Oh, Meg, you are a person,  she said.  Think of the
racket and torture this time last year. But now I couldn t stop unhappy
if I tried. What a change--and all through you! 

 Oh, we merely settled down. You and Henry learnt to understand one
another and to forgive, all through the autumn and the winter. 

 Yes, but who settled us down? 

Margaret did not reply. The scything had begun, and she took off her
pince-nez to watch it.

 You!  cried Helen.  You did it all, sweetest, though you re too stupid
to see. Living here was your plan--I wanted you; he wanted you; and
everyone said it was impossible, but you knew. Just think of our lives
without you, Meg--I and baby with Monica, revolting by theory, he handed
about from Dolly to Evie. But you picked up the pieces, and made us a
home. Can t it strike you--even for a moment--that your life has been
heroic? Can t you remember the two months after Charles s arrest, when
you began to act, and did all? 

 You were both ill at the time,  said Margaret.  I did the obvious
things. I had two invalids to nurse. Here was a house, ready furnished
and empty. It was obvious. I didn t know myself it would turn into a
permanent home. No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the
tangle, but things that I can t phrase have helped me. 

 I hope it will be permanent,  said Helen, drifting away to other
thoughts.

 I think so. There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our
own. 

 All the same, London s creeping. 

She pointed over the meadow--over eight or nine meadows, but at the end
of them was a red rust.

 You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now,  she continued.  I can
see it from the Purbeck Downs. And London is only part of something
else, I m afraid. Life s going to be melted down, all over the world. 

Margaret knew that her sister spoke truly. Howards End, Oniton, the
Purbeck Downs, the Oderberge, were all survivals, and the melting-pot
was being prepared for them. Logically, they had no right to be alive.
One s hope was in the weakness of logic. Were they possibly the earth
beating time?

 Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go strong for ever, 
 she said.  This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred
years. It may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement,
because it will rest on the earth. All the signs are against it now, but
I can t help hoping, and very early in the morning in the garden I feel
that our house is the future as well as the past. 

They turned and looked at it. Their own memories coloured it now,
for Helen s child had been born in the central room of the nine. Then
Margaret said,  Oh, take care--!  for something moved behind the window
of the hall, and the door opened.

 The conclave s breaking at last. I ll go. 

It was Paul.

Helen retreated with the children far into the field. Friendly voices
greeted her. Margaret rose, to encounter a man with a heavy black
moustache.

 My father has asked for you,  he said with hostility.

She took her work and followed him.

 We have been talking business,  he continued,  but I dare say you knew
all about it beforehand. 

 Yes, I did. 

Clumsy of movement--for he had spent all his life in the saddle--Paul
drove his foot against the paint of the front door. Mrs. Wilcox gave
a little cry of annoyance. She did not like anything scratched; she
stopped in the hall to take Dolly s boa and gloves out of a vase.

Her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining-room, and
by his side, holding his hand rather ostentatiously, was Evie. Dolly,
dressed in purple, sat near the window. The room was a little dark and
airless; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the
hay. Margaret joined the family without speaking; the five of them had
met already at tea, and she knew quite well what was going to be said.
Averse to wasting her time, she went on sewing. The clock struck six.

 Is this going to suit everyone?  said Henry in a weary voice. He used
the old phrases, but their effect was unexpected and shadowy.  Because I
don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been
unfair. 

 It s apparently got to suit us,  said Paul.

 I beg your pardon, my boy. You have only to speak, and I will leave the
house to you instead. 

Paul frowned ill-temperedly, and began scratching at his arm.  As I ve
given up the outdoor life that suited me, and I have come home to look
after the business, it s no good my settling down here,  he said at
last.  It s not really the country, and it s not the town. 

 Very well. Does my arrangement suit you, Evie? 

 Of course, father. 

 And you, Dolly? 

Dolly raised her faded little face, which sorrow could wither but not
steady.  Perfectly splendidly,  she said.  I thought Charles wanted
it for the boys, but last time I saw him he said no, because we cannot
possibly live in this part of England again. Charles says we ought
to change our name, but I cannot think what to, for Wilcox just suits
Charles and me, and I can t think of any other name. 

There was a general silence. Dolly looked nervously round, fearing that
she had been inappropriate. Paul continued to scratch his arm.

 Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely,  said Henry.  And let
everyone understand that; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy
and no surprise. 

Margaret did not answer. There was something uncanny in her triumph.
She, who had never expected to conquer anyone, had charged straight
through these Wilcoxes and broken up their lives.

 In consequence, I leave my wife no money,  said Henry.  That is her own
wish. All that she would have had will be divided among you. I am also
giving you a great deal in my lifetime, so that you may be independent
of me. That is her wish, too. She also is giving away a great deal of
money. She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten
years; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew, down
in the field. Is all that clear? Does everyone understand? 

Paul rose to his feet. He was accustomed to natives, and a very little
shook him out of the Englishman. Feeling manly and cynical, he said:
 Down in the field? Oh, come! I think we might have had the whole
establishment, piccaninnies included. 

Mrs. Cahill whispered:  Don t, Paul. You promised you d take care. 
 Feeling a woman of the world, she rose and prepared to take her leave.

Her father kissed her.  Good-bye, old girl,  he said;  don t you worry
about me. 

 Good-bye, dad. 

Then it was Dolly s turn. Anxious to contribute, she laughed nervously,
and said:  Good-bye, Mr. Wilcox. It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox
should have left Margaret Howards End, and yet she get it, after all. 

From Evie came a sharply-drawn breath.  Goodbye,  she said to Margaret,
and kissed her.

And again and again fell the word, like the ebb of a dying sea.

 Good-bye. 

 Good-bye, Dolly. 

 So long, father. 

 Good-bye, my boy; always take care of yourself. 

 Good-bye, Mrs. Wilcox. 

 Good-bye. 

Margaret saw their visitors to the gate. Then she returned to her
husband and laid her head in his hands. He was pitiably tired. But
Dolly s remark had interested her. At last she said:  Could you tell me,
Henry, what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End? 

Tranquilly he replied:  Yes, she did. But that is a very old story.
When she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some
return, and, not being herself at the time, scribbled  Howards End  on
a piece of paper. I went into it thoroughly, and, as it was clearly
fanciful, I set it aside, little knowing what my Margaret would be to me
in the future. 

Margaret was silent. Something shook her life in its inmost recesses,
and she shivered.

 I didn t do wrong, did I?  he asked, bending down.

 You didn t, darling. Nothing has been done wrong. 

From the garden came laughter.  Here they are at last!  exclaimed Henry,
disengaging himself with a smile. Helen rushed into the gloom, holding
Tom by one hand and carrying her baby on the other. There were shouts of
infectious joy.

 The field s cut!  Helen cried excitedly-- the big meadow! We ve seen to
the very end, and it ll be such a crop of hay as never! 

WEYBRIDGE, 1908-1910.
",tom s father was cutting the big meadow  he passed again and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass  encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the field  tom was
