0,one may as well begin with helen s letters to her sister 
1,howards end 
2,tuesday 
3,dearest meg 
4,it isn t going to be what we expected 
5,it is old and little  and altogether delightful  red brick 
6,we can scarcely pack in as it is  and the dear knows what will happen when paul  younger son  arrives to morrow 
7,from hall you go right or left into dining room or drawing room 
8,hall itself is practically a room 
9,you open another door in it  and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first floor 
10,three bed rooms in a row there  and three attics in a row above 
11,that isn t all the house really  but it s all that one notices  nine windows as you look up from the front garden 
12,then there s a very big wych elm  to the left as you look up  leaning a little over the house  and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow 
13,quite love that tree already 
14,also ordinary elms  oaks  no nastier than ordinary oaks  pear trees  apple trees  and a vine 
15,no silver birches  though 
16,however  must get on to my host and hostess 
17,only wanted to show that it isn t the least what we expected 
18,why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles  and their garden all gamboge coloured paths 
19,believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels  mrs 
20,wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors  mr  wilcox bullying porters  etc 
21,we females are that unjust 
22,shall be back saturday  will let you know train later 
23,they are as angry as am that you did not come too  really tibby is too tiresome  he starts a new mortal disease every month 
24,how could he have got hay fever in london 
25,and even if he could  it seems hard that you should give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze 
26,tell him that charles wilcox  the son who is here  has hay fever too  but he s brave  and gets quite cross when we inquire after it 
27,men like the wilcoxes would do tibby a power of good 
28,but you won t agree  and d better change the subject 
29,this long letter is because m writing before breakfast 
30,oh  the beautiful vine leaves 
31,the house is covered with a vine 
32,looked out earlier  and mrs  wilcox was already in the garden 
33,she evidently loves it 
34,no wonder she sometimes looks tired 
35,she was watching the large red poppies come out 
36,then she walked off the lawn to the meadow  whose corner to the right can just see 
37,trail  trail  went her long dress over the sopping grass  and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterday  suppose for rabbits or something  as she kept on smelling it 
38,the air here is delicious 
39,later on heard the noise of croquet balls  and looked out again  and it was charles wilcox practising  they are keen on all games 
40,presently he started sneezing and had to stop 
41,then hear more clicketing  and it is mr  wilcox practising  and then  a tissue  a tissue   he has to stop too 
42,then evie comes out  and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a green gage tree  they put everything to use  and then she says a tissue  and in she goes 
43,and finally mrs  wilcox reappears  trail  trail  still smelling hay and looking at the flowers 
44,inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama  and one must learn to distinguish tother from which  and up to now have always put that down as meg s clever nonsense 
45,but this morning  it really does seem not life but a play  and it did amuse me enormously to watch the w s 
46,now mrs  wilcox has come in 
47,am going to wear   
48,last night mrs  wilcox wore an    and evie   
49,so it isn t exactly a go as you please place  and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected 
50,not if you open them 
51,the dog roses are too sweet 
52,there is a great hedge of them over the lawn  magnificently tall  so that they fall down in garlands  and nice and thin at the bottom  so that you can see ducks through it and a cow 
53,these belong to the farm  which is the only house near us 
54,there goes the breakfast gong 
55,much love 
56,modified love to tibby 
57,love to aunt juley  how good of her to come and keep you company  but what a bore 
58,burn this 
59,will write again thursday 
60,helen 
61,howards end
62,friday
63,dearest meg 
64,am having a glorious time 
65,like them all 
66,mrs  wilcox  if quieter than in germany  is sweeter than ever  and never saw anything like her steady unselfishness  and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of her 
67,they are the very happiest  jolliest family that you can imagine 
68,do really feel that we are making friends 
69,the fun of it is that they think me a noodle  and say so  at least  mr  wilcox does  and when that happens  and one doesn t mind  it s a pretty sure test  isn t it 
70,he says the most horrid things about woman s suffrage so nicely  and when said believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as ve never had 
71,meg  shall we ever learn to talk less 
72,never felt so ashamed of myself in my life 
73,couldn t point to a time when men had been equal  nor even to a time when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways 
74,couldn t say a word 
75,had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some book  probably from poetry  or you 
76,anyhow  it s been knocked into pieces  and  like all people who are really strong  mr  wilcox did it without hurting me 
77,on the other hand  laugh at them for catching hay fever 
78,we live like fighting cocks  and charles takes us out every day in the motor  a tomb with trees in it  a hermit s house  a wonderful road that was made by the kings of mercia  tennis  a cricket match  bridge and at night we squeeze up in this lovely house 
79,the whole clan s here now  it s like a rabbit warren  evie is a dear  they want me to stop over sunday  suppose it won t matter if do 
80,marvellous weather and the views marvellous  views westward to the high ground 
81,thank you for your letter 
82,burn this 
83,your affectionate
84,helen 
85,howards end 
86,sunday 
87,dearest  dearest meg   do not know what you will say  paul and are in love  the younger son who only came here wednesday 
88,margaret glanced at her sister s note and pushed it over the breakfast table to her aunt 
89,there was a moment s hush  and then the flood gates opened 
90,i can tell you nothing  aunt juley 
91,i know no more than you do 
92,we met  we only met the father and mother abroad last spring  i know so little that i didn t even know their son s name  it s all so   she waved her hand and laughed a little 
93,in that case it is far too sudden 
94,who knows  aunt juley  who knows 
95,but  margaret  dear  i mean  we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts 
96,it is too sudden  surely 
97,who knows 
98,but  margaret  dear  
99,i ll go for her other letters  said margaret 
100,no  i won t  i ll finish my breakfast 
101,in fact  i haven t them 
102,we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer 
103,helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer  the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors  you know   speyer  maintz  and koln 
104,those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street 
105,i still feel quite uneasy about this business  margaret 
106,the train crossed by a bridge of boats  and at first sight it looked quite fine 
107,but oh  in five minutes we had seen the whole thing 
108,the cathedral had been ruined  absolutely ruined  by restoration  not an inch left of the original structure 
109,we wasted a whole day  and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens 
110,they too  poor things  had been taken in  they were actually stopping at speyer  and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg 
111,as a matter of fact  they did come on next day 
112,we all took some drives together 
113,they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them  at least  i was asked too  but tibby s illness prevented me  so last monday she went alone  that s all  you know as much as i do now  it s a young man out of the unknown  she was to have come back saturday  but put off till monday  perhaps on account of  i don t know 
114,she broke off  and listened to the sounds of a london morning 
115,their house was in wickham place  and fairly quiet  for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare 
116,one had the sense of a backwater  or rather of an estuary  whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea  and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating 
117,though the promontory consisted of flats  expensive  with cavernous entrance halls  full of concierges and palms  it fulfilled its purpose  and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace 
118,these  too  would be swept away in time  and another promontory would arise upon their site  as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of london 
119,mrs  munt had her own method of interpreting her nieces 
120,she decided that margaret was a little hysterical  and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk 
121,feeling very diplomatic  she lamented the fate of speyer  and declared that never  never should she be so misguided as to visit it  and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in germany 
122,the germans  she said  are too thorough  and this is all very well sometimes  but at other times it does not do 
123,exactly  said margaret  germans are too thorough 
124,and her eyes began to shine 
125,of course i regard you schlegels as english  said mrs  munt hastily   english to the backbone 
126,margaret leaned forward and stroked her hand 
127,and that reminds me  helen s letter 
128,oh yes  aunt juley  i am thinking all right about helen s letter 
129,i know  i must go down and see her 
130,i am thinking about her all right 
131,i am meaning to go down 
132,but go with some plan  said mrs  munt  admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation 
133,margaret  if i may interfere  don t be taken by surprise 
134,what do you think of the wilcoxes 
135,are they our sort 
136,are they likely people 
137,could they appreciate helen  who is to my mind a very special sort of person 
138,do they care about literature and art 
139,that is most important when you come to think of it 
140,literature and art 
141,most important 
142,how old would the son be 
143,she says younger son 
144,would he be in a position to marry 
145,is he likely to make helen happy 
146,did you gather  
147,i gathered nothing 
148,they began to talk at once 
149,then in that case  
150,in that case i can make no plans  don t you see 
151,on the contrary  
152,i hate plans 
153,i hate lines of action 
154,helen isn t a baby 
155,then in that case  my dear  why go down 
156,margaret was silent 
157,if her aunt could not see why she must go down  she was not going to tell her 
158,she was not going to say  i love my dear sister  i must be near her at this crisis of her life 
159,the affections are more reticent than the passions  and their expression more subtle 
160,if she herself should ever fall in love with a man  she  like helen  would proclaim it from the housetops  but as she loved only a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy 
161,i consider you odd girls  continued mrs  munt  and very wonderful girls  and in many ways far older than your years 
162,but  you won t be offended 
163,frankly  i feel you are not up to this business 
164,it requires an older person 
165,dear  i have nothing to call me back to swanage 
166,she spread out her plump arms 
167,i am all at your disposal 
168,let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you 
169,aunt juley   she jumped up and kissed her   i must  must go to howards end myself 
170,you don t exactly understand  though i can never thank you properly for offering 
171,i do understand  retorted mrs  munt  with immense confidence 
172,i go down in no spirit of interference  but to make inquiries 
173,inquiries are necessary 
174,now  i am going to be rude 
175,you would say the wrong thing  to a certainty you would 
176,in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions  not that one minds offending them 
177,i shall ask no questions 
178,i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love 
179,there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that 
180,all the rest isn t worth a straw 
181,a long engagement if you like  but inquiries  questions  plans  lines of action  no  aunt juley  no 
182,away she hurried  not beautiful  not supremely brilliant  but filled with something that took the place of both qualities  something best described as a profound vivacity  a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her path through life 
183,if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk  
184,dear margaret  do come into the library and shut the door 
185,your good maids are dusting the banisters 
186,  or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson  i should have said the same 
187,then  with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not mad really  and convinced observers of another type that she was not a barren theorist  she added  though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed  i must say 
188,i should think so  said mrs  munt  and  indeed  i can scarcely follow you 
189,now  just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes 
190,i understand it  but most good people would think you mad 
191,imagine how disconcerting for helen 
192,what is wanted is a person who will go slowly  slowly in this business  and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to 
193,margaret was down on this 
194,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off 
195,i think probably it must  but slowly 
196,can you break an engagement off slowly 
197,her eyes lit up 
198,what s an engagement made of  do you suppose 
199,i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap  but can t break 
200,it is different to the other ties of life 
201,they stretch or bend 
202,they admit of degree 
203,they re different 
204,exactly so 
205,but won t you let me just run down to howards house  and save you all the discomfort 
206,i will really not interfere  but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me 
207,margaret again thanked her  again kissed her  and then ran upstairs to see her brother 
208,he was not so well 
209,the hay fever had worried him a good deal all night 
210,his head ached  his eyes were wet  his mucous membrane  he informed her  in a most unsatisfactory condition 
211,the only thing that made life worth living was the thought of walter savage landor  from whose imaginary conversations she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day 
212,it was rather difficult 
213,something must be done about helen 
214,she must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight 
215,a telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic  a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible 
216,now the doctor arrived  and said that tibby was quite bad 
217,might it really be best to accept aunt juley s kind offer  and to send her down to howards end with a note 
218,certainly margaret was impulsive 
219,she did swing rapidly from one decision to another 
220,running downstairs into the library  she cried  yes  i have changed my mind  i do wish that you would go 
221,there was a train from king s cross at eleven 
222,at half past ten tibby  with rare self effacement  fell asleep  and margaret was able to drive her aunt to the station 
223,you will remember  aunt juley  not to be drawn into discussing the engagement 
224,give my letter to helen  and say whatever you feel yourself  but do keep clear of the relatives 
225,we have scarcely got their names straight yet  and  besides  that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong 
226,so uncivilised 
227,queried mrs  munt  fearing that she was losing the point of some brilliant remark 
228,oh  i used an affected word 
229,i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen 
230,only with helen 
231,because   but it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love 
232,even margaret shrank from it  and contented herself with stroking her good aunt s hand  and with meditating  half sensibly and half poetically  on the journey that was about to begin from king s cross 
233,like many others who have lived long in a great capital  she had strong feelings about the various railway termini 
234,they are our gates to the glorious and the unknown 
235,through them we pass out into adventure and sunshine  to them  alas  we return 
236,in paddington all cornwall is latent and the remoter west  down the inclines of liverpool street lie fenlands and the illimitable broads  scotland is through the pylons of euston  wessex behind the poised chaos of waterloo 
237,italians realise this  as is natural  those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in berlin call the anhalt bahnhof the stazione d italia  because by it they must return to their homes 
238,and he is a chilly londoner who does not endow his stations with some personality  and extend to them  however shyly  the emotions of fear and love 
239,to margaret  i hope that it will not set the reader against her  the station of king s cross had always suggested infinity 
240,its very situation  withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of st  pancras  implied a comment on the materialism of life 
241,those two great arches  colourless  indifferent  shouldering between them an unlovely clock  were fit portals for some eternal adventure  whose issue might be prosperous  but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity 
242,if you think this ridiculous  remember that it is not margaret who is telling you about it  and let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for the train  that mrs  munt  though she took a second class ticket  was put by the guard into a first  only two seconds on the train  one smoking and the other babies  one cannot be expected to travel with babies   and that margaret  on her return to wickham place  was confronted with the following telegram 
243,all over 
244,wish i had never written 
245,tell no one    helen 
246,but aunt juley was gone  gone irrevocably  and no power on earth could stop her 
247,most complacently did mrs  munt rehearse her mission 
248,her nieces were independent young women  and it was not often that she was able to help them 
249,emily s daughters had never been quite like other girls 
250,they had been left motherless when tibby was born  when helen was five and margaret herself but thirteen 
251,it was before the passing of the deceased wife s sister bill  so mrs  munt could without impropriety offer to go and keep house at wickham place 
252,but her brother in law  who was peculiar and a german  had referred the question to margaret  who with the crudity of youth had answered  no  they could manage much better alone 
253,five years later mr  schlegel had died too  and mrs  munt had repeated her offer 
254,margaret  crude no longer  had been grateful and extremely nice  but the substance of her answer had been the same 
255,i must not interfere a third time  thought mrs  munt 
256,however  of course she did 
257,she learnt  to her horror  that margaret  now of age  was taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into foreign things  which always smash 
258,silence would have been criminal 
259,her own fortune was invested in home rails  and most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her 
260,then we should be together  dear 
261,margaret  out of politeness  invested a few hundreds in the nottingham and derby railway  and though the foreign things did admirably and the nottingham and derby declined with the steady dignity of which only home rails are capable  mrs  munt never ceased to rejoice  and to say  i did manage that  at all events 
262,when the smash comes poor margaret will have a nest egg to fall back upon 
263,this year helen came of age  and exactly the same thing happened in helen s case  she also would shift her money out of consols  but she  too  almost without being pressed  consecrated a fraction of it to the nottingham and derby railway 
264,so far so good  but in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing 
265,sooner or later the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves away  and if they had delayed hitherto  it was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently in the future 
266,they saw too many people at wickham place  unshaven musicians  an actress even  german cousins  one knows what foreigners are   acquaintances picked up at continental hotels  one knows what they are too  
267,it was interesting  and down at swanage no one appreciated culture more than mrs  munt  but it was dangerous  and disaster was bound to come 
268,how right she was  and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came 
269,the train sped northward  under innumerable tunnels 
270,it was only an hour s journey  but mrs  munt had to raise and lower the window again and again 
271,she passed through the south welwyn tunnel  saw light for a moment  and entered the north welwyn tunnel  of tragic fame 
272,she traversed the immense viaduct  whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of tewin water 
273,she skirted the parks of politicians 
274,at times the great north road accompanied her  more suggestive of infinity than any railway  awakening  after a nap of a hundred years  to such life as is conferred by the stench of motor cars  and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills 
275,to history  to tragedy  to the past  to the future  mrs  munt remained equally indifferent  hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey  and to rescue poor helen from this dreadful mess 
276,the station for howards end was at hilton  one of the large villages that are strung so frequently along the north road  and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and pre coaching days 
277,being near london  it had not shared in the rural decay  and its long high street had budded out right and left into residential estates 
278,for about a mile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before mrs  munt s inattentive eyes  a series broken at one point by six danish tumuli that stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad  tombs of soldiers 
279,beyond these tumuli  habitations thickened  and the train came to a standstill in a tangle that was almost a town 
280,the station  like the scenery  like helen s letters  struck an indeterminate note 
281,into which country will it lead  england or suburbia 
282,it was new  it had island platforms and a subway  and the superficial comfort exacted by business men 
283,but it held hints of local life  personal intercourse  as even mrs  munt was to discover 
284,i want a house  she confided to the ticket boy 
285,its name is howards lodge 
286,do you know where it is 
287,mr  wilcox  the boy called 
288,a young man in front of them turned around 
289,she s wanting howards end 
290,there was nothing for it but to go forward  though mrs  munt was too much agitated even to stare at the stranger 
291,but remembering that there were two brothers  she had the sense to say to him  excuse me asking  but are you the younger mr  wilcox or the elder 
292,the younger 
293,can i do anything for you 
294,oh  well   she controlled herself with difficulty  really  are you  i   she moved  away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice 
295,i am miss schlegel s aunt 
296,i ought to introduce myself  oughtn t i 
297,my name is mrs  munt 
298,she was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly  oh  rather  miss schlegel is stopping with us 
299,did you want to see her 
300,possibly 
301,i ll call you a cab 
302,no  wait a mo   he thought 
303,our motor s here 
304,i ll run you up in it 
305,that is very kind 
306,not at all  if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office 
307,this way 
308,my niece is not with you by any chance 
309,no  i came over with my father 
310,he has gone on north in your train 
311,you ll see miss schlegel at lunch 
312,you re coming up to lunch  i hope 
313,i should like to come up  said mrs  munt  not committing herself to nourishment until she had studied helen s lover a little more 
314,he seemed a gentleman  but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation were numbed 
315,she glanced at him stealthily 
316,to a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the corners of his mouth  or in the rather box like construction of his forehead 
317,he was dark  clean shaven  and seemed accustomed to command 
318,in front or behind 
319,which do you prefer 
320,it may be windy in front 
321,in front if i may  then we can talk 
322,but excuse me one moment  i can t think what they re doing with that parcel 
323,he strode into the booking office  and called with a new voice  hi  hi  you there 
324,are you going to keep me waiting all day 
325,parcel for wilcox  howards end 
326,just look sharp 
327,emerging  he said in quieter tones  this station s abominably organised  if i had my way  the whole lot of them should get the sack 
328,may i help you in 
329,this is very good of you  said mrs  munt  as she settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather  and suffered her person to be padded with rugs and shawls 
330,she was more civil than she had intended  but really this young man was very kind 
331,moreover  she was a little afraid of him  his self possession was extraordinary 
332,very good indeed  she repeated  adding  it is just what i should have wished 
333,very good of you to say so  he replied  with a slight look of surprise  which  like most slight looks  escaped mrs  munt s attention 
334,i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train 
335,you see  we heard from helen this morning 
336,young wilcox was pouring in petrol  starting his engine  and performing other actions with which this story has no concern 
337,the great car began to rock  and the form of mrs  munt  trying to explain things  sprang agreeably up and down among the red cushions 
338,the mater will be very glad to see you  he mumbled 
339,i say 
340,parcel 
341,parcel for howards end 
342,bring it out 
343,a bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book in the other 
344,with the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations mingled  sign  must i 
345,why the    should i sign after all this bother 
346,not even got a pencil on you 
347,remember next time i report you to the station master 
348,my time s of value  though yours mayn t be 
349,here   here being a tip 
350,extremely sorry  mrs  munt 
351,not at all  mr  wilcox 
352,and do you object to going through the village 
353,it is rather a longer spin  but i have one or two commissions 
354,i should love going through the village 
355,naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you 
356,as she said this she felt ashamed  for she was disobeying margaret s instructions 
357,only disobeying them in the letter  surely 
358,margaret had only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders 
359,surely it was not uncivilised or wrong to discuss it with the young man himself  since chance had thrown them together 
360,a reticent fellow  he made no reply 
361,mounting by her side  he put on gloves and spectacles  and off they drove  the bearded porter  life is a mysterious business  looking after them with admiration 
362,the wind was in their faces down the station road  blowing the dust into mrs  munt s eyes 
363,but as soon as they turned into the great north road she opened fire 
364,you can well imagine  she said  that the news was a great shock to us 
365,what news 
366,mr  wilcox  she said frankly  margaret has told me everything  everything 
367,i have seen helen s letter 
368,he could not look her in the face  as his eyes were fixed on his work  he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the high street 
369,but he inclined his head in her direction  and said  i beg your pardon  i didn t catch 
370,about helen 
371,helen  of course 
372,helen is a very exceptional person  i am sure you will let me say this  feeling towards her as you do  indeed  all the schlegels are exceptional 
373,i come in no spirit of interference  but it was a great shock 
374,they drew up opposite a draper s 
375,without replying  he turned round in his seat  and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in their passage through the village 
376,it was settling again  but not all into the road from which he had taken it 
377,some of it had percolated through the open windows  some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the wayside gardens  while a certain proportion had entered the lungs of the villagers 
378,i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads  was his comment 
379,then a man ran out of the draper s with a roll of oilcloth  and off they went again 
380,margaret could not come herself  on account of poor tibby  so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk 
381,i m sorry to be so dense  said the young man  again drawing up outside a shop 
382,but i still haven t quite understood 
383,helen  mr  wilcox  my niece and you 
384,he pushed up his goggles and gazed at her  absolutely bewildered 
385,horror smote her to the heart  for even she began to suspect that they were at cross purposes  and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder 
386,miss schlegel and myself 
387,he asked  compressing his lips 
388,i trust there has been no misunderstanding  quavered mrs  munt 
389,her letter certainly read that way 
390,what way 
391,that you and she   she paused  then drooped her eyelids 
392,i think i catch your meaning  he said stickily 
393,what an extraordinary mistake 
394,then you didn t the least   she stammered  getting blood red in the face  and wishing she had never been born 
395,scarcely  as i am already engaged to another lady 
396,there was a moment s silence  and then he caught his breath and exploded with  oh  good god 
397,don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s 
398,but you are paul 
399,i m not 
400,then why did you say so at the station 
401,i said nothing of the sort 
402,i beg your pardon  you did 
403,i beg your pardon  i did not 
404,my name is charles 
405,younger may mean son as opposed to father  or second brother as opposed to first 
406,there is much to be said for either view  and later on they said it 
407,but they had other questions before them now 
408,do you mean to tell me that paul  
409,but she did not like his voice 
410,he sounded as if he was talking to a porter  and  certain that he had deceived her at the station  she too grew angry 
411,do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece  
412,mrs  munt  such is human nature  determined that she would champion the lovers 
413,she was not going to be bullied by a severe young man 
414,yes  they care for one another very much indeed  she said 
415,i dare say they will tell you about it by and by 
416,we heard this morning 
417,and charles clenched his fist and cried  the idiot  the idiot  the little fool 
418,mrs  munt tried to divest herself of her rugs 
419,if that is your attitude  mr  wilcox  i prefer to walk 
420,i beg you will do no such thing 
421,i take you up this moment to the house 
422,let me tell you the thing s impossible  and must be stopped 
423,mrs  munt did not often lose her temper  and when she did it was only to protect those whom she loved 
424,on this occasion she blazed out 
425,i quite agree  sir 
426,the thing is impossible  and i will come up and stop it 
427,my niece is a very exceptional person  and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her 
428,charles worked his jaws 
429,considering she has only known your brother since wednesday  and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel  
430,could you possibly lower your voice 
431,the shopman will overhear 
432,esprit de classe  if one may coin the phrase  was strong in mrs  munt 
433,she sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal funnel  a saucepan  and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth 
434,right behind 
435,yes  sir 
436,and the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust 
437,i warn you  paul hasn t a penny  it s useless 
438,no need to warn us  mr  wilcox  i assure you 
439,the warning is all the other way 
440,my niece has been very foolish  and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me 
441,he has to make his way out in nigeria 
442,he couldn t think of marrying for years  and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate  and is in other ways  why hasn t he told us  of course he s ashamed  he knows he s been a fool  and so he has  a downright fool 
443,she grew furious 
444,whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news 
445,if i were a man  mr  wilcox  for that last remark i d box your ears 
446,you re not fit to clean my niece s boots  to sit in the same room with her  and you dare  you actually dare  i decline to argue with such a person 
447,all i know is  she s spread the thing and he hasn t  and my father s away and i  
448,and all that i know is  
449,might i finish my sentence  please 
450,charles clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the lane 
451,she screamed 
452,so they played the game of capping families  a round of which is always played when love would unite two members of our race 
453,but they played it with unusual vigour  stating in so many words that schlegels were better than wilcoxes  wilcoxes better than schlegels 
454,they flung decency aside 
455,the man was young  the woman deeply stirred  in both a vein of coarseness was latent 
456,their quarrel was no more surprising than are most quarrels  inevitable at the time  incredible afterwards 
457,but it was more than usually futile 
458,a few minutes  and they were enlightened 
459,the motor drew up at howards end  and helen  looking very pale  ran out to meet her aunt 
460,aunt juley  i have just had a telegram from margaret  i  i meant to stop your coming  it isn t  it s over 
461,the climax was too much for mrs  munt 
462,she burst into tears 
463,aunt juley dear  don t 
464,don t let them know i ve been so silly 
465,it wasn t anything 
466,do bear up for my sake 
467,paul  cried charles wilcox  pulling his gloves off 
468,don t let them know 
469,they are never to know 
470,oh  my darling helen  
471,paul 
472,paul 
473,a very young man came out of the house 
474,paul  is there any truth in this 
475,i didn t  i don t  
476,yes or no  man  plain question  plain answer 
477,did or didn t miss schlegel  
478,charles  dear  said a voice from the garden 
479,charles  dear charles  one doesn t ask plain questions 
480,there aren t such things 
481,they were all silent 
482,it was mrs  wilcox 
483,she approached just as helen s letter had described her  trailing noiselessly over the lawn  and there was actually a wisp of hay in her hands 
484,she seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor  but to the house  and to the tree that overshadowed it 
485,one knew that she worshipped the past  and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone bestow had descended upon her  that wisdom to which we give the clumsy name of aristocracy 
486,high born she might not be 
487,but assuredly she cared about her ancestors  and let them help her 
488,when she saw charles angry  paul frightened  and mrs  munt in tears  she heard her ancestors say  separate those human beings who will hurt each other most 
489,the rest can wait 
490,so she did not ask questions 
491,still less did she pretend that nothing had happened  as a competent society hostess would have done 
492,she said  miss schlegel  would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room  whichever you think best 
493,paul  do find evie  and tell her lunch for six  but i m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it 
494,and when they had obeyed her  she turned to her elder son  who still stood in the throbbing  stinking car  and smiled at him with tenderness  and without saying a word  turned away from him towards her flowers 
495,mother  he called  are you aware that paul has been playing the fool again 
496,it is all right  dear 
497,they have broken off the engagement 
498,engagement   
499,they do not love any longer  if you prefer it put that way  said mrs  wilcox  stooping down to smell a rose 
500,helen and her aunt returned to wickham place in a state of collapse  and for a little time margaret had three invalids on her hands 
501,mrs  munt soon recovered 
502,she possessed to a remarkable degree the power of distorting the past  and before many days were over she had forgotten the part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe 
503,even at the crisis she had cried  thank goodness  poor margaret is saved this  which during the journey to london evolved into  it had to be gone through by some one  which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of the one time really did help emily s girls was over the wilcox business 
504,but helen was a more serious patient 
505,new ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap  and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned 
506,the truth was that she had fallen in love  not with an individual  but with a family 
507,before paul arrived she had  as it were  been tuned up into his key 
508,the energy of the wilcoxes had fascinated her  had created new images of beauty in her responsive mind 
509,to be all day with them in the open air  to sleep at night under their roof  had seemed the supreme joy of life  and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude to love 
510,she had liked giving in to mr  wilcox  or evie  or charles  she had liked being told that her notions of life were sheltered or academic  that equality was nonsense  votes for women nonsense  socialism nonsense  art and literature  except when conducive to strengthening the character  nonsense 
511,one by one the schlegel fetiches had been overthrown  and  though professing to defend them  she had rejoiced 
512,when mr  wilcox said that one sound man of business did more good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers  she had swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp  and had leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar 
513,when charles said  why be so polite to servants 
514,they don t understand it  she had not given the schlegel retort of  if they don t understand it  do 
515,no  she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future 
516,am swathed in cannot  she thought  and it is good for me to be stripped of it 
517,and all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for paul 
518,paul was inevitable 
519,charles was taken up with another girl  mr  wilcox was so old  evie so young  mrs  wilcox so different 
520,round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of romance  to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days  to feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal 
521,he and she were about the same age  evie said 
522,most people thought paul handsomer than his brother 
523,he was certainly a better shot  though not so good at golf 
524,and when paul appeared  flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination  and ready to flirt with any pretty girl  helen met him halfway  or more than halfway  and turned towards him on the sunday evening 
525,he had been talking of his approaching exile in nigeria  and he should have continued to talk of it  and allowed their guest to recover 
526,but the heave of her bosom flattered him 
527,passion was possible  and he became passionate 
528,deep down in him something whispered  this girl would let you kiss her  you might not have such a chance again 
529,that was how it happened  or  rather  how helen described it to her sister  using words even more unsympathetic than my own 
530,but the poetry of that kiss  the wonder of it  the magic that there was in life for hours after it  who can describe that 
531,it is so easy for an englishman to sneer at these chance collisions of human beings 
532,to the insular cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity 
533,it is so easy to talk of passing emotion  and to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it passed 
534,our impulse to sneer  to forget  is at root a good one 
535,we recognise that emotion is not enough  and that men and women are personalities capable of sustained relations  not mere opportunities for an electrical discharge 
536,yet we rate the impulse too highly 
537,we do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open 
538,to helen  at all events  her life was to bring nothing more intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it 
539,he had drawn her out of the house  where there was danger of surprise and light  he had led her by a path he knew  until they stood under the column of the vast wych elm 
540,a man in the darkness  he had whispered love you when she was desiring love 
541,in time his slender personality faded  the scene that he had evoked endured 
542,in all the variable years that followed she never saw the like of it again 
543,understand  said margaret   at least  understand as much as ever is understood of these things 
544,tell me now what happened on the monday morning 
545,it was over at once 
546,how  helen 
547,was still happy while dressed  but as came downstairs got nervous  and when went into the dining room knew it was no good 
548,there was evie  can t explain  managing the tea urn  and mr  wilcox reading the times 
549,was paul there 
550,yes  and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares  and he looked frightened 
551,by slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other 
552,margaret saw horror latent in the scene  and helen s next remark did not surprise her 
553,somehow  when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful 
554,it is all right for us to be frightened  or for men of another sort  father  for instance  but for men like that 
555,when saw all the others so placid  and paul mad with terror in case said the wrong thing  felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud  just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs  and that if it fell should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness 
556,don t think that 
557,the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people  particularly the wife 
558,no  don t really think that 
559,but paul was so broad shouldered  all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse  and knew that it would never do  never  said to him after breakfast  when the others were practising strokes  we rather lost our heads  and he looked better at once  though frightfully ashamed  he began a speech about having no money to marry on  but it hurt him to make it  and stopped him  then he said  must beg your pardon over this  miss schlegel  can t think what came over me last night  and said  nor what over me  never mind  and then we parted  at least  until remembered that had written straight off to tell you the night before  and that frightened him again 
560,asked him to send a telegram for me  for he knew you would be coming or something  and he tried to get hold of the motor  but charles and mr  wilcox wanted it to go to the station  and charles offered to send the telegram for me  and then had to say that the telegram was of no consequence  for paul said charles might read it  and though wrote it out several times  he always said people would suspect something 
561,he took it himself at last  pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges  and  what with one thing and the other  it was not handed in at the post office until too late 
562,it was the most terrible morning 
563,paul disliked me more and more  and evie talked cricket averages till nearly screamed 
564,cannot think how stood her all the other days 
565,at last charles and his father started for the station  and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train  and paul  oh  rather horrible  said that had muddled it 
566,but mrs  wilcox knew 
567,knew what 
568,everything  though we neither of us told her a word  and she had known all along  think 
569,oh  she must have overheard you 
570,suppose so  but it seemed wonderful 
571,when charles and aunt juley drove up  calling each other names  mrs  wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible 
572,ugh  but it has been a disgusting business 
573,to think that   she sighed 
574,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment  there must be all these telegrams and anger  supplied margaret 
575,helen nodded 
576,ve often thought about it  helen 
577,it s one of the most interesting things in the world 
578,the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and have never touched  a life in which telegrams and anger count  personal relations  that we think supreme  are not supreme there  there love means marriage settlements  death  death duties  so far m clear  but here my difficulty  this outer life  though obviously horrid  often seems the real one  there s grit in it 
579,it does breed character 
580,do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end 
581,oh  meg    that s what felt  only not so clearly  when the wilcoxes were so competent  and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes 
582,don t you feel it now 
583,remember paul at breakfast  said helen quietly 
584,shall never forget him 
585,he had nothing to fall back upon 
586,know that personal relations are the real life  for ever and ever 
587,amen 
588,so the wilcox episode fell into the background  leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled  and the sisters pursued the life that helen had commended 
589,they talked to each other and to other people  they filled the tall thin house at wickham place with those whom they liked or could befriend 
590,they even attended public meetings 
591,in their own fashion they cared deeply about politics  though not as politicians would have us care  they desired that public life should mirror whatever is good in the life within 
592,temperance  tolerance  and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them  whereas they did not follow our forward policy in tibet with the keen attention that it merits  and would at times dismiss the whole british empire with a puzzled  if reverent  sigh 
593,not out of them are the shows of history erected  the world would be a grey  bloodless place were it composed entirely of miss schlegels 
594,but the world being what it is  perhaps they shine out in it like stars 
595,a word on their origin 
596,they were not english to the back bone  as their aunt had piously asserted 
597,but  on the other hand  they were not germans of the dreadful sort 
598,their father had belonged to a type that was more prominent in germany fifty years ago than now 
599,he was not the aggressive german  so dear to the english journalist  nor the domestic german  so dear to the english wit 
600,if one classed him at all it would be as the countryman of hegel and kant  as the idealist  inclined to be dreamy  whose imperialism was the imperialism of the air 
601,not that his life had been inactive 
602,he had fought like blazes against denmark  austria  france 
603,but he had fought without visualising the results of victory 
604,a hint of the truth broke on him after sedan  when he saw the dyed moustaches of napoleon going grey  another when he entered paris  and saw the smashed windows of the tuileries 
605,peace came  it was all very immense  one had turned into an empire  but he knew that some quality had vanished for which not all alsace lorraine could compensate him 
606,germany a commercial power  germany a naval power  germany with colonies here and a forward policy there  and legitimate aspirations in the other place  might appeal to others  and be fitly served by them  for his own part  he abstained from the fruits of victory  and naturalised himself in england 
607,the more earnest members of his family never forgave him  and knew that his children  though scarcely english of the dreadful sort  would never be german to the back bone 
608,he had obtained work in one of our provincial universities  and there married poor emily  or die englanderin  as the case may be   and as she had money  they proceeded to london  and came to know a good many people 
609,but his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea 
610,it was his hope that the clouds of materialism obscuring the fatherland would part in time  and the mild intellectual light re emerge 
611,do you imply that we germans are stupid  uncle ernst 
612,exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew 
613,uncle ernst replied  to my mind 
614,you use the intellect  but you no longer care about it 
615,that call stupidity 
616,as the haughty nephew did not follow  he continued  you only care about the things that you can use  and therefore arrange them in the following order  money  supremely useful  intellect  rather useful  imagination  of no use at all 
617,no   for the other had protested   your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here 
618,it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness  to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile  and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven 
619,that is not imagination 
620,no  it kills it 
621,when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once  and naturally 
622,your poets too are dying  your philosophers  your musicians  to whom europe has listened for two hundred years 
623,gone 
624,gone with the little courts that nurtured them  gone with esterhazy and weimar 
625,what 
626,what s that 
627,your universities 
628,oh yes  you have learned men  who collect more facts than do the learned men of england 
629,they collect facts  and facts  and empires of facts 
630,but which of them will rekindle the light within 
631,to all this margaret listened  sitting on the haughty nephew s knee 
632,it was a unique education for the little girls 
633,the haughty nephew would be at wickham place one day  bringing with him an even haughtier wife  both convinced that germany was appointed by god to govern the world 
634,aunt juley would come the next day  convinced that great britain had been appointed to the same post by the same authority 
635,were both these loud voiced parties right 
636,on one occasion they had met and margaret with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence 
637,whereat they blushed  and began to talk about the weather 
638,papa  she cried  she was a most offensive child   why will they not discuss this most clear question 
639,her father  surveying the parties grimly  replied that he did not know 
640,putting her head on one side  margaret then remarked  to me one of two things is very clear  either god does not know his own mind about england and germany  or else these do not know the mind of god 
641,a hateful little girl  but at thirteen she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without perceiving 
642,her brain darted up and down  it grew pliant and strong 
643,her conclusion was  that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organisation  and from this she never varied 
644,helen advanced along the same lines  though with a more irresponsible tread 
645,in character she resembled her sister  but she was pretty  and so apt to have a more amusing time 
646,people gathered round her more readily  especially when they were new acquaintances  and she did enjoy a little homage very much 
647,when their father died and they ruled alone at wickham place  she often absorbed the whole of the company  while margaret  both were tremendous talkers  fell flat 
648,neither sister bothered about this 
649,helen never apologised afterwards  margaret did not feel the slightest rancour 
650,but looks have their influence upon character 
651,the sisters were alike as little girls  but at the time of the wilcox episode their methods were beginning to diverge  the younger was rather apt to entice people  and  in enticing them  to be herself enticed  the elder went straight ahead  and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game 
652,little need be premised about tibby 
653,he was now an intelligent man of sixteen  but dyspeptic and difficile 
654,it will be generally admitted that beethoven s fifth symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man 
655,all sorts and conditions are satisfied by it 
656,whether you are like mrs  munt  and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come  of course  not so as to disturb the others  or like helen  who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music s flood  or like margaret  who can only see the music  or like tibby  who is profoundly versed in counterpoint  and holds the full score open on his knee  or like their cousin  fraulein mosebach  who remembers all the time that beethoven is echt deutsch  or like fraulein mosebach s young man  who can remember nothing but fraulein mosebach  in any case  the passion of your life becomes more vivid  and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings 
657,it is cheap  even if you hear it in the queen s hall  dreariest music room in london  though not as dreary as the free trade hall  manchester  and even if you sit on the extreme left of that hall  so that the brass bumps at you before the rest of the orchestra arrives  it is still cheap 
658,whom is margaret talking to 
659,said mrs  munt  at the conclusion of the first movement 
660,she was again in london on a visit to wickham place 
661,helen looked down the long line of their party  and said that she did not know 
662,would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in 
663,expect so  helen replied 
664,music enwrapped her  and she could not enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows 
665,you girls are so wonderful in always having  oh dear  one mustn t talk 
666,for the andante had begun  very beautiful  but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful andantes that beethoven had written  and  to helen s mind  rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third 
667,she heard the tune through once  and then her attention wandered  and she gazed at the audience  or the organ  or the architecture 
668,much did she censure the attenuated cupids who encircle the ceiling of the queen s hall  inclining each to each with vapid gesture  and clad in sallow pantaloons  on which the october sunlight struck 
669,how awful to marry a man like those cupids  thought helen 
670,here beethoven started decorating his tune  so she heard him through once more  and then she smiled at her cousin frieda 
671,but frieda  listening to classical music  could not respond 
672,herr liesecke  too  looked as if wild horses could not make him inattentive  there were lines across his forehead  his lips were parted  his pince nez at right angles to his nose  and he had laid a thick  white hand on either knee 
673,and next to her was aunt juley  so british  and wanting to tap 
674,how interesting that row of people was 
675,what diverse influences had gone to the making 
676,here beethoven  after humming and hawing with great sweetness  said heigho  and the andante came to an end 
677,applause  and a round of wunderschoning and pracht volleying from the german contingent 
678,margaret started talking to her new young man  helen said to her aunt  now comes the wonderful movement  first of all the goblins  and then a trio of elephants dancing   and tibby implored the company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the drum 
679,on the what  dear 
680,on the drum  aunt juley 
681,no  look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back  breathed helen  as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe  from end to end 
682,others followed him 
683,they were not aggressive creatures  it was that that made them so terrible to helen 
684,they merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world 
685,after the interlude of elephants dancing  they returned and made the observation for the second time 
686,helen could not contradict them  for  once at all events  she had felt the same  and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse 
687,panic and emptiness 
688,panic and emptiness 
689,the goblins were right 
690,her brother raised his finger  it was the transitional passage on the drum 
691,for  as if things were going too far  beethoven took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted 
692,he appeared in person 
693,he gave them a little push  and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a minor  and then  he blew with his mouth and they were scattered 
694,gusts of splendour  gods and demigods contending with vast swords  colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle  magnificent victory  magnificent death 
695,oh  it all burst before the girl  and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible 
696,any fate was titanic  any contest desirable  conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars 
697,and the goblins  they had not really been there at all 
698,they were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief 
699,one healthy human impulse would dispel them 
700,men like the wilcoxes  or ex president roosevelt  would say yes 
701,beethoven knew better 
702,the goblins really had been there 
703,they might return  and they did 
704,it was as if the splendour of life might boil over and waste to steam and froth 
705,in its dissolution one heard the terrible  ominous note  and a goblin  with increased malignity  walked quietly over the universe from end to end 
706,panic and emptiness 
707,panic and emptiness 
708,even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall 
709,beethoven chose to make all right in the end 
710,he built the ramparts up 
711,he blew with his mouth for the second time  and again the goblins were scattered 
712,he brought back the gusts of splendour  the heroism  the youth  the magnificence of life and of death  and  amid vast roarings of a superhuman joy  he led his fifth symphony to its conclusion 
713,but the goblins were there 
714,they could return 
715,he had said so bravely  and that is why one can trust beethoven when he says other things 
716,helen pushed her way out during the applause 
717,she desired to be alone 
718,the music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career 
719,she read it as a tangible statement  which could never be superseded 
720,the notes meant this and that to her  and they could have no other meaning  and life could have no other meaning 
721,she pushed right out of the building and walked slowly down the outside staircase  breathing the autumnal air  and then she strolled home 
722,margaret  called mrs  munt  is helen all right 
723,oh yes 
724,she is always going away in the middle of a programme  said tibby 
725,the music has evidently moved her deeply  said fraulein mosebach 
726,excuse me  said margaret s young man  who had for some time been preparing a sentence  but that lady has  quite inadvertently  taken my umbrella 
727,oh  good gracious me   am so sorry 
728,tibby  run after helen 
729,shall miss the four serious songs if do 
730,tibby  love  you must go 
731,it isn t of any consequence  said the young man  in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella 
732,but of course it is 
733,tibby 
734,tibby 
735,tibby rose to his feet  and wilfully caught his person on the backs of the chairs 
736,by the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat  and had deposited his full score in safety  it was too late to go after helen 
737,the four serious songs had begun  and one could not move during their performance 
738,my sister is so careless  whispered margaret 
739,not at all  replied the young man  but his voice was dead and cold 
740,if you would give me your address  
741,oh  not at all  not at all  and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees 
742,then the four serious songs rang shallow in margaret s ears 
743,brahms  for all his grumbling and grizzling  had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an umbrella 
744,for this fool of a young man thought that she and helen and tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him  and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walking stick too 
745,most ladies would have laughed  but margaret really minded  for it gave her a glimpse into squalor 
746,to trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge  the poor cannot afford it 
747,as soon as brahms had grunted himself out  she gave him her card and said  that is where we live  if you preferred  you could call for the umbrella after the concert  but didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault 
748,his face brightened a little when he saw that wickham place was w  it was sad to see him corroded with suspicion  and yet not daring to be impolite  in case these well dressed people were honest after all 
749,she took it as a good sign that he said to her  it s a fine programme this afternoon  is it not 
750,for this was the remark with which he had originally opened  before the umbrella intervened 
751,the beethoven s fine  said margaret  who was not a female of the encouraging type 
752,don t like the brahms  though  nor the mendelssohn that came first and ugh  don t like this elgar that s coming 
753,what  what 
754,called herr liesecke  overhearing 
755,the pomp and circumstance will not be fine 
756,oh  margaret  you tiresome girl  cried her aunt 
757,here have been persuading herr liesecke to stop for pomp and circumstance  and you are undoing all my work 
758,am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in music 
759,oh   you musn t run down our english composers  margaret 
760,for my part  have heard the composition at stettin  said fraulein mosebach  on two occasions 
761,it is dramatic  a little 
762,frieda  you despise english music 
763,you know you do 
764,and english art 
765,and english literature  except shakespeare  and he s a german 
766,very well  frieda  you may go 
767,the lovers laughed and glanced at each other 
768,moved by a common impulse  they rose to their feet and fled from pomp and circumstance 
769,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus  it is true  said herr liesecke  as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music started 
770,margaret   loudly whispered by aunt juley 
771,margaret  margaret 
772,fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat 
773,sure enough  there was frieda s reticule  containing her address book  her pocket dictionary  her map of london  and her money 
774,oh  what a bother  what a family we are  fr  frieda 
775,hush  said all those who thought the music fine 
776,but it s the number they want in finsbury circus 
777,might i  couldn t i   said the suspicious young man  and got very red 
778,oh  would be so grateful 
779,he took the bag  money clinking inside it  and slipped up the gangway with it 
780,he was just in time to catch them at the swing door  and he received a pretty smile from the german girl and a fine bow from her cavalier 
781,he returned to his seat upsides with the world 
782,the trust that they had reposed in him was trivial  but he felt that it cancelled his mistrust for them  and that probably he would not be had over his umbrella 
783,this young man had been had in the past badly  perhaps overwhelmingly  and now most of his energies went in defending himself against the unknown  but this afternoon  perhaps on account of music  he perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good of being alive 
784,wickham place  w   though a risk  was as safe as most things  and he would risk it 
785,so when the concert was over and margaret said  we live quite near  am going there now 
786,could you walk round with me  and we ll find your umbrella 
787,he said  thank you  peaceably  and followed her out of the queen s hall 
788,she wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs  or to carry a lady s programme for her  his class was near enough her own for its manners to vex her  but she found him interesting on the whole  every one interested the schlegels on the whole at that time  and while her lips talked culture  her heart was planning to invite him to tea 
789,how tired one gets after music  she began 
790,do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive 
791,yes  horribly 
792,but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive 
793,do you go there much 
794,when my work permits  attend the gallery for the royal opera 
795,helen would have exclaimed  so do i  love the gallery  and thus have endeared herself to the young man 
796,helen could do these things 
797,but margaret had an almost morbid horror of drawing people out  of making things go 
798,she had been to the gallery at covent garden  but she did not attend it  preferring the more expensive seats  still less did she love it 
799,so she made no reply 
800,this year have been three times  to faust  tosca  and   was it tannhouser or tannhoyser  
801,better not risk the word 
802,margaret disliked tosca and faust 
803,and so  for one reason and another  they walked on in silence  chaperoned by the voice of mrs  munt  who was getting into difficulties with her nephew 
804,do in a way remember the passage  tibby  but when every instrument is so beautiful  it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another 
805,am sure that you and helen take me to the very nicest concerts 
806,not a dull note from beginning to end 
807,only wish that our german friends had stayed till it finished 
808,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c  aunt juley 
809,came tibby s voice 
810,no one could 
811,it s unmistakable 
812,a specially loud part 
813,hazarded mrs  munt 
814,of course do not go in for being musical  she added  the shot failing 
815,only care for music  a very different thing  but still will say this for myself  do know when like a thing and when don t 
816,some people are the same about pictures 
817,they can go into a picture gallery  miss conder can  and say straight off what they feel  all round the wall 
818,never could do that 
819,but music is so different from pictures  to my mind 
820,when it comes to music am as safe as houses  and assure you  tibby  am by no means pleased by everything 
821,there was a thing  something about a faun in french  which helen went into ecstasies over  but thought it most tinkling and superficial  and said so  and held to my opinion too 
822,do you agree 
823,asked margaret 
824,do you think music is so different from pictures 
825,i  should have thought so  kind of  he said 
826,so should i  now  my sister declares they re just the same 
827,we have great arguments over it 
828,she says m dense  say she s sloppy 
829,getting under way  she cried  now  doesn t it seem absurd to you 
830,what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable 
831,what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye 
832,helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting  and pictures into the language of music 
833,it s very ingenious  and she says several pretty things in the process  but what s gained  d like to know 
834,oh  it s all rubbish  radically false 
835,if monet s really debussy  and debussy s really monet  neither gentleman is worth his salt  that s my opinion 
836,evidently these sisters quarrelled 
837,now  this very symphony that we ve just been having  she won t let it alone  she labels it with meanings from start to finish  turns it into literature  wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music  yet don t know  there s my brother  behind us 
838,he treats music as music  and oh  my goodness 
839,he makes me angrier than any one  simply furious 
840,with him daren t even argue 
841,an unhappy family  if talented 
842,but  of course  the real villain is wagner 
843,he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts 
844,do feel that music is in a very serious state just now  though extraordinarily interesting 
845,every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses  like wagner  who stir up all the wells of thought at once 
846,for a moment it s splendid 
847,such a splash as never was 
848,but afterwards  such a lot of mud  and the wells  as it were  they communicate with each other too easily now  and not one of them will run quite clear 
849,that s what wagner s done 
850,her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds 
851,if only he could talk like this  he would have caught the world 
852,oh  to acquire culture 
853,oh  to pronounce foreign names correctly 
854,oh  to be well informed  discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started 
855,but it would take one years 
856,with an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours in the evening  how was it possible to catch up with leisured women  who had been reading steadily from childhood 
857,his brain might be full of names  he might have even heard of monet and debussy  the trouble was that he could not string them together into a sentence  he could not make them tell  he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella 
858,yes  the umbrella was the real trouble 
859,behind monet and debussy the umbrella persisted  with the steady beat of a drum 
860,suppose my umbrella will be all right  he was thinking 
861,don t really mind about it 
862,will think about music instead 
863,suppose my umbrella will be all right 
864,earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats 
865,ought he to have paid as much as two shillings 
866,earlier still he had wondered  shall try to do without a programme 
867,there had always been something to worry him ever since he could remember  always something that distracted him in the pursuit of beauty 
868,for he did pursue beauty  and  therefore  margaret s speeches did flutter away from him like birds 
869,margaret talked ahead  occasionally saying  don t you think so 
870,don t you feel the same 
871,and once she stopped  and said  oh  do interrupt me  which terrified him 
872,she did not attract him  though she filled him with awe 
873,her figure was meagre  her face seemed all teeth and eyes  her references to her sister and her brother were uncharitable 
874,for all her cleverness and culture  she was probably one of those soulless  atheistical women who have been so shown up by miss corelli 
875,it was surprising  and alarming  that she should suddenly say  do hope that you ll come in and have some tea 
876,we should be so glad 
877,have dragged you so far out of your way 
878,they had arrived at wickham place 
879,the sun had set  and the backwater  in deep shadow  was filling with a gentle haze 
880,to the right the fantastic sky line of the flats towered black against the hues of evening  to the left the older houses raised a square cut  irregular parapet against the grey 
881,margaret fumbled for her latch key 
882,of course she had forgotten it 
883,so  grasping her umbrella by its ferrule  she leant over the area and tapped at the dining room window 
884,helen 
885,let us in 
886,all right  said a voice 
887,you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella 
888,taken a what 
889,said helen  opening the door 
890,oh  what s that 
891,do come in 
892,how do you do 
893,helen  you must not be so ramshackly 
894,you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall  and he has had the trouble of coming round for it 
895,oh  am so sorry  cried helen  all her hair flying 
896,she had pulled off her hat as soon as she returned  and had flung herself into the big dining room chair 
897,do nothing but steal umbrellas 
898,am so very sorry 
899,do come in and choose one 
900,is yours a hooky or a nobbly 
901,mine s a nobbly  at least  think it is 
902,the light was turned on  and they began to search the hall  helen  who had abruptly parted with the fifth symphony  commenting with shrill little cries 
903,don t you talk  meg 
904,you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat 
905,yes  she did  aunt juley 
906,it is a positive fact 
907,she thought it was a muff 
908,oh  heavens  ve knocked the in and out card down 
909,where s frieda 
910,tibby  why don t you ever  no  can t remember what was going to say 
911,that wasn t it  but do tell the maids to hurry tea up 
912,what about this umbrella 
913,she opened it 
914,no  it s all gone along the seams 
915,it s an appalling umbrella 
916,it must be mine 
917,but it was not 
918,he took it from her  murmured a few words of thanks  and then fled  with the lilting step of the clerk 
919,but if you will stop   cried margaret 
920,now  helen  how stupid you ve been 
921,whatever have done 
922,don t you see that you ve frightened him away 
923,meant him to stop to tea 
924,you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella 
925,saw his nice eyes getting so miserable 
926,no  it s not a bit of good now 
927,for helen had darted out into the street  shouting  oh  do stop 
928,dare say it is all for the best  opined mrs  munt 
929,we know nothing about the young man  margaret  and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things 
930,but helen cried  aunt juley  how can you 
931,you make me more and more ashamed 
932,d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i  well  must shut the front door  suppose 
933,one more failure for helen 
934,yes  think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent  said margaret 
935,seeing that her aunt did not understand  she added  you remember rent  
936,it was one of father s words  rent to the ideal  to his own faith in human nature  you remember how he would trust strangers  and if they fooled him he would say  it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious   that the confidence trick is the work of man  but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil 
937,remember something of the sort now  said mrs  munt  rather tartly  for she longed to add  it was lucky that your father married a wife with money 
938,but this was unkind  and she contented herself with  why  he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well 
939,better that he had  said helen stoutly 
940,no  agree with aunt juley  said margaret 
941,d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts 
942,there are limits 
943,their brother  finding the incident commonplace  had stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea 
944,he warmed the teapot  almost too deftly  rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour maid had provided  poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend  filled up with really boiling water  and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would lose the aroma 
945,all right  auntie tibby  called helen  while margaret  thoughtful again  said  in a way  wish we had a real boy in the house  the kind of boy who cares for men 
946,it would make entertaining so much easier 
947,so do i  said her sister 
948,tibby only cares for cultured females singing brahms 
949,and when they joined him she said rather sharply  why didn t you make that young man welcome  tibby 
950,you must do the host a little  you know 
951,you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping  instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women 
952,tibby sighed  and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead 
953,oh  it s no good looking superior 
954,mean what say 
955,leave tibby alone  said margaret  who could not bear her brother to be scolded 
956,here s the house a regular hen coop  grumbled helen 
957,oh  my dear  protested mrs  munt 
958,how can you say such dreadful things 
959,the number of men you get here has always astonished me 
960,if there is any danger it s the other way round 
961,yes  but it s the wrong sort of men  helen means 
962,no  don t  corrected helen 
963,we get the right sort of man  but the wrong side of him  and say that s tibby s fault 
964,there ought to be a something about the house  an  don t know what 
965,a touch of the w s  perhaps 
966,helen put out her tongue 
967,who are the w s 
968,asked tibby 
969,the w s are things and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t  so there 
970,suppose that ours is a female house  said margaret  and one must just accept it 
971,no  aunt juley  don t mean that this house is full of women 
972,am trying to say something much more clever 
973,mean that it was irrevocably feminine  even in father s time 
974,now m sure you understand 
975,well  ll give you another example 
976,it ll shock you  but don t care 
977,suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party  and that the guests had been leighton  millais  swinburne  rossetti  meredith  fitzgerald  etc 
978,do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic 
979,heavens  no 
980,the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that 
981,so with our house  it must be feminine  and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate 
982,just as another house that can mention  but won t  sounded irrevocably masculine  and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal 
983,that house being the w s house  presume  said tibby 
984,you re not going to be told about the w s  my child  helen cried  so don t you think it 
985,and on the other hand  don t the least mind if you find out  so don t you think you ve done anything clever  in either case 
986,give me a cigarette 
987,you do what you can for the house  said margaret 
988,the drawing room reeks of smoke 
989,if you smoked too  the house might suddenly turn masculine 
990,atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go 
991,even at queen victoria s dinner party  if something had been just a little different  perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin 
992,with an india shawl over her shoulders  
993,fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin 
994,bursts of disloyal laughter  you must remember that they are half german  greeted these suggestions  and margaret said pensively  how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art 
995,and the conversation drifted away and away  and helen s cigarette turned to a spot in the darkness  and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted windows which vanished and were relit again  and vanished incessantly 
996,beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently  a tide that could never be quiet  while in the east  invisible behind the smokes of wapping  the moon was rising 
997,that reminds me  margaret 
998,we might have taken that young man into the dining room  at all events 
999,only the majolica plate  and that is so firmly set in the wall 
1000,am really distressed that he had no tea 
1001,for that little incident had impressed the three women more than might be supposed 
1002,it remained as a goblin footfall  as a hint that all is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds  and that beneath these superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill fed boy  who has recovered his umbrella indeed  but who has left no address behind him  and no name 
1003,we are not concerned with the very poor 
1004,they are unthinkable and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet 
1005,this story deals with gentlefolk  or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk 
1006,the boy  leonard bast  stood at the extreme verge of gentility 
1007,he was not in the abyss  but he could see it  and at times people whom he knew had dropped in  and counted no more 
1008,he knew that he was poor  and would admit it  he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich 
1009,this may be splendid of him 
1010,but he was inferior to most rich people  there is not the least doubt of it 
1011,he was not as courteous as the average rich man  nor as intelligent  nor as healthy  nor as lovable 
1012,his mind and his body had been alike underfed  because he was poor  and because he was modern they were always craving better food 
1013,had he lived some centuries ago  in the brightly coloured civilisations of the past  he would have had a definite status  his rank and his income would have corresponded 
1014,but in his day the angel of democracy had arisen  enshadowing the classes with leathern wings  and proclaiming  all men are equal  all men  that is to say  who possess umbrellas  and so he was obliged to assert gentility  lest he slip into the abyss where nothing counts  and the statements of democracy are inaudible 
1015,as he walked away from wickham place  his first care was to prove that he was as good as the miss schlegels 
1016,obscurely wounded in his pride  he tried to wound them in return 
1017,they were probably not ladies 
1018,would real ladies have asked him to tea 
1019,they were certainly ill natured and cold 
1020,at each step his feeling of superiority increased 
1021,would a real lady have talked about stealing an umbrella 
1022,perhaps they were thieves after all  and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a chloroformed handkerchief over his face 
1023,he walked on complacently as far as the houses of parliament 
1024,there an empty stomach asserted itself  and told him that he was a fool 
1025,evening  mr  bast 
1026,evening  mr  dealtry 
1027,nice evening 
1028,evening 
1029,mr  dealtry  a fellow clerk  passed on  and leonard stood wondering whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him  or whether he would walk 
1030,he decided to walk  it is no good giving in  and he had spent money enough at queen s hall  and he walked over westminster bridge  in front of st  thomas s hospital  and through the immense tunnel that passes under the south western main line at vauxhall 
1031,in the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the trains 
1032,a sharp pain darted through his head  and he was conscious of the exact form of his eye sockets 
1033,he pushed on for another mile  and did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called camelia road which was at present his home 
1034,here he stopped again  and glanced suspiciously to right and left  like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole 
1035,a block of flats  constructed with extreme cheapness  towered on either hand 
1036,farther down the road two more blocks were being built  and beyond these an old house was being demolished to accommodate another pair 
1037,it was the kind of scene that may be observed all over london  whatever the locality  bricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of the water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her soil 
1038,camelia road would soon stand out like a fortress  and command  for a little  an extensive view 
1039,only for a little 
1040,plans were out for the erection of flats in magnolia road also 
1041,and again a few years  and all the flats in either road might be pulled down  and new buildings  of a vastness at present unimaginable  might arise where they had fallen 
1042,evening  mr  bast 
1043,evening  mr  cunningham 
1044,very serious thing this decline of the birth rate in manchester 
1045,i beg your pardon 
1046,very serious thing this decline of the birth rate in manchester  repeated mr  cunningham  tapping the sunday paper  in which the calamity in question had just been announced to him 
1047,ah  yes  said leonard  who was not going to let on that he had not bought a sunday paper 
1048,if this kind of thing goes on the population of england will be stationary in  
1049,you don t say so 
1050,i call it a very serious thing  eh 
1051,good evening  mr  cunningham 
1052,good evening  mr  bast 
1053,then leonard entered block b of the flats  and turned  not upstairs  but down  into what is known to house agents as a semi basement  and to other men as a cellar 
1054,he opened the door  and cried  hullo  with the pseudo geniality of the cockney 
1055,there was no reply 
1056,hullo  he repeated 
1057,the sitting room was empty  though the electric light had been left burning 
1058,a look of relief came over his face  and he flung himself into the armchair 
1059,the sitting room contained  besides the armchair  two other chairs  a piano  a three legged table  and a cosy corner 
1060,of the walls  one was occupied by the window  the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with cupids 
1061,opposite the window was the door  and beside the door a bookcase  while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of maud goodman 
1062,it was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the curtains were drawn  and the lights turned on  and the gas stove unlit 
1063,but it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the dwelling place 
1064,it had been too easily gained  and could be relinquished too easily 
1065,as leonard was kicking off his boots he jarred the three legged table  and a photograph frame  honourably poised upon it  slid sideways  fell off into the fireplace  and smashed 
1066,he swore in a colourless sort of way  and picked the photograph up 
1067,it represented a young lady called jacky  and had been taken at the time when young ladies called jacky were often photographed with their mouths open 
1068,teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along either of jacky s jaws  and positively weighed her head sideways  so large were they and so numerous 
1069,take my word for it  that smile was simply stunning  and it is only you and i who will be fastidious  and complain that true joy begins in the eyes  and that the eyes of jacky did not accord with her smile  but were anxious and hungry 
1070,leonard tried to pull out the fragments of glass  and cut his fingers and swore again 
1071,a drop of blood fell on the frame  another followed  spilling over on to the exposed photograph 
1072,he swore more vigorously  and dashed into the kitchen  where he bathed his hands 
1073,the kitchen was the same size as the sitting room  beyond it was a bedroom 
1074,this completed his home 
1075,he was renting the flat furnished  of all the objects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph frame  the cupids  and the books 
1076,damn  damn  damnation  he murmured  together with such other words as he had learnt from older men 
1077,then he raised his hand to his forehead and said  oh  damn it all   which meant something different 
1078,he pulled himself together 
1079,he drank a little tea  black and silent  that still survived upon an upper shelf 
1080,he swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake 
1081,then he went back to the sitting room  settled himself anew  and began to read a volume of ruskin 
1082,seven miles to the north of venice  
1083,how perfectly the famous chapter opens 
1084,how supreme its command of admonition and of poetry 
1085,the rich man is speaking to us from his gondola 
1086,seven miles to the north of venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low water mark attain by degrees a higher level  and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass  raised here and there into shapeless mounds  and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea 
1087,leonard was trying to form his style on ruskin  he understood him to be the greatest master of english prose 
1088,he read forward steadily  occasionally making a few notes 
1089,let us consider a little each of these characters in succession  and first  for of the shafts enough has been said already   what is very peculiar to this church  its luminousness 
1090,was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence 
1091,could he adapt it to the needs of daily life 
1092,could he introduce it  with modifications  when he next wrote a letter to his brother  the lay reader 
1093,for example 
1094,let us consider a little each of these characters in succession  and first  for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already   what is very peculiar to this flat  its obscurity 
1095,something told him that the modifications would not do  and that something  had he known it  was the spirit of english prose 
1096,my flat is dark as well as stuffy 
1097,those were the words for him 
1098,and the voice in the gondola rolled on  piping melodiously of effort and self sacrifice  full of high purpose  full of beauty  full even of sympathy and the love of men  yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in leonard s life 
1099,for it was the voice of one who had never been dirty or hungry  and had not guessed successfully what dirt and hunger are 
1100,leonard listened to it with reverence 
1101,he felt that he was being done good to  and that if he kept on with ruskin  and the queen s hall concerts  and some pictures by watts  he would one day push his head out of the grey waters and see the universe 
1102,he believed in sudden conversion  a belief which may be right  but which is peculiarly attractive to a half baked mind 
1103,it is the basis of much popular religion  in the domain of business it dominates the stock exchange  and becomes that bit of luck by which all successes and failures are explained 
1104,if only i had a bit of luck  the whole thing would come straight   
1105,he s got a most magnificent place down at streatham and a h p  fiat  but then  mind you  he s had luck   
1106,i m sorry the wife s so late  but she never has any luck over catching trains 
1107,leonard was superior to these people  he did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired 
1108,but of a heritage that may expand gradually  he had no conception  he hoped to come to culture suddenly  much as the revivalist hopes to come to jesus 
1109,those miss schlegels had come to it  they had done the trick  their hands were upon the ropes  once and for all 
1110,and meanwhile  his flat was dark  as well as stuffy 
1111,presently there was a noise on the staircase 
1112,he shut up margaret s card in the pages of ruskin  and opened the door 
1113,a woman entered  of whom it is simplest to say that she was not respectable 
1114,her appearance was awesome 
1115,she seemed all strings and bell pulls  ribbons  chains  bead necklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round her neck  with the ends uneven  her throat was bare  wound with a double row of pearls  her arms were bare to the elbows  and might again be detected at the shoulder  through cheap lace  her hat  which was flowery  resembled those punnets  covered with flannel  which we sowed with mustard and cress in our childhood  and which germinated here yes  and there no  she wore it on the back of her head  as for her hair  or rather hairs  they are too complicated to describe  but one system went down her back  lying in a thick pad there  while another  created for a lighter destiny  rippled around her forehead  the face  the face does not signify 
1116,it was the face of the photograph  but older  and the teeth were not so numerous as the photographer had suggested  and certainly not so white 
1117,yes  jacky was past her prime  whatever that prime may have been 
1118,she was descending quicker than most women into the colourless years  and the look in her eyes confessed it 
1119,what ho  said leonard  greeting the apparition with much spirit  and helping it off with its boa 
1120,jacky  in husky tones  replied  what ho 
1121,been out 
1122,he asked 
1123,the question sounds superfluous  but it cannot have been really  for the lady answered  no  adding  oh  i am so tired 
1124,you tired 
1125,i m tired  said he  hanging the boa up 
1126,oh  len  i am so tired 
1127,i ve been to that classical concert i told you about  said leonard 
1128,what s that 
1129,i came back as soon as it was over 
1130,any one been round to our place 
1131,asked jacky 
1132,not that i ve seen 
1133,i met mr  cunningham outside  and we passed a few remarks 
1134,what  not mr  cunningham 
1135,yes 
1136,oh  you mean mr  cunningham 
1137,yes 
1138,mr  cunningham 
1139,i ve been out to tea at a lady friend s 
1140,her secret being at last given  to the world  and the name of the lady friend being even adumbrated  jacky made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of conversation 
1141,she never had been a great talker 
1142,even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and her figure to attract  and now that she was
1143,on the shelf  on the shelf  boys  boys  i m on the shelf 
1144,she was not likely to find her tongue 
1145,occasional bursts of song  of which the above is an example  still issued from her lips  but the spoken word was rare 
1146,she sat down on leonard s knee  and began to fondle him 
1147,she was now a massive woman of thirty three  and her weight hurt him  but he could not very well say anything 
1148,then she said  is that a book you re reading 
1149,and he said  that s a book  and drew it from her unreluctant grasp 
1150,margaret s card fell out of it 
1151,it fell face downwards  and he murmured  bookmarker 
1152,len  
1153,what is it 
1154,he asked  a little wearily  for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his knee 
1155,you do love me 
1156,jacky  you know that i do 
1157,how can you ask such questions 
1158,but you do love me  len  don t you 
1159,of course i do 
1160,a pause 
1161,the other remark was still due 
1162,len  
1163,well 
1164,what is it 
1165,len  you will make it all right 
1166,i can t have you ask me that again  said the boy  flaring up into a sudden passion 
1167,i ve promised to marry you when i m of age  and that s enough 
1168,my word s my word 
1169,i ve promised to marry you as soon as ever i m twenty one  and i can t keep on being worried 
1170,i ve worries enough 
1171,it isn t likely i d throw you over  let alone my word  when i ve spent all this money 
1172,besides  i m an englishman  and i never go back on my word 
1173,jacky  do be reasonable 
1174,of course i ll marry you 
1175,only do stop badgering me 
1176,when s your birthday  len 
1177,i ve told you again and again  the eleventh of november next 
1178,now get off my knee a bit  some one must get supper  i suppose 
1179,jacky went through to the bedroom  and began to see to her hat 
1180,this meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs 
1181,leonard tidied up the sitting room  and began to prepare their evening meal 
1182,he put a penny into the slot of the gas meter  and soon the flat was reeking with metallic fumes 
1183,somehow he could not recover his temper  and all the time he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly 
1184,it really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted 
1185,it makes one feel so wild  when i ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife  all right  all right  you shall be my wife  and i ve bought you the ring to wear  and i ve taken this flat furnished  and it s far more than i can afford  and yet you aren t content  and i ve also not told the truth when i ve written home 
1186,he lowered his voice 
1187,he d stop it 
1188,in a tone of horror  that was a little luxurious  he repeated  my brother d stop it 
1189,i m going against the whole world  jacky 
1190,that s what i am  jacky 
1191,i don t take any heed of what any one says 
1192,i just go straight forward  i do 
1193,that s always been my way 
1194,i m not one of your weak knock kneed chaps 
1195,if a woman s in trouble  i don t leave her in the lurch 
1196,that s not my street 
1197,no  thank you 
1198,i ll tell you another thing too 
1199,i care a good deal about improving myself by means of literature and art  and so getting a wider outlook 
1200,for instance  when you came in i was reading ruskin s stones of venice 
1201,i don t say this to boast  but just to show you the kind of man i am 
1202,i can tell you  i enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon 
1203,to all his moods jacky remained equally indifferent 
1204,when supper was ready  and not before  she emerged from the bedroom  saying  but you do love me  don t you 
1205,they began with a soup square  which leonard had just dissolved in some hot water 
1206,it was followed by the tongue  a freckled cylinder of meat  with a little jelly at the top  and a great deal of yellow fat at the bottom  ending with another square dissolved in water  jelly  pineapple   which leonard had prepared earlier in the day 
1207,jacky ate contentedly enough  occasionally looking at her man with those anxious eyes  to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded  and which yet seemed to mirror her soul 
1208,and leonard managed to convince his stomach that it was having a nourishing meal 
1209,after supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements 
1210,she observed that her likeness had been broken 
1211,he found occasion to remark  for the second time  that he had come straight back home after the concert at queen s hall 
1212,presently she sat upon his knee 
1213,the inhabitants of camelia road tramped to and fro outside the window  just on a level with their heads  and the family in the flat on the ground floor began to sing  hark  my soul  it is the lord 
1214,that tune fairly gives me the hump  said leonard 
1215,jacky followed this  and said that  for her part  she thought it a lovely tune 
1216,no  i ll play you something lovely 
1217,get up  dear  for a minute 
1218,he went to the piano and jingled out a little grieg 
1219,he played badly and vulgarly  but the performance was not without its effect  for jacky said she thought she d be going to bed 
1220,as she receded  a new set of interests possessed the boy  and he began to think of what had been said about music by that odd miss schlegel  the one that twisted her face about so when she spoke  then the thoughts grew sad and envious  there was the girl named helen  who had pinched his umbrella  and the german girl who had smiled at him pleasantly  and herr some one  and aunt some one  and the brother  all  all with their hands on the ropes 
1221,they had all passed up that narrow  rich staircase at wickham place to some ample room  whither he could never follow them  not if he read for ten hours a day 
1222,oh  it was no good  this continual aspiration 
1223,some are born cultured  the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy 
1224,to see life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him 
1225,from the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called  len 
1226,you in bed 
1227,he asked  his forehead twitching 
1228,all right 
1229,presently she called him again 
1230,i must clean my boots ready for the morning  he answered 
1231,presently she called him again 
1232,i rather want to get this chapter done 
1233,what 
1234,he closed his ears against her 
1235,what s that 
1236,all right  jacky  nothing  i m reading a book 
1237,what 
1238,what 
1239,he answered  catching her degraded deafness 
1240,presently she called him again 
1241,ruskin had visited torcello by this time  and was ordering his gondoliers to take him to murano 
1242,it occurred to him  as he glided over the whispering lagoons  that the power of nature could not be shortened by the folly  nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such as leonard 
1243,oh  margaret  cried her aunt next morning  such a most unfortunate thing has happened 
1244,i could not get you alone 
1245,the most unfortunate thing was not very serious 
1246,one of the flats in the ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the wilcox family  coming up  no doubt  in the hope of getting into london society 
1247,that mrs  munt should be the first to discover the misfortune was not remarkable  for she was so interested in the flats  that she watched their every mutation with unwearying care 
1248,in theory she despised them  they took away that old world look  they cut off the sun  flats house a flashy type of person 
1249,but if the truth had been known  she found her visits to wickham place twice as amusing since wickham mansions had arisen  and would in a couple of days learn more about them than her nieces in a couple of months  or her nephew in a couple of years 
1250,she would stroll across and make friends with the porters  and inquire what the rents were  exclaiming for example  what  a hundred and twenty for a basement 
1251,you ll never get it 
1252,and they would answer  one can but try  madam 
1253,the passenger lifts  the arrangement for coals  a great temptation for a dishonest porter   were all familiar matters to her  and perhaps a relief from the politico economical esthetic atmosphere that reigned at the schlegels 
1254,margaret received the information calmly  and did not agree that it would throw a cloud over poor helen s life 
1255,oh  but helen isn t a girl with no interests  she explained 
1256,she has plenty of other things and other people to think about 
1257,she made a false start with the wilcoxes  and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them 
1258,for a clever girl  dear  how very oddly you do talk 
1259,helen ll have to have something more to do with them  now that they re all opposite 
1260,she may meet that paul in the street 
1261,she cannot very well not bow 
1262,of course she must bow 
1263,but look here  let s do the flowers 
1264,i was going to say  the will to be interested in him has died  and what else matters 
1265,i look on that disastrous episode  over which you were so kind  as the killing of a nerve in helen 
1266,it s dead  and she ll never be troubled with it again 
1267,the only things that matter are the things that interest one 
1268,bowing  even calling and leaving cards  even a dinner party  we can do all those things to the wilcoxes  if they find it agreeable  but the other thing  the one important thing  never again 
1269,don t you see 
1270,mrs  munt did not see  and indeed margaret was making a most questionable statement  that any emotion  any interest once vividly aroused  can wholly die 
1271,i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us 
1272,i didn t tell you at the time  it might have made you angry  and you had enough to worry you  but i wrote a letter to mrs  w  and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them 
1273,she didn t answer it 
1274,how very rude 
1275,i wonder 
1276,or was it sensible 
1277,no  margaret  most rude 
1278,in either case one can class it as reassuring 
1279,mrs  munt sighed 
1280,she was going back to swanage on the morrow  just as her nieces were wanting her most 
1281,other regrets crowded upon her  for instance  how magnificently she would have cut charles if she had met him face to face 
1282,she had already seen him  giving an order to the porter  and very common he looked in a tall hat 
1283,but unfortunately his back was turned to her  and though she had cut his back  she could not regard this as a telling snub 
1284,but you will be careful  won t you 
1285,she exhorted 
1286,oh  certainly 
1287,fiendishly careful 
1288,and helen must be careful  too 
1289,careful over what 
1290,cried helen  at that moment coming into the room with her cousin 
1291,nothing said margaret  seized with a momentary awkwardness 
1292,careful over what  aunt juley 
1293,mrs  munt assumed a cryptic air 
1294,it is only that a certain family  whom we know by name but do not mention  as you said yourself last night after the concert  have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons  where the plants are in the balcony 
1295,helen began some laughing reply  and then disconcerted them all by blushing 
1296,mrs  munt was so disconcerted that she exclaimed  what  helen  you don t mind them coming  do you 
1297,and deepened the blush to crimson 
1298,of course i don t mind  said helen a little crossly 
1299,it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it  when there s nothing to be grave about at all 
1300,i m not grave  protested margaret  a little cross in her turn 
1301,well  you look grave  doesn t she  frieda 
1302,i don t feel grave  that s all i can say  you re going quite on the wrong tack 
1303,no  she does not feel grave  echoed mrs  munt 
1304,i can bear witness to that 
1305,she disagrees  
1306,hark  interrupted fraulein mosebach 
1307,i hear bruno entering the hall 
1308,for herr liesecke was due at wickham place to call for the two younger girls 
1309,he was not entering the hall  in fact  he did not enter it for quite five minutes 
1310,but frieda detected a delicate situation  and said that she and helen had much better wait for bruno down below  and leave margaret and mrs  munt to finish arranging the flowers 
1311,helen acquiesced 
1312,but  as if to prove that the situation was not delicate really  she stopped in the doorway and said 
1313,did you say the mathesons flat  aunt juley 
1314,how wonderful you are 
1315,i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson 
1316,come  helen  said her cousin 
1317,go  helen  said her aunt  and continued to margaret almost in the same breath  helen cannot deceive me 
1318,she does mind 
1319,oh  hush  breathed margaret 
1320,frieda ll hear you  and she can be so tiresome 
1321,she minds  persisted mrs  munt  moving thoughtfully about the room  and pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases 
1322,i knew she d mind  and i m sure a girl ought to 
1323,such an experience 
1324,such awful coarse grained people 
1325,i know more about them than you do  which you forget  and if charles had taken you that motor drive  well  you d have reached the house a perfect wreck 
1326,oh  margaret  you don t know what you are in for 
1327,they re all bottled up against the drawing room window 
1328,there s mrs  wilcox  i ve seen her  there s paul  there s evie  who is a minx  there s charles  i saw him to start with 
1329,and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be 
1330,mr  wilcox  possibly 
1331,i knew it 
1332,and there s mr  wilcox 
1333,it s a shame to call his face copper colour  complained margaret 
1334,he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age 
1335,mrs  munt  triumphant elsewhere  could afford to concede mr  wilcox his complexion 
1336,she passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her nieces should pursue in the future 
1337,margaret tried to stop her 
1338,helen did not take the news quite as i expected  but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really  so there s no need for plans 
1339,it s as well to be prepared 
1340,no  it s as well not to be prepared 
1341,why 
1342,because  
1343,her thought drew being from the obscure borderland 
1344,she could not explain in so many words  but she felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy 
1345,it is necessary to prepare for an examination  or a dinner party  or a possible fall in the price of stock  those who attempt human relations must adopt another method  or fail 
1346,because i d sooner risk it  was her lame conclusion 
1347,but imagine the evenings  exclaimed her aunt  pointing to the mansions with the spout of the watering can 
1348,turn the electric light on here or there  and it s almost the same room 
1349,one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down  and you ll see them  and the next  you yours  and they ll see you 
1350,impossible to sit out on the balconies 
1351,impossible to water the plants  or even speak 
1352,imagine going out of the front door  and they come out opposite at the same moment 
1353,and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary  and you d rather risk it 
1354,i hope to risk things all my life 
1355,oh  margaret  most dangerous 
1356,but after all  she continued with a smile  there s never any great risk as long as you have money 
1357,oh  shame 
1358,what a shocking speech 
1359,money pads the edges of things  said miss schlegel 
1360,god help those who have none 
1361,but this is something quite new  said mrs  munt  who collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts  and was especially attracted by those that are portable 
1362,new for me  sensible people have acknowledged it for years 
1363,you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands 
1364,it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence 
1365,it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means 
1366,last night  when we were talking up here round the fire  i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic  and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love  but the absence of coin 
1367,i call that rather cynical 
1368,so do i  but helen and i  we ought to remember  when we are tempted to criticise others  that we are standing on these islands  and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea 
1369,the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love  and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer 
1370,we rich can 
1371,imagine the tragedy last june  if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people  and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them 
1372,that s more like socialism  said mrs  munt suspiciously 
1373,call it what you like 
1374,i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table 
1375,i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor  and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves 
1376,i stand each year upon six hundred pounds  and helen upon the same  and tibby will stand upon eight  and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed  from the sea  yes  from the sea 
1377,and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders  and all our speeches  and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves  we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes  and that what s a joke up here is down there reality 
1378,there they go  there goes fraulein mosebach  really  for a german she does dress charmingly  oh   
1379,what is it 
1380,helen was looking up at the wilcoxes flat 
1381,why shouldn t she 
1382,i beg your pardon  i interrupted you 
1383,what was it you were saying about reality 
1384,i had worked round to myself  as usual  answered margaret in tones that were suddenly preoccupied 
1385,do tell me this  at all events 
1386,are you for the rich or for the poor 
1387,too difficult 
1388,ask me another 
1389,am i for poverty or for riches 
1390,for riches 
1391,hurrah for riches 
1392,for riches  echoed mrs  munt  having  as it were  at last secured her nut 
1393,yes 
1394,for riches 
1395,money for ever 
1396,so am i  and so  i am afraid  are most of my acquaintances at swanage  but i am surprised that you agree with us 
1397,thank you so much  aunt juley 
1398,while i have talked theories  you have done the flowers 
1399,not at all  dear 
1400,i wish you would let me help you in more important things 
1401,well  would you be very kind 
1402,would you come round with me to the registry office 
1403,there s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no 
1404,on their way thither they too looked up at the wilcoxes flat 
1405,evie was in the balcony  staring most rudely  according to mrs  munt 
1406,oh yes  it was a nuisance  there was no doubt of it 
1407,helen was proof against a passing encounter  but  margaret began to lose confidence  might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes  and frieda mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight  and frieda was sharp  abominably sharp  and quite capable of remarking  you love one of the young gentlemen opposite  yes  the remark would be untrue  but of the kind which  if stated often enough  may become true  just as the remark  england and germany are bound to fight  renders war a little more likely each time that it is made  and is therefore made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation  have the private emotions also their gutter press  margaret thought so  and feared that good aunt juley and frieda were typical specimens of it  they might  by continual chatter  lead helen into a repetition of the desires of june  into a repetition  they could not do more  they could not lead her into lasting love 
1408,they were  she saw it clearly  journalism  her father  with all his defects and wrong headedness  had been literature  and had he lived  he would have persuaded his daughter rightly 
1409,the registry office was holding its morning reception 
1410,a string of carriages filled the street 
1411,miss schlegel waited her turn  and finally had to be content with an insidious temporary  being rejected by genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs 
1412,her failure depressed her  and though she forgot the failure  the depression remained 
1413,on her way home she again glanced up at the wilcoxes flat  and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to helen 
1414,helen  you must tell me whether this thing worries you 
1415,if what 
1416,said helen  who was washing her hands for lunch 
1417,the ws coming 
1418,no  of course not 
1419,really 
1420,really 
1421,then she admitted that she was a little worried on mrs  wilcox s account  she implied that mrs  wilcox might reach backward into deep feelings  and be pained by things that never touched the other members of that clan 
1422,i shan t mind if paul points at our house and says  there lives the girl who tried to catch me 
1423,but she might 
1424,if even that worries you  we could arrange something 
1425,there s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease  thanks to our money 
1426,we might even go away for a little 
1427,well  i am going away 
1428,frieda s just asked me to stettin  and i shan t be back till after the new year 
1429,will that do 
1430,or must i fly the country altogether 
1431,really  meg  what has come over you to make such a fuss 
1432,oh  i m getting an old maid  i suppose 
1433,i thought i minded nothing  but really i  i should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and   she cleared her throat   you did go red  you know  when aunt juley attacked you this morning 
1434,i shouldn t have referred to it otherwise 
1435,but helen s laugh rang true  as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never  nowhere and nohow  would she again fall in love with any of the wilcox family  down to its remotest collaterals 
1436,the friendship between margaret and mrs  wilcox  which was to develop so quickly and with such strange results  may perhaps have had its beginnings at speyer  in the spring 
1437,perhaps the elder lady  as she gazed at the vulgar  ruddy cathedral  and listened to the talk of her husband and helen  may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy  a sounder judgment 
1438,she was capable of detecting such things 
1439,perhaps it was she who had desired the miss schlegels to be invited to howards end  and margaret whose presence she had particularly desired 
1440,all this is speculation  mrs  wilcox has left few clear indications behind her 
1441,it is certain that she came to call at wickham place a fortnight later  the very day that helen was going with her cousin to stettin 
1442,helen  cried fraulein mosebach in awestruck tones  she was now in her cousin s confidence    his mother has forgiven you 
1443,and then  remembering that in england the new comer ought not to call before she is called upon  she changed her tone from awe to disapproval  and opined that mrs  wilcox was keine dame 
1444,bother the whole family  snapped margaret 
1445,helen  stop giggling and pirouetting  and go and finish your packing 
1446,why can t the woman leave us alone 
1447,i don t know what i shall do with meg  helen retorted  collapsing upon the stairs 
1448,she s got wilcox and box upon the brain 
1449,meg  meg  i don t love the young gentleman  i don t love the young gentleman  meg  meg 
1450,can a body speak plainer 
1451,most certainly her love has died  asserted fraulein mosebach 
1452,most certainly it has  frieda  but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call 
1453,then helen simulated tears  and fraulein mosebach  who thought her extremely amusing  did the same 
1454,oh  boo hoo  boo hoo hoo 
1455,meg s going to return the call  and i can t 
1456,cos why 
1457,cos i m going to german eye 
1458,if you are going to germany  go and pack  if you aren t  go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me 
1459,but  meg  meg  i don t love the young gentleman  i don t love the young  o lud  who s that coming down the stairs 
1460,i vow it is my brother 
1461,o crimini 
1462,a male  even such a male as tibby  was enough to stop the foolery 
1463,the barrier of sex  though decreasing among the civilised  is still high  and higher on the side of women 
1464,helen could tell her sister all  and her cousin much about paul  she told her brother nothing 
1465,it was not prudishness  for she now spoke of the wilcox ideal with laughter  and even with a growing brutality 
1466,nor was it precaution  for tibby seldom repeated any news that did not concern himself 
1467,it was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men  and that  however trivial it was on this side of the barrier  it would become important on that 
1468,so she stopped  or rather began to fool on other subjects  until her long suffering relatives drove her upstairs 
1469,fraulein mosebach followed her  but lingered to say heavily over the banisters to margaret  it is all right  she does not love the young man  he has not been worthy of her 
1470,yes  i know  thanks very much 
1471,i thought i did right to tell you 
1472,ever so many thanks 
1473,what s that 
1474,asked tibby 
1475,no one told him  and he proceeded into the dining room  to eat plums 
1476,that evening margaret took decisive action 
1477,the house was very quiet  and the fog  we are in november now  pressed against the windows like an excluded ghost 
1478,frieda and helen and all their luggages had gone 
1479,tibby  who was not feeling well  lay stretched on a sofa by the fire 
1480,margaret sat by him  thinking 
1481,her mind darted from impulse to impulse  and finally marshalled them all in review 
1482,the practical person  who knows what he wants at once  and generally knows nothing else  will accuse her of indecision 
1483,but this was the way her mind worked 
1484,and when she did act  no one could accuse her of indecision then 
1485,she hit out as lustily as if she had not considered the matter at all 
1486,the letter that she wrote mrs  wilcox glowed with the native hue of resolution 
1487,the pale cast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish  a breath that leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away 
1488,dear mrs  wilcox 
1489,i have to write something discourteous 
1490,it would be better if we did not meet 
1491,both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family  and  in my sister s case  the grounds for displeasure might recur 
1492,so far as i know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son 
1493,but it would not be fair  either to her or to you  if they met  and it is therefore right that our acquaintance  which began so pleasantly  should end 
1494,i fear that you will not agree with this  indeed  i know that you will not  since you have been good enough to call on us 
1495,it is only an instinct on my part  and no doubt the instinct is wrong 
1496,my sister would  undoubtedly  say that it is wrong 
1497,i write without her knowledge  and i hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy 
1498,believe me 
1499,yours truly 
1500,m  j  schlegel 
1501,margaret sent this letter round by the post 
1502,next morning she received the following reply by hand 
1503,dear miss schlegel 
1504,you should not have written me such a letter 
1505,i called to tell you that paul has gone abroad 
1506,ruth wilcox 
1507,margaret s cheeks burnt 
1508,she could not finish her breakfast 
1509,she was on fire with shame 
1510,helen had told her that the youth was leaving england  but other things had seemed more important  and she had forgotten 
1511,all her absurd anxieties fell to the ground  and in their place arose the certainty that she had been rude to mrs  wilcox 
1512,rudeness affected margaret like a bitter taste in the mouth 
1513,it poisoned life 
1514,at times it is necessary  but woe to those who employ it without due need 
1515,she flung on a hat and shawl  just like a poor woman  and plunged into the fog  which still continued 
1516,her lips were compressed  the letter remained in her hand  and in this state she crossed the street  entered the marble vestibule of the flats  eluded the concierges  and ran up the stairs till she reached the second floor 
1517,she sent in her name  and to her surprise was shown straight into mrs  wilcox s bedroom 
1518,oh  mrs  wilcox  i have made the baddest blunder 
1519,i am more  more ashamed and sorry than i can say 
1520,mrs  wilcox bowed gravely 
1521,she was offended  and did not pretend to the contrary 
1522,she was sitting up in bed  writing letters on an invalid table that spanned her knees 
1523,a breakfast tray was on another table beside her 
1524,the light of the fire  the light from the window  and the light of a candle lamp  which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to create a strange atmosphere of dissolution 
1525,i knew he was going to india in november  but i forgot 
1526,he sailed on the th for nigeria  in africa 
1527,i knew  i know 
1528,i have been too absurd all through 
1529,i am very much ashamed 
1530,mrs  wilcox did not answer 
1531,i am more sorry than i can say  and i hope that you will forgive me 
1532,it doesn t matter  miss schlegel 
1533,it is good of you to have come round so promptly 
1534,it does matter  cried margaret 
1535,i have been rude to you  and my sister is not even at home  so there was not even that excuse 
1536,indeed 
1537,she has just gone to germany 
1538,she gone as well  murmured the other 
1539,yes  certainly  it is quite safe  safe  absolutely  now 
1540,you ve been worrying too  exclaimed margaret  getting more and more excited  and taking a chair without invitation 
1541,how perfectly extraordinary 
1542,i can see that you have 
1543,you felt as i do  helen mustn t meet him again 
1544,i did think it best 
1545,now why 
1546,that s a most difficult question  said mrs  wilcox  smiling  and a little losing her expression of annoyance 
1547,i think you put it best in your letter  it was an instinct  which may be wrong 
1548,it wasn t that your son still  
1549,oh no  he often  my paul is very young  you see 
1550,then what was it 
1551,she repeated  an instinct which may be wrong 
1552,in other words  they belong to types that can fall in love  but couldn t live together 
1553,that s dreadfully probable 
1554,i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another 
1555,these are indeed other words  said mrs  wilcox 
1556,i had nothing so coherent in my head 
1557,i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister 
1558,ah  i have always been wanting to ask you 
1559,how did you know 
1560,helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up  and you stepped forward and arranged things 
1561,did paul tell you 
1562,there is nothing to be gained by discussing that  said mrs  wilcox after a moment s pause 
1563,mrs  wilcox  were you very angry with us last june 
1564,i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it 
1565,i was certainly against taking mrs  matheson s flat 
1566,i knew it was opposite your house 
1567,but it s all right now 
1568,i think so 
1569,you only think 
1570,you aren t sure 
1571,i do love these little muddles tidied up 
1572,oh yes  i m sure  said mrs  wilcox  moving with uneasiness beneath the clothes 
1573,i always sound uncertain over things 
1574,it is my way of speaking 
1575,that s all right  and i m sure  too 
1576,here the maid came in to remove the breakfast tray 
1577,they were interrupted  and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal lines 
1578,i must say good bye now  you will be getting up 
1579,no  please stop a little longer  i am taking a day in bed 
1580,now and then i do 
1581,i thought of you as one of the early risers 
1582,at howards end  yes  there is nothing to get up for in london 
1583,nothing to get up for 
1584,cried the scandalised margaret 
1585,when there are all the autumn exhibitions  and ysaye playing in the afternoon 
1586,not to mention people 
1587,the truth is  i am a little tired 
1588,first came the wedding  and then paul went off  and  instead of resting yesterday  i paid a round of calls 
1589,a wedding 
1590,yes  charles  my elder son  is married 
1591,indeed 
1592,we took the flat chiefly on that account  and also that paul could get his african outfit 
1593,the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s  and she most kindly offered it to us 
1594,so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly s people  which we had not yet done 
1595,margaret asked who dolly s people were 
1596,fussell 
1597,the father is in the indian army  retired  the brother is in the army 
1598,the mother is dead 
1599,so perhaps these were the chinless sunburnt men whom helen had espied one afternoon through the window 
1600,margaret felt mildly interested in the fortunes of the wilcox family 
1601,she had acquired the habit on helen s account  and it still clung to her 
1602,she asked for more information about miss dolly fussell that was  and was given it in even  unemotional tones 
1603,mrs  wilcox s voice  though sweet and compelling  had little range of expression 
1604,it suggested that pictures  concerts  and people are all of small and equal value 
1605,only once had it quickened  when speaking of howards end 
1606,charles and albert fussell have known one another some time 
1607,they belong to the same club  and are both devoted to golf 
1608,dolly plays golf too  though i believe not so well  and they first met in a mixed foursome 
1609,we all like her  and are very much pleased 
1610,they were married on the th  a few days before paul sailed 
1611,charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man  so he made a great point of having it on the th 
1612,the fussells would have preferred it after christmas  but they were very nice about it 
1613,there is dolly s photograph  in that double frame 
1614,are you quite certain that i m not interrupting  mrs  wilcox 
1615,yes  quite 
1616,then i will stay 
1617,i m enjoying this 
1618,dolly s photograph was now examined 
1619,it was signed for dear mims  which mrs  wilcox interpreted as the name she and charles had settled that she should call me 
1620,dolly looked silly  and had one of those triangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man 
1621,she was very pretty 
1622,from her margaret passed to charles  whose features prevailed opposite 
1623,she speculated on the forces that had drawn the two together till god parted them 
1624,she found time to hope that they would be happy 
1625,they have gone to naples for their honeymoon 
1626,lucky people 
1627,i can hardly imagine charles in italy 
1628,doesn t he care for travelling 
1629,he likes travel  but he does see through foreigners so 
1630,what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england  and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable 
1631,his father gave him a car for a wedding present  which for the present is being stored at howards end 
1632,i suppose you have a garage there 
1633,yes 
1634,my husband built a little one only last month  to the west of the house  not far from the wych elm  in what used to be the paddock for the pony 
1635,the last words had an indescribable ring about them 
1636,where s the pony gone 
1637,asked margaret after a pause 
1638,the pony 
1639,oh  dead  ever so long ago 
1640,the wych elm i remember 
1641,helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree 
1642,it is the finest wych elm in hertfordshire 
1643,did your sister tell you about the teeth 
1644,oh  it might interest you 
1645,there are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk  about four feet from the ground 
1646,the country people put them in long ago  and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark  it will cure the toothache 
1647,the teeth are almost grown over now  and no one comes to the tree 
1648,i should 
1649,i love folklore and all festering superstitions 
1650,do you think that the tree really did cure toothache  if one believed in it 
1651,of course it did 
1652,it would cure anything  once 
1653,certainly i remember cases  you see i lived at howards end long  long before mr  wilcox knew it 
1654,i was born there 
1655,the conversation again shifted 
1656,at the time it seemed little more than aimless chatter 
1657,she was interested when her hostess explained that howards end was her own property 
1658,she was bored when too minute an account was given of the fussell family  of the anxieties of charles concerning naples  of the movements of mr  wilcox and evie  who were motoring in yorkshire 
1659,margaret could not bear being bored 
1660,she grew inattentive  played with the photograph frame  dropped it  smashed dolly s glass  apologised  was pardoned  cut her finger thereon  was pitied  and finally said she must be going  there was all the housekeeping to do  and she had to interview tibby s riding master 
1661,then the curious note was struck again 
1662,good bye  miss schlegel  good bye 
1663,thank you for coming 
1664,you have cheered me up 
1665,i m so glad 
1666,i  i wonder whether you ever think about yourself 
1667,i think of nothing else  said margaret  blushing  but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid 
1668,i wonder 
1669,i wondered at heidelberg 
1670,i m sure 
1671,i almost think  
1672,yes 
1673,asked margaret  for there was a long pause  a pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire  the quiver of the reading lamp upon their hands  the white blur from the window  a pause of shifting and eternal shadows 
1674,i almost think you forget you re a girl 
1675,margaret was startled and a little annoyed 
1676,i m twenty nine  she remarked 
1677,that s not so wildly girlish 
1678,mrs  wilcox smiled 
1679,what makes you say that 
1680,do you mean that i have been gauche and rude 
1681,a shake of the head 
1682,i only meant that i am fifty one  and that to me both of you  read it all in some book or other  i cannot put things clearly 
1683,oh  i ve got it  inexperience 
1684,i m no better than helen  you mean  and yet i presume to advise her 
1685,yes 
1686,you have got it 
1687,inexperience is the word 
1688,inexperience  repeated margaret  in serious yet buoyant tones 
1689,of course  i have everything to learn  absolutely everything  just as much as helen 
1690,life s very difficult and full of surprises 
1691,at all events  i ve got as far as that 
1692,to be humble and kind  to go straight ahead  to love people rather than pity them  to remember the submerged  well  one can t do all these things at once  worse luck  because they re so contradictory  it s then that proportion comes in  to live by proportion 
1693,don t begin with proportion 
1694,only prigs do that 
1695,let proportion come in as a last resource  when the better things have failed  and a deadlock  gracious me  i ve started preaching 
1696,indeed  you put the difficulties of life splendidly  said mrs  wilcox  withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows 
1697,it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself 
1698,mrs  wilcox cannot be accused of giving margaret much information about life 
1699,and margaret  on the other hand  has made a fair show of modesty  and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel 
1700,she had kept house for over ten years  she had entertained  almost with distinction  she had brought up a charming sister  and was bringing up a brother 
1701,surely  if experience is attainable  she had attained it 
1702,yet the little luncheon party that she gave in mrs  wilcox s honour was not a success 
1703,the new friend did not blend with the one or two delightful people who had been asked to meet her  and the atmosphere was one of polite bewilderment 
1704,her tastes were simple  her knowledge of culture slight  and she was not interested in the new english art club  nor in the dividing line between journalism and literature  which was started as a conversational hare 
1705,the delightful people darted after it with cries of joy  margaret leading them  and not till the meal was half over did they realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the chase 
1706,there was no common topic 
1707,mrs  wilcox  whose life had been spent in the service of husband and sons  had little to say to strangers who had never shared it  and whose age was half her own 
1708,clever talk alarmed her  and withered her delicate imaginings  it was the social counterpart of a motor car  all jerks  and she was a wisp of hay  a flower 
1709,twice she deplored the weather  twice criticised the train service on the great northern railway 
1710,they vigorously assented  and rushed on  and when she inquired whether there was any news of helen  her hostess was too much occupied in placing rothenstein to answer 
1711,the question was repeated  hope that your sister is safe in germany by now 
1712,margaret checked herself and said  yes  thank you  heard on tuesday 
1713,but the demon of vociferation was in her  and the next moment she was off again 
1714,only on tuesday  for they live right away at stettin 
1715,did you ever know any one living at stettin 
1716,never  said mrs  wilcox gravely  while her neighbour  a young man low down in the education office  began to discuss what people who lived at stettin ought to look like 
1717,was there such a thing as stettininity 
1718,margaret swept on 
1719,people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses 
1720,at least  our cousins do  but aren t particularly rich 
1721,the town isn t interesting  except for a clock that rolls its eyes  and the view of the oder  which truly is something special 
1722,oh  mrs  wilcox  you would love the oder 
1723,the river  or rather rivers  there seem to be dozens of them  are intense blue  and the plain they run through an intensest green 
1724,indeed 
1725,that sounds like a most beautiful view  miss schlegel 
1726,so say  but helen  who will muddle things  says no  it s like music 
1727,the course of the oder is to be like music 
1728,it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem 
1729,the part by the landing stage is in b minor  if remember rightly  but lower down things get extremely mixed 
1730,there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once  meaning mud banks  and another for the navigable canal  and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major  pianissimo 
1731,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that 
1732,asked the man  laughing 
1733,they make a great deal of it  replied margaret  unexpectedly rushing off on a new track 
1734,think it s affectation to compare the oder to music  and so do you  but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously  which we don t  and the average englishman doesn t  and despises all who do 
1735,now don t say germans have no taste  or shall scream 
1736,they haven t 
1737,but  but  such a tremendous but   they take poetry seriously 
1738,they do take poetry seriously 
1739,is anything gained by that 
1740,yes  yes 
1741,the german is always on the lookout for beauty 
1742,he may miss it through stupidity  or misinterpret it  but he is always asking beauty to enter his life  and believe that in the end it will come 
1743,at heidelberg met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry 
1744,so easy for me to laugh  i  who never repeat poetry  good or bad  and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with  my blood boils  well  m half german  so put it down to patriotism  when listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic  whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon  oh  bocklin  they say  he strains after beauty  he peoples nature with gods too consciously  of course bocklin strains  because he wants something  beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world 
1745,so his landscapes don t come off  and leader s do 
1746,am not sure that agree 
1747,do you 
1748,said he  turning to mrs  wilcox 
1749,she replied  think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly  and a chill fell on the conversation 
1750,oh  mrs  wilcox  say something nicer than that 
1751,it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly 
1752,do not mean it as a snub 
1753,your last speech interested me so much 
1754,generally people do not seem quite to like germany 
1755,have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side 
1756,the other side 
1757,then you do disagree 
1758,oh  good 
1759,give us your side 
1760,have no side 
1761,but my husband   her voice softened  the chill increased   has very little faith in the continent  and our children have all taken after him 
1762,on what grounds 
1763,do they feel that the continent is in bad form 
1764,mrs  wilcox had no idea  she paid little attention to grounds 
1765,she was not intellectual  nor even alert  and it was odd that  all the same  she should give the idea of greatness 
1766,margaret  zigzagging with her friends over thought and art  was conscious of a personality that transcended their own and dwarfed their activities 
1767,there was no bitterness in mrs  wilcox  there was not even criticism  she was lovable  and no ungracious or uncharitable word had passed her lips 
1768,yet she and daily life were out of focus  one or the other must show blurred 
1769,and at lunch she seemed more out of focus than usual  and nearer the line that divides daily life from a life that may be of greater importance 
1770,you will admit  though  that the continent  it seems silly to speak of the continent  but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england 
1771,england is unique 
1772,do have another jelly first 
1773,was going to say that the continent  for good or for evil  is interested in ideas 
1774,its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them  and this persists even through decadence and affectation 
1775,there is more liberty of action in england  but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia 
1776,people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs 
1777,do not want to go to prussia  said mrs  wilcox not even to see that interesting view that you were describing 
1778,and for discussing with humility am too old 
1779,we never discuss anything at howards end 
1780,then you ought to  said margaret 
1781,discussion keeps a house alive 
1782,it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone 
1783,it cannot stand without them  said mrs  wilcox  unexpectedly catching on to the thought  and rousing  for the first and last time  a faint hope in the breasts of the delightful people 
1784,it cannot stand without them  and sometimes think  but cannot expect your generation to agree  for even my daughter disagrees with me here 
1785,never mind us or her 
1786,do say 
1787,sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men 
1788,there was a little silence 
1789,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong  said a girl opposite  leaning forward and crumbling her bread 
1790,are they 
1791,never follow any arguments 
1792,am only too thankful not to have a vote myself 
1793,we didn t mean the vote  though  did we 
1794,supplied margaret 
1795,aren t we differing on something much wider  mrs  wilcox 
1796,whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history  or whether  since men have moved forward so far  they too may move forward a little now 
1797,say they may  would even admit a biological change 
1798,don t know  don t know 
1799,must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse  said the man 
1800,they ve turned disgracefully strict 
1801,mrs  wilcox also rose 
1802,oh  but come upstairs for a little 
1803,miss quested plays 
1804,do you like macdowell 
1805,do you mind his only having two noises 
1806,if you must really go  ll see you out 
1807,won t you even have coffee 
1808,they left the dining room closing the door behind them  and as mrs  wilcox buttoned up her jacket  she said  what an interesting life you all lead in london 
1809,no  we don t  said margaret  with a sudden revulsion 
1810,we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys 
1811,mrs  wilcox  really  we have something quiet and stable at the bottom 
1812,we really have 
1813,all my friends have 
1814,don t pretend you enjoyed lunch  for you loathed it  but forgive me by coming again  alone  or by asking me to you 
1815,am used to young people  said mrs  wilcox  and with each word she spoke the outlines of known things grew dim 
1816,hear a great deal of chatter at home  for we  like you  entertain a great deal 
1817,with us it is more sport and politics  but  enjoyed my lunch very much  miss schlegel  dear  and am not pretending  and only wish could have joined in more 
1818,for one thing  m not particularly well just to day 
1819,for another  you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me 
1820,charles is the same  dolly the same 
1821,but we are all in the same boat  old and young 
1822,never forget that 
1823,they were silent for a moment 
1824,then  with a newborn emotion  they shook hands 
1825,the conversation ceased suddenly when margaret re entered the dining room  her friends had been talking over her new friend  and had dismissed her as uninteresting 
1826,several days passed 
1827,was mrs  wilcox one of the unsatisfactory people  there are many of them  who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it 
1828,they evoke our interests and affections  and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them 
1829,then they withdraw 
1830,when physical passion is involved  there is a definite name for such behaviour  flirting  and if carried far enough it is punishable by law 
1831,but no law  not public opinion even  punishes those who coquette with friendship  though the dull ache that they inflict  the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion  may be as intolerable 
1832,was she one of these 
1833,margaret feared so at first  for  with a londoner s impatience  she wanted everything to be settled up immediately 
1834,she mistrusted the periods of quiet that are essential to true growth 
1835,desiring to book mrs  wilcox as a friend  she pressed on the ceremony  pencil  as it were  in hand  pressing the more because the rest of the family were away  and the opportunity seemed favourable 
1836,but the elder woman would not be hurried 
1837,she refused to fit in with the wickham place set  or to reopen discussion of helen and paul  whom margaret would have utilised as a short cut 
1838,she took her time  or perhaps let time take her  and when the crisis did come all was ready 
1839,the crisis opened with a message  would miss schlegel come shopping 
1840,christmas was nearing  and mrs  wilcox felt behindhand with the presents 
1841,she had taken some more days in bed  and must make up for lost time 
1842,margaret accepted  and at eleven o clock one cheerless morning they started out in a brougham 
1843,first of all  began margaret  we must make a list and tick off the people s names 
1844,my aunt always does  and this fog may thicken up any moment 
1845,have you any ideas 
1846,thought we would go to harrods or the haymarket stores  said mrs  wilcox rather hopelessly 
1847,everything is sure to be there 
1848,am not a good shopper 
1849,the din is so confusing  and your aunt is quite right  one ought to make a list 
1850,take my notebook  then  and write your own name at the top of the page 
1851,oh  hooray  said margaret  writing it 
1852,how very kind of you to start with me 
1853,but she did not want to receive anything expensive 
1854,their acquaintance was singular rather than intimate  and she divined that the wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders  the more compact families do 
1855,she did not want to be thought a second helen  who would snatch presents since she could not snatch young men  nor to be exposed like a second aunt juley  to the insults of charles 
1856,a certain austerity of demeanour was best  and she added  don t really want a yuletide gift  though 
1857,in fact  d rather not 
1858,why 
1859,because ve odd ideas about christmas 
1860,because have all that money can buy 
1861,want more people  but no more things 
1862,should like to give you something worth your acquaintance  miss schlegel  in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight 
1863,it has so happened that have been left alone  and you have stopped me from brooding 
1864,am too apt to brood 
1865,if that is so  said margaret  if have happened to be of use to you  which didn t know  you cannot pay me back with anything tangible 
1866,suppose not  but one would like to 
1867,perhaps shall think of something as we go about 
1868,her name remained at the head of the list  but nothing was written opposite it 
1869,they drove from shop to shop 
1870,the air was white  and when they alighted it tasted like cold pennies 
1871,at times they passed through a clot of grey 
1872,mrs  wilcox s vitality was low that morning  and it was margaret who decided on a horse for this little girl  a golliwog for that  for the rector s wife a copper warming tray 
1873,we always give the servants money 
1874,yes  do you  yes  much easier  replied margaret but felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen  and saw issuing from a forgotten manger at bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys 
1875,vulgarity reigned 
1876,public houses  besides their usual exhortation against temperance reform  invited men to join our christmas goose club   one bottle of gin  etc   or two  according to subscription 
1877,a poster of a woman in tights heralded the christmas pantomime  and little red devils  who had come in again that year  were prevalent upon the christmas cards 
1878,margaret was no morbid idealist 
1879,she did not wish this spate of business and self advertisement checked 
1880,it was only the occasion of it that struck her with amazement annually 
1881,how many of these vacillating shoppers and tired shop assistants realised that it was a divine event that drew them together 
1882,she realised it  though standing outside in the matter 
1883,she was not a christian in the accepted sense  she did not believe that god had ever worked among us as a young artisan 
1884,these people  or most of them  believed it  and if pressed  would affirm it in words 
1885,but the visible signs of their belief were regent street or drury lane  a little mud displaced  a little money spent  a little food cooked  eaten  and forgotten 
1886,inadequate 
1887,but in public who shall express the unseen adequately 
1888,it is private life that holds out the mirror to infinity  personal intercourse  and that alone  that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision 
1889,no  do like christmas on the whole  she announced 
1890,in its clumsy way  it does approach peace and goodwill 
1891,but oh  it is clumsier every year 
1892,is it 
1893,am only used to country christmases 
1894,we are usually in london  and play the game with vigour  carols at the abbey  clumsy midday meal  clumsy dinner for the maids  followed by christmas tree and dancing of poor children  with songs from helen 
1895,the drawing room does very well for that 
1896,we put the tree in the powder closet  and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted  and with the looking glass behind it looks quite pretty 
1897,wish we might have a powder closet in our next house 
1898,of course  the tree has to be very small  and the presents don t hang on it 
1899,no  the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper 
1900,you spoke of your next house  miss schlegel 
1901,then are you leaving wickham place 
1902,yes  in two or three years  when the lease expires 
1903,we must 
1904,have you been there long 
1905,all our lives 
1906,you will be very sorry to leave it 
1907,suppose so 
1908,we scarcely realise it yet 
1909,my father   she broke off  for they had reached the stationery department of the haymarket stores  and mrs  wilcox wanted to order some private greeting cards 
1910,if possible  something distinctive  she sighed 
1911,at the counter she found a friend  bent on the same errand  and conversed with her insipidly  wasting much time 
1912,my husband and our daughter are motoring 
1913,bertha  too 
1914,oh  fancy  what a coincidence 
1915,margaret  though not practical  could shine in such company as this 
1916,while they talked  she went through a volume of specimen cards  and submitted one for mrs  wilcox s inspection 
1917,mrs  wilcox was delighted  so original  words so sweet  she would order a hundred like that  and could never be sufficiently grateful 
1918,then  just as the assistant was booking the order  she said  do you know  ll wait 
1919,on second thoughts  ll wait 
1920,there s plenty of time still  isn t there  and shall be able to get evie s opinion 
1921,they returned to the carriage by devious paths  when they were in  she said  but couldn t you get it renewed 
1922,beg your pardon 
1923,asked margaret 
1924,the lease  mean 
1925,oh  the lease 
1926,have you been thinking of that all the time 
1927,how very kind of you 
1928,surely something could be done 
1929,no  values have risen too enormously 
1930,they mean to pull down wickham place  and build flats like yours 
1931,but how horrible 
1932,landlords are horrible 
1933,then she said vehemently  it is monstrous  miss schlegel  it isn t right 
1934,had no idea that this was hanging over you 
1935,do pity you from the bottom of my heart 
1936,to be parted from your house  your father s house  it oughtn t to be allowed  it is worse than dying  would rather die than  oh  poor girls 
1937,can what they call civilisation be right  if people mayn t die in the room where they were born 
1938,my dear  am so sorry 
1939,margaret did not know what to say 
1940,mrs  wilcox had been overtired by the shopping  and was inclined to hysteria 
1941,howards end was nearly pulled down once 
1942,it would have killed me 
1943,i  howards end must be a very different house to ours 
1944,we are fond of ours  but there is nothing distinctive about it 
1945,as you saw  it is an ordinary london house 
1946,we shall easily find another 
1947,so you think 
1948,again my lack of experience  suppose  said margaret  easing away from the subject 
1949,can t say anything when you take up that line  mrs  wilcox 
1950,wish could see myself as you see me  foreshortened into a backfisch  quite the ingenue  very charming  wonderfully well read for my age  but incapable  
1951,mrs  wilcox would not be deterred 
1952,come down with me to howards end now  she said  more vehemently than ever 
1953,want you to see it 
1954,you have never seen it 
1955,want to hear what you say about it  for you do put things so wonderfully 
1956,margaret glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her companion 
1957,later on should love it  she continued  but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition  and we ought to start when we re fresh 
1958,isn t the house shut up  too 
1959,she received no answer 
1960,mrs  wilcox appeared to be annoyed 
1961,might come some other day 
1962,mrs  wilcox bent forward and tapped the glass 
1963,back to wickham place  please  was her order to the coachman 
1964,margaret had been snubbed 
1965,a thousand thanks  miss schlegel  for all your help 
1966,not at all 
1967,it is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind  the christmas cards especially 
1968,do admire your choice 
1969,it was her turn to receive no answer 
1970,in her turn margaret became annoyed 
1971,my husband and evie will be back the day after to morrow 
1972,that is why dragged you out shopping to day 
1973,stayed in town chiefly to shop  but got through nothing  and now he writes that they must cut their tour short  the weather is so bad  and the police traps have been so bad  nearly as bad as in surrey 
1974,ours is such a careful chauffeur  and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road hogs 
1975,why 
1976,well  naturally he  he isn t a road hog 
1977,he was exceeding the speed limit  conclude 
1978,he must expect to suffer with the lower animals 
1979,mrs  wilcox was silenced 
1980,in growing discomfort they drove homewards 
1981,the city seemed satanic  the narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine 
1982,no harm was done by the fog to trade  for it lay high  and the lighted windows of the shops were thronged with customers 
1983,it was rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself  to find a more grievous darkness within 
1984,margaret nearly spoke a dozen times  but something throttled her 
1985,she felt petty and awkward  and her meditations on christmas grew more cynical 
1986,peace 
1987,it may bring other gifts  but is there a single londoner to whom christmas is peaceful 
1988,the craving for excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing 
1989,goodwill 
1990,had she seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers 
1991,or in herself 
1992,she had failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a little queer and imaginative  she  whose birthright it was to nourish imagination 
1993,better to have accepted  to have tired themselves a little by the journey  than coldly to reply  might come some other day 
1994,her cynicism left her 
1995,there would be no other day 
1996,this shadowy woman would never ask her again 
1997,they parted at the mansions 
1998,mrs  wilcox went in after due civilities  and margaret watched the tall  lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift 
1999,as the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment the beautiful head disappeared first  still buried in the muff  the long trailing skirt followed 
2000,a woman of undefinable rarity was going up heavenward  like a specimen in a bottle 
2001,and into what a heaven  a vault as of hell  sooty black  from which soot descended 
2002,at lunch her brother  seeing her inclined for silence insisted on talking 
2003,tibby was not ill natured  but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected 
2004,now he gave her a long account of the day school that he sometimes patronised 
2005,the account was interesting  and she had often pressed him for it before  but she could not attend now  for her mind was focussed on the invisible 
2006,she discerned that mrs  wilcox  though a loving wife and mother  had only one passion in life  her house  and that the moment was solemn when she invited a friend to share this passion with her 
2007,to answer another day was to answer as a fool 
2008,another day will do for brick and mortar  but not for the holy of holies into which howards end had been transfigured 
2009,her own curiosity was slight 
2010,she had heard more than enough about it in the summer 
2011,the nine windows  the vine  and the wych elm had no pleasant connections for her  and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon at a concert 
2012,but imagination triumphed 
2013,while her brother held forth she determined to go  at whatever cost  and to compel mrs  wilcox to go  too 
2014,when lunch was over she stepped over to the flats 
2015,mrs  wilcox had just gone away for the night 
2016,margaret said that it was of no consequence  hurried downstairs  and took a hansom to king s cross 
2017,she was convinced that the escapade was important  though it would have puzzled her to say why 
2018,there was question of imprisonment and escape  and though she did not know the time of the train  she strained her eyes for st  pancras s clock 
2019,then the clock of king s cross swung into sight  a second moon in that infernal sky  and her cab drew up at the station 
2020,there was a train for hilton in five minutes 
2021,she took a ticket  asking in her agitation for a single 
2022,as she did so  a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked her 
2023,will come if still may  said margaret  laughing nervously 
2024,you are coming to sleep  dear  too 
2025,it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful 
2026,you are coming to stop 
2027,cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise 
2028,these fogs   she pointed at the station roof   never spread far 
2029,dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire  and you will never repent joining them 
2030,shall never repent joining you 
2031,it is the same 
2032,they began the walk up the long platform 
2033,far at its end stood the train  breasting the darkness without 
2034,they never reached it 
2035,before imagination could triumph  there were cries of mother  mother  and a heavy browed girl darted out of the cloak room and seized mrs  wilcox by the arm 
2036,evie  she gasped   evie  my pet  
2037,the girl called  father  say  look who s here 
2038,evie  dearest girl  why aren t you in yorkshire 
2039,no  motor smash  changed plans  father s coming 
2040,why  ruth  cried mr  wilcox  joining them  what in the name of all that s wonderful are you doing here  ruth 
2041,mrs  wilcox had recovered herself 
2042,oh  henry dear   here s a lovely surprise  but let me introduce  but think you know miss schlegel 
2043,oh yes  he replied  not greatly interested 
2044,but how s yourself  ruth 
2045,fit as a fiddle  she answered gaily 
2046,so are we  and so was our car  which ran a as far as ripon  but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver  
2047,miss schlegel  our little outing must be for another day 
2048,was saying that this fool of a driver  as the policeman himself admits 
2049,another day  mrs  wilcox 
2050,of course 
2051,  but as we ve insured against third party risks  it won t so much matter  
2052,  cart and car being practically at right angles  
2053,the voices of the happy family rose high 
2054,margaret was left alone 
2055,no one wanted her 
2056,mrs  wilcox walked out of king s cross between her husband and her daughter  listening to both of them 
2057,the funeral was over 
2058,the carriages had rolled away through the soft mud  and only the poor remained 
2059,they approached to the newly dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin  now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay 
2060,it was their moment 
2061,most of them were women from the dead woman s district  to whom black garments had been served out by mr  wilcox s orders 
2062,pure curiosity had brought others 
2063,they thrilled with the excitement of a death  and of a rapid death  and stood in groups or moved between the graves  like drops of ink 
2064,the son of one of them  a wood cutter  was perched high above their heads  pollarding one of the churchyard elms 
2065,from where he sat he could see the village of hilton  strung upon the north road  with its accreting suburbs  the sunset beyond  scarlet and orange  winking at him beneath brows of grey  the church  the plantations  and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms 
2066,but he  too  was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth 
2067,he tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching  how he could not leave his work  and yet did not like to go on with it  how he had almost slipped out of the tree  he was so upset  the rooks had cawed  and no wonder  it was as if rooks knew too  his mother claimed the prophetic power herself  she had seen a strange look about mrs  wilcox for some time 
2068,london had done the mischief  said others 
2069,she had been a kind lady  her grandmother had been kind  too  a plainer person  but very kind 
2070,ah  the old sort was dying out 
2071,mr  wilcox  he was a kind gentleman 
2072,they advanced to the topic again and again  dully  but with exaltation 
2073,the funeral of a rich person was to them what the funeral of alcestis or ophelia is to the educated 
2074,it was art  though remote from life  it enhanced life s values  and they witnessed it avidly 
2075,the grave diggers  who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval  they disliked charles  it was not a moment to speak of such things  but they did not like charles wilcox  the grave diggers finished their work and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it 
2076,the sun set over hilton  the grey brows of the evening flushed a little  and were cleft with one scarlet frown 
2077,chattering sadly to each other  the mourners passed through the lych gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village 
2078,the young wood cutter stayed a little longer  poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically 
2079,at last the bough fell beneath his saw 
2080,with a grunt  he descended  his thoughts dwelling no longer on death  but on love  for he was mating 
2081,he stopped as he passed the new grave  a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye 
2082,they didn t ought to have coloured flowers at buryings  he reflected 
2083,trudging on a few steps  he stopped again  looked furtively at the dusk  turned back  wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf  and hid it in his pocket 
2084,after him came silence absolute 
2085,the cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty  and no other house stood near 
2086,hour after hour the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it 
2087,clouds drifted over it from the west  or the church may have been a ship  high prowed  steering with all its company towards infinity 
2088,towards morning the air grew colder  the sky clearer  the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead 
2089,the wood cutter  returning after a night of joy  reflected  they lilies  they chrysants  it s a pity i didn t take them all 
2090,up at howards end they were attempting breakfast 
2091,charles and evie sat in the dining room  with mrs  charles 
2092,their father  who could not bear to see a face  breakfasted upstairs 
2093,he suffered acutely 
2094,pain came over him in spasms  as if it was physical  and even while he was about to eat  his eyes would fill with tears  and he would lay down the morsel untasted 
2095,he remembered his wife s even goodness during thirty years 
2096,not anything in detail  not courtship or early raptures  but just the unvarying virtue  that seemed to him a woman s noblest quality 
2097,so many women are capricious  breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity 
2098,not so his wife 
2099,year after year  summer and winter  as bride and mother  she had been the same  he had always trusted her 
2100,her tenderness 
2101,her innocence 
2102,the wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of god 
2103,ruth knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden  or the grass in her field 
2104,her idea of business   henry  why do people who have enough money try to get more money  her idea of politics   i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet  there would be no more wars  her idea of religion  ah  this had been a cloud  but a cloud that passed 
2105,she came of quaker stock  and he and his family  formerly dissenters  were now members of the church of england 
2106,the rector s sermons had at first repelled her  and she had expressed a desire for a more inward light  adding  not so much for myself as for baby  charles  
2107,inward light must have been granted  for he heard no complaints in later years 
2108,they brought up their three children without dispute 
2109,they had never disputed 
2110,she lay under the earth now 
2111,she had gone  and as if to make her going the more bitter  had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her 
2112,why didn t you tell me you knew of it 
2113,he had moaned  and her faint voice had answered  i didn t want to  henry  i might have been wrong  and every one hates illnesses 
2114,he had been told of the horror by a strange doctor  whom she had consulted during his absence from town 
2115,was this altogether just 
2116,without fully explaining  she had died 
2117,it was a fault on her part  and  tears rushed into his eyes  what a little fault 
2118,it was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years 
2119,he rose to his feet and looked out of the window  for evie had come in with the letters  and he could meet no one s eye 
2120,ah yes  she had been a good woman  she had been steady 
2121,he chose the word deliberately 
2122,to him steadiness included all praise 
2123,he himself  gazing at the wintry garden  is in appearance a steady man 
2124,his face was not as square as his son s  and  indeed  the chin  though firm enough in outline  retreated a little  and the lips  ambiguous  were curtained by a moustache 
2125,but there was no external hint of weakness 
2126,the eyes  if capable of kindness and good fellowship  if ruddy for the moment with tears  were the eyes of one who could not be driven 
2127,the forehead  too  was like charles s 
2128,high and straight  brown and polished  merging abruptly into temples and skull  it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world 
2129,at times it had the effect of a blank wall 
2130,he had dwelt behind it  intact and happy  for fifty years 
2131,the post s come  father  said evie awkwardly 
2132,thanks 
2133,put it down 
2134,has the breakfast been all right 
2135,yes  thanks 
2136,the girl glanced at him and at it with constraint 
2137,she did not know what to do 
2138,charles says do you want the times 
2139,no  i ll read it later 
2140,ring if you want anything  father  won t you 
2141,i ve all i want 
2142,having sorted the letters from the circulars  she went back to the dining room 
2143,father s eaten nothing  she announced  sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the tea urn 
2144,charles did not answer  but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs  opened the door  and said look here father  you must eat  you know  and having paused for a reply that did not come  stole down again 
2145,he s going to read his letters first  i think  he said evasively  i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards 
2146,then he took up the times  and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate 
2147,poor mrs  charles sat between her silent companions terrified at the course of events  and a little bored 
2148,she was a rubbishy little creature  and she knew it 
2149,a telegram had dragged her from naples to the death bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known 
2150,a word from her husband had plunged her into mourning 
2151,she desired to mourn inwardly as well  but she wished that mrs  wilcox  since fated to die  could have died before the marriage  for then less would have been expected of her 
2152,crumbling her toast  and too nervous to ask for the butter  she remained almost motionless  thankful only for this  that her father in law was having his breakfast upstairs 
2153,at last charles spoke 
2154,they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday  he said to his sister 
2155,no  indeed 
2156,i must make a note of that  he continued 
2157,i am surprised that the rector allowed it 
2158,perhaps it may not be the rector s affair 
2159,whose else could it be 
2160,the lord of the manor 
2161,impossible 
2162,butter  dolly 
2163,thank you  evie dear 
2164,charles  
2165,yes  dear 
2166,i didn t know one could pollard elms 
2167,i thought one only pollarded willows 
2168,oh no  one can pollard elms 
2169,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded 
2170,charles frowned a little  and turned again to his sister 
2171,another point 
2172,i must speak to chalkeley 
2173,yes  rather  you must complain to chalkeley 
2174,it s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men 
2175,he is responsible 
2176,yes  rather 
2177,brother and sister were not callous 
2178,they spoke thus  partly because they desired to keep chalkeley up to the mark  a healthy desire in its way  partly because they avoided the personal note in life 
2179,all wilcoxes did 
2180,it did not seem to them of supreme importance 
2181,or it may be as helen supposed  they realised its importance  but were afraid of it 
2182,panic and emptiness  could one glance behind 
2183,they were not callous  and they left the breakfast table with aching hearts 
2184,their mother never had come in to breakfast 
2185,it was in the other rooms  and especially in the garden  that they felt her loss most 
2186,as charles went out to the garage  he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could never replace 
2187,what battles he had fought against her gentle conservatism 
2188,how she had disliked improvements  yet how loyally she had accepted them when made 
2189,he and his father  what trouble they had had to get this very garage  with what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them the paddock for it  the paddock that she loved more dearly than the garden itself 
2190,the vine  she had got her way about the vine  it still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches  and so with evie  as she stood talking to the cook  though she could take up her mother s work inside the house  just as the man could take it up without  she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life  their grief  though less poignant than their father s  grew from deeper roots  for a wife may be replaced  a mother never  charles would go back to the office  there was little at howards end  the contents of his mother s will had long been known to them  there were no legacies  no annuities  none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities  trusting her husband  she had left him everything without reserve  she was quite a poor woman  the house had been all her dowry  and the house would come to charles in time 
2191,her watercolours mr  wilcox intended to reserve for paul  while evie would take the jewellery and lace 
2192,how easily she slipped out of life 
2193,charles thought the habit laudable  though he did not intend to adopt it himself  whereas margaret would have seen in it an almost culpable indifference to earthly fame 
2194,cynicism  not the superficial cynicism that snarls and sneers  but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and tenderness  that was the note of mrs  wilcox s will 
2195,she wanted not to vex people 
2196,that accomplished  the earth might freeze over her for ever 
2197,no  there was nothing for charles to wait for 
2198,he could not go on with his honeymoon  so he would go up to london and work  he felt too miserable hanging about 
2199,he and dolly would have the furnished flat while his father rested quietly in the country with evie 
2200,he could also keep an eye on his own little house  which was being painted and decorated for him in one of the surrey suburbs  and in which he hoped to install himself soon after christmas 
2201,yes  he would go up after lunch in his new motor  and the town servants  who had come down for the funeral  would go up by train 
2202,he found his father s chauffeur in the garage  said morning without looking at the man s face  and bending over the car  continued  hullo  my new car s been driven 
2203,has it  sir 
2204,yes  said charles  getting rather red  and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly  for there s mud on the axle 
2205,take it off 
2206,the man went for the cloths without a word 
2207,he was a chauffeur as ugly as sin  not that this did him disservice with charles  who thought charm in a man rather rot  and had soon got rid of the little italian beast with whom they had started 
2208,charles   his bride was tripping after him over the hoar frost  a dainty black column  her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof 
2209,one minute  i m busy 
2210,well  crane  who s been driving it  do you suppose 
2211,don t know  i m sure  sir 
2212,no one s driven it since i ve been back  but  of course  there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire 
2213,the mud came off easily 
2214,charles  your father s down 
2215,something s happened 
2216,he wants you in the house at once 
2217,oh  charles 
2218,wait  dear  wait a minute 
2219,who had the key of the garage while you were away  crane 
2220,the gardener  sir 
2221,do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor 
2222,no  sir  no one s had the motor out  sir 
2223,then how do you account for the mud on the axle 
2224,i can t  of course  say for the time i ve been in yorkshire 
2225,no more mud now  sir 
2226,charles was vexed 
2227,the man was treating him as a fool  and if his heart had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father 
2228,but it was not a morning for complaints 
2229,ordering the motor to be round after lunch  he joined his wife  who had all the while been pouring out some incoherent story about a letter and a miss schlegel 
2230,now  dolly  i can attend to you 
2231,miss schlegel 
2232,what does she want 
2233,when people wrote a letter charles always asked what they wanted 
2234,want was to him the only because of action 
2235,and the question in this case was correct  for his wife replied  she wants howards end 
2236,howards end 
2237,now  crane  just don t forget to put on the stepney wheel 
2238,no  sir 
2239,now  mind you don t forget  for i  come  little woman  when they were out of the chauffeur s sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed her against him  all his affection and half his attention  it was what he granted her throughout their happy married life 
2240,but you haven t listened  charles 
2241,what s wrong 
2242,i keep on telling you  howards end 
2243,miss schlegel s got it 
2244,got what 
2245,said charles  unclasping her 
2246,what the dickens are you talking about 
2247,now  charles  you promised not to say those naughty  
2248,look here  i m in no mood for foolery 
2249,it s no morning for it either 
2250,i tell you  i keep on telling you  miss schlegel  she s got it  your mother s left it to her  and you ve all got to move out 
2251,howards end 
2252,howards end  she screamed  mimicking him  and as she did so evie came dashing out of the shubbery 
2253,dolly  go back at once 
2254,my father s much annoyed with you 
2255,charles   she hit herself wildly   come in at once to father 
2256,he s had a letter that s too awful 
2257,charles began to run  but checked himself  and stepped heavily across the gravel path 
2258,there the house was with the nine windows  the unprolific vine 
2259,he exclaimed  schlegels again  and as if to complete chaos  dolly said  oh no  the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her 
2260,come in  all three of you  cried his father  no longer inert 
2261,dolly  why have you disobeyed me 
2262,oh  mr  wilcox  
2263,i told you not to go out to the garage 
2264,i ve heard you all shouting in the garden 
2265,i won t have it 
2266,come in 
2267,he stood in the porch  transformed  letters in his hand 
2268,into the dining room  every one of you 
2269,we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants 
2270,here  charles  here  read these 
2271,see what you make 
2272,charles took two letters  and read them as he followed the procession 
2273,the first was a covering note from the matron 
2274,mrs  wilcox had desired her  when the funeral should be over  to forward the enclosed 
2275,the enclosed  it was from his mother herself 
2276,she had written  to my husband  i should like miss schlegel  margaret  to have howards end 
2277,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this 
2278,he remarked  ominously calm 
2279,certainly 
2280,i was coming out to you when dolly  
2281,well  let s sit down 
2282,come  evie  don t waste time  sit  down 
2283,in silence they drew up to the breakfast table 
2284,the events of yesterday  indeed  of this morning suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it  heavy breathings were heard  they were calming themselves  charles  to steady them further  read the enclosure out loud  a note in my mother s handwriting  in an envelope addressed to my father  sealed  inside  i should like miss schlegel  margaret  to have howards end  no date  no signature  forwarded through the matron of that nursing home  now  the question is  
2285,dolly interrupted him 
2286,but i say that note isn t legal 
2287,houses ought to be done by a lawyer  charles  surely 
2288,her husband worked his jaw severely 
2289,little lumps appeared in front of either ear  a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect  and she asked whether she might see the note 
2290,charles looked at his father for permission  who said abstractedly  give it her 
2291,she seized it  and at once exclaimed  why  it s only in pencil 
2292,i said so 
2293,pencil never counts 
2294,we know that it is not legally binding  dolly  said mr  wilcox  speaking from out of his fortress 
2295,we are aware of that 
2296,legally  i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire 
2297,of course  my dear  we consider you as one of the family  but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand 
2298,charles  vexed both with his father and his wife  then repeated  the question is   he had cleared a space of the breakfast table from plates and knives  so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth 
2299,the question is whether miss schlegel  during the fortnight we were all away  whether she unduly   he stopped 
2300,i don t think that  said his father  whose nature was nobler than his son s 
2301,don t think what 
2302,that she would have  that it is a case of undue influence  no  to my mind the question is the  the invalid s condition at the time she wrote 
2303,my dear father  consult an expert if you like  but i don t admit it is my mother s writing 
2304,why  you just said it was  cried dolly 
2305,never mind if i did  he blazed out  and hold your tongue 
2306,the poor little wife coloured at this  and  drawing her handkerchief from her pocket  she would a few tears 
2307,no one noticed her 
2308,evie was scowling like an angry boy 
2309,the two men were gradually assuming the manner of the committee room 
2310,they were both at their best when serving on committees 
2311,they did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk  but disposed of them item by item  sharply 
2312,caligraphy was the item before them now  and on it they turned their well trained brains 
2313,charles  after a little demur  accepted the writing as genuine  and they passed on to the next point 
2314,it is the best  perhaps the only  way of dodging emotion 
2315,they were the average human article  and had they considered the note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad 
2316,considered item by item  the emotional content was minimised  and all went forward smoothly 
2317,the clock ticked  the coals blazed higher  and contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows 
2318,unnoticed  the sun occupied his sky  and the shadows of the tree stems  extraordinarily solid  fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn 
2319,it was a glorious winter morning 
2320,evie s fox terrier  who had passed for white  was only a dirty grey dog now  so intense was the purity that surrounded him 
2321,he was discredited  but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with arabian darkness  for all the conventional colouring of life had been altered 
2322,inside  the clock struck ten with a rich and confident note 
2323,other clocks confirmed it  and the discussion moved towards its close 
2324,to follow it is unnecessary 
2325,it is rather a moment when the commentator should step forward 
2326,ought the wilcoxes to have offered their home to margaret 
2327,i think not 
2328,the appeal was too flimsy 
2329,it was not legal  it had been written in illness  and under the spell of a sudden friendship  it was contrary to the dead woman s intentions in the past  contrary to her very nature  so far as that nature was understood by them 
2330,to them howards end was a house  they could not know that to her it had been a spirit  for which she sought a spiritual heir 
2331,and  pushing one step farther in these mists  may they not have decided even better than they supposed 
2332,is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be bequeathed at all 
2333,has the soul offspring 
2334,a wych elm tree  a vine  a wisp of hay with dew on it  can passion for such things be transmitted where there is no bond of blood 
2335,no  the wilcoxes are not to be blamed 
2336,the problem is too terrific  and they could not even perceive a problem 
2337,no  it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear the note up and throw it on to their dining room fire 
2338,the practical moralist may acquit them absolutely 
2339,he who strives to look deeper may acquit them  almost 
2340,for one hard fact remains 
2341,they did neglect a personal appeal 
2342,the woman who had died did say to them  do this  and they answered  we will not 
2343,the incident made a most painful impression on them 
2344,grief mounted into the brain and worked there disquietingly 
2345,yesterday they had lamented  she was a dear mother  a true wife  in our absence she neglected her health and died 
2346,to day they thought  she was not as true  as dear  as we supposed 
2347,the desire for a more inward light had found expression at last  the unseen had impacted on the seen  and all that they could say was treachery 
2348,mrs  wilcox had been treacherous to the family  to the laws of property  to her own written word 
2349,how did she expect howards end to be conveyed to miss schlegel 
2350,was her husband  to whom it legally belonged  to make it over to her as a free gift 
2351,was the said miss schlegel to have a life interest in it  or to own it absolutely 
2352,was there to be no compensation for the garage and other improvements that they had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some day 
2353,treacherous  treacherous and absurd 
2354,when we think the dead both treacherous and absurd  we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves to their departure 
2355,that note  scribbled in pencil  sent through the matron  was unbusinesslike as well as cruel  and decreased at once the value of the woman who had written it 
2356,ah  well  said mr  wilcox  rising from the table 
2357,i shouldn t have thought it possible 
2358,mother couldn t have meant it  said evie  still frowning 
2359,no  my girl  of course not 
2360,mother believed so in ancestors too  it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider  who d never appreciate 
2361,the whole thing is unlike her  he announced 
2362,if miss schlegel had been poor  if she had wanted a house  i could understand it a little 
2363,but she has a house of her own 
2364,why should she want another 
2365,she wouldn t have any use for howards end 
2366,that time may prove  murmured charles 
2367,how 
2368,asked his sister 
2369,presumably she knows  mother will have told her 
2370,she got twice or three times into the nursing home 
2371,presumably she is awaiting developments 
2372,what a horrid woman 
2373,and dolly  who had recovered  cried  why  she may be coming down to turn us out now 
2374,charles put her right 
2375,i wish she would  he said ominously 
2376,i could then deal with her 
2377,so could i  echoed his father  who was feeling rather in the cold 
2378,charles had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in telling him to eat his breakfast  but the boy as he grew up was a little dictatorial  and assumed the post of chairman too readily 
2379,i could deal with her  if she comes  but she won t come 
2380,you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel 
2381,that paul business was pretty scandalous  though 
2382,i want no more of the paul business  charles  as i said at the time  and besides  it is quite apart from this business 
2383,margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week  and we have all suffered under her  but upon my soul she s honest 
2384,she s not in collusion with the matron 
2385,i m absolutely certain of it 
2386,nor was she with the doctor  i m equally certain of that 
2387,she did not hide anything from us  for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are 
2388,she  like ourselves  was a dupe   he stopped for a moment 
2389,you see  charles  in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions 
2390,paul would not have left england  you would not have gone to italy  nor evie and i into yorkshire  if only we had known 
2391,well  miss schlegel s position has been equally false 
2392,take all in all  she has not come out of it badly 
2393,evie said  but those chrysanthemums  
2394,or coming down to the funeral at all   echoed dolly 
2395,why shouldn t she come down 
2396,she had the right to  and she stood far back among the hilton women 
2397,the flowers  certainly we should not have sent such flowers  but they may have seemed the right thing to her  evie  and for all you know they may be the custom in germany 
2398,oh  i forget she isn t really english  cried evie 
2399,that would explain a lot 
2400,she s a cosmopolitan  said charles  looking at his watch 
2401,i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans 
2402,my fault  doubtless 
2403,i cannot stand them  and a german cosmopolitan is the limit 
2404,i think that s about all  isn t it 
2405,i want to run down and see chalkeley 
2406,a bicycle will do 
2407,and  by the way  i wish you d speak to crane some time 
2408,i m certain he s had my new car out 
2409,has he done it any harm 
2410,in that case i shall let it pass 
2411,it s not worth while having a row 
2412,charles and his father sometimes disagreed 
2413,but they always parted with an increased regard for one another  and each desired no doughtier comrade when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions 
2414,so the sailors of ulysses voyaged past the sirens  having first stopped one another s ears with wool 
2415,charles need not have been anxious 
2416,miss schlegel had never heard of his mother s strange request 
2417,she was to hear of it in after years  when she had built up her life differently  and it was to fit into position as the headstone of the corner 
2418,her mind was bent on other questions now  and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an invalid 
2419,she was parting from these wilcoxes for the second time 
2420,paul and his mother  ripple and great wave  had flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever 
2421,the ripple had left no traces behind  the wave had strewn at her feet fragments torn from the unknown 
2422,a curious seeker  she stood for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little  but tells a little  and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide 
2423,her friend had vanished in agony  but not  she believed  in degradation 
2424,her withdrawal had hinted at other things besides disease and pain 
2425,some leave our life with tears  others with an insane frigidity  mrs  wilcox had taken the middle course  which only rarer natures can pursue 
2426,she had kept proportion 
2427,she had told a little of her grim secret to her friends  but not too much  she had shut up her heart  almost  but not entirely  it is thus  if there is any rule  that we ought to die  neither as victim nor as fanatic  but as the seafarer who can greet with an equal eye the deep that he is entering  and the shore that he must leave 
2428,the last word  whatever it would be  had certainly not been said in hilton churchyard 
2429,she had not died there 
2430,a funeral is not death  any more than baptism is birth or marriage union 
2431,all three are the clumsy devices  coming now too late  now too early  by which society would register the quick motions of man 
2432,in margaret s eyes mrs  wilcox had escaped registration 
2433,she had gone out of life vividly  her own way  and no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin  lowered with ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth  no flowers so utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered before morning 
2434,margaret had once said she loved superstition 
2435,it was not true 
2436,few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in which body and soul are enwrapped 
2437,the death of mrs  wilcox had helped her in her work 
2438,she saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a human being is  and to what he may aspire 
2439,truer relationships gleamed 
2440,perhaps the last word would be hope  hope even on this side of the grave 
2441,meanwhile  she could take an interest in the survivors 
2442,in spite of her christmas duties  in spite of her brother  the wilcoxes continued to play a considerable part in her thoughts 
2443,she had seen so much of them in the final week 
2444,they were not her sort  they were often suspicious and stupid  and deficient where she excelled  but collision with them stimulated her  and she felt an interest that verged into liking  even for charles 
2445,she desired to protect them  and often felt that they could protect her  excelling where she was deficient 
2446,once past the rocks of emotion  they knew so well what to do  whom to send for  their hands were on all the ropes  they had grit as well as grittiness and she valued grit enormously 
2447,they led a life that she could not attain to  the outer life of telegrams and anger  which had detonated when helen and paul had touched in june  and had detonated again the other week 
2448,to margaret this life was to remain a real force 
2449,she could not despise it  as helen and tibby affected to do 
2450,it fostered such virtues as neatness  decision  and obedience  virtues of the second rank  no doubt  but they have formed our civilisation 
2451,they form character  too  margaret could not doubt it  they keep the soul from becoming sloppy 
2452,how dare schlegels despise wilcoxes  when it takes all sorts to make a world 
2453,don t brood too much  she wrote to helen  on the superiority of the unseen to the seen 
2454,it s true  but to brood on it is medieval 
2455,our business is not to contrast the two  but to reconcile them 
2456,helen replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull subject 
2457,what did her sister take her for 
2458,the weather was magnificent 
2459,she and the mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that pomerania boasted 
2460,it was fun  but over crowded  for the rest of pomerania had gone there too 
2461,helen loved the country  and her letter glowed with physical exercise and poetry 
2462,she spoke of the scenery  quiet  yet august  of the snow clad fields  with their scampering herds of deer  of the river and its quaint entrance into the baltic sea  of the oderberge  only three hundred feet high  from which one slid all too quickly back into the pomeranian plains  and yet these oderberge were real mountains  with pine forests  streams  and views complete 
2463,it isn t size that counts so much as the way things are arranged 
2464,in another paragraph she referred to mrs  wilcox sympathetically  but the news had not bitten into her 
2465,she had not realised the accessories of death  which are in a sense more memorable than death itself 
2466,the atmosphere of precautions and recriminations  and in the midst a human body growing more vivid because it was in pain  the end of that body in hilton churchyard  the survival of something that suggested hope  vivid in its turn against life s workaday cheerfulness   all these were lost to helen  who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be pleasant no longer  she returned to wickham place full of her own affairs  she had had another proposal  and margaret  after a moment s hesitation  was content that this should be so 
2467,the proposal had not been a serious matter 
2468,it was the work of fraulein mosebach  who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning back her cousins to the fatherland by matrimony 
2469,england had played paul wilcox  and lost  germany played herr forstmeister some one  helen could not remember his name  herr forstmeister lived in a wood  and  standing on the summit of the oderberge  he had pointed out his house to helen  or rather  had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay  she had exclaimed  oh  how lovely  that s the place for me  and in the evening frieda appeared in her bedroom  i have a message  dear helen  etc   and so she had  but had been very nice when helen laughed  quite understood  a forest too solitary and damp  quite agreed  but herr forstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary 
2470,germany had lost  but with good humour  holding the manhood of the world  she felt bound to win 
2471,and there will even be some one for tibby  concluded helen 
2472,there now  tibby  think of that  frieda is saving up a little girl for you  in pig tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries 
2473,i ve talked too much 
2474,my head aches 
2475,now you talk 
2476,tibby consented to talk 
2477,he too was full of his own affairs  for he had just been up to try for a scholarship at oxford 
2478,the men were down  and the candidates had been housed in various colleges  and had dined in hall 
2479,tibby was sensitive to beauty  the experience was new  and he gave a description of his visit that was almost glowing 
2480,the august and mellow university  soaked with the richness of the western counties that it has served for a thousand years  appealed at once to the boy s taste  it was the kind of thing he could understand  and he understood it all the better because it was empty 
2481,oxford is  oxford  not a mere receptacle for youth  like cambridge 
2482,perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another  such at all events was to be its effect on tibby 
2483,his sisters sent him there that he might make friends  for they knew that his education had been cranky  and had severed him from other boys and men 
2484,he made no friends 
2485,his oxford remained oxford empty  and he took into life with him  not the memory of a radiance  but the memory of a colour scheme 
2486,it pleased margaret to hear her brother and sister talking 
2487,they did not get on overwell as a rule 
2488,for a few moments she listened to them  feeling elderly and benign 
2489,then something occurred to her  and she interrupted 
2490,helen  i told you about poor mrs  wilcox  that sad business 
2491,yes 
2492,i have had a correspondence with her son 
2493,he was winding up the estate  and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything 
2494,i thought it good of him  considering i knew her so little 
2495,i said that she had once spoken of giving me a christmas present  but we both forgot about it afterwards 
2496,i hope charles took the hint 
2497,yes  that is to say  her husband wrote later on  and thanked me for being a little kind to her  and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette  don t you think that is extraordinarily generous  it has made me like him very much  he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance  but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future  i like mr  wilcox  he is taking up his work  rubber  it is a big business  i gather he is launching out rather  charles is in it  too  charles is married  a pretty little creature  but she doesn t seem wise 
2498,they took on the flat  but now they have gone off to a house of their own 
2499,helen  after a decent pause  continued her account of stettin 
2500,how quickly a situation changes 
2501,in june she had been in a crisis  even in november she could blush and be unnatural  now it was january and the whole affair lay forgotten 
2502,looking back on the past six months  margaret realised the chaotic nature of our daily life  and its difference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by historians 
2503,actual life is full of false clues and sign posts that lead nowhere 
2504,with infinite effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never comes 
2505,the most successful career must show a waste of strength that might have removed mountains  and the most unsuccessful is not that of the man who is taken unprepared  but of him who has prepared and is never taken 
2506,on a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly silent 
2507,it assumes that preparation against danger is in itself a good  and that men  like nations  are the better for staggering through life fully armed 
2508,the tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled  save by the greeks 
2509,life is indeed dangerous  but not in the way morality would have us believe 
2510,it is indeed unmanageable  but the essence of it is not a battle 
2511,it is unmanageable because it is a romance  and its essence is romantic beauty 
2512,margaret hoped that for the future she would be less cautious  not more cautious  than she had been in the past 
2513,over two years passed  and the schlegel household continued to lead its life of cultured  but not ignoble  ease  still swimming gracefully on the grey tides of london 
2514,concerts and plays swept past them  money had been spent and renewed  reputations won and lost  and the city herself  emblematic of their lives  rose and fell in a continual flux  while her shallows washed more widely against the hills of surrey and over the fields of hertfordshire 
2515,this famous building had arisen  that was doomed 
2516,to day whitehall had been transformed  it would be the turn of regent street to morrow 
2517,and month by month the roads smelt more strongly of petrol  and were more difficult to cross  and human beings heard each other speak with greater difficulty  breathed less of the air  and saw less of the sky 
2518,nature withdrew  the leaves were falling by midsummer  the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity 
2519,to speak against london is no longer fashionable 
2520,the earth as an artistic cult has had its day  and the literature of the near future will probably ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town 
2521,one can understand the reaction 
2522,of pan and the elemental forces  the public has heard a little too much  they seem victorian  while london is georgian  and those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long ere the pendulum swings back to her again 
2523,certainly london fascinates 
2524,one visualises it as a tract of quivering grey  intelligent without purpose  and excitable without love  as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled  as a heart that certainly beats  but with no pulsation of humanity 
2525,it lies beyond everything  nature  with all her cruelty  comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men 
2526,a friend explains himself  the earth is explicable  from her we came  and we must return to her  but who can explain westminster bridge road or liverpool street in the morning  the city inhaling  or the same thoroughfares in the evening  the city exhaling her exhausted air 
2527,we reach in desperation beyond the fog  beyond the very stars  the voids of the universe are ransacked to justify the monster  and stamped with a human face 
2528,london is religion s opportunity  not the decorous religion of theologians  but anthropomorphic  crude  yes  the continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own sort  not any one pompous or tearful  were caring for us up in the sky 
2529,the londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him  too  away from his moorings  and margaret s eyes were not opened until the lease of wickham place expired 
2530,she had always known that it must expire  but the knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event 
2531,then the house was suddenly ringed with pathos 
2532,it had seen so much happiness 
2533,why had it to be swept away 
2534,in the streets of the city she noted for the first time the architecture of hurry and heard the language of hurry on the mouths of its inhabitants  clipped words  formless sentences  potted expressions of approval or disgust  month by month things were stepping livelier  but to what goal  the population still rose  but what was the quality of the men born  the particular millionaire who owned the freehold of wickham place  and desired to erect babylonian flats upon it  what right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering jelly 
2535,he was not a fool  she had heard him expose socialism  but true insight began just where his intelligence ended  and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires 
2536,what right had such men  but margaret checked herself 
2537,that way lies madness 
2538,thank goodness  she  too  had some money  and could purchase a new home 
2539,tibby  now in his second year at oxford  was down for the easter vacation  and margaret took the opportunity of having a serious talk with him 
2540,did he at all know where he wanted to live 
2541,tibby didn t know that he did know 
2542,did he at all know what he wanted to do 
2543,he was equally uncertain  but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite free of any profession 
2544,margaret was not shocked  but went on sewing for a few minutes before she replied 
2545,i was thinking of mr  vyse 
2546,he never strikes me as particularly happy 
2547,ye  es 
2548,said tibby  and then held his mouth open in a curious quiver  as if he  too  had thought of mr  vyse  had seen round  through  over  and beyond mr  vyse  had weighed mr  vyse  grouped him  and finally dismissed him as having no possible bearing on the subject under discussion 
2549,that bleat of tibby s infuriated helen 
2550,but helen was now down in the dining room preparing a speech about political economy 
2551,at times her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor 
2552,but mr  vyse is rather a wretched  weedy man  don t you think 
2553,then there s guy 
2554,that was a pitiful business 
2555,besides   shifting to the general   every one is the better for some regular work 
2556,groans 
2557,i shall stick to it  she continued  smiling 
2558,i am not saying it to educate you  it is what i really think 
2559,i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work  and they must not starve it 
2560,it s a new desire 
2561,it goes with a great deal that s bad  but in itself it s good  and i hope that for women  too  not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago 
2562,i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude  enunciated tibby 
2563,then we ll leave the subject till you do 
2564,i m not going to rattle you round 
2565,take your time 
2566,only do think over the lives of the men you like most  and see how they ve arranged them 
2567,i like guy and mr  vyse most  said tibby faintly  and leant so far back in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to throat 
2568,and don t think i m not serious because i don t use the traditional arguments  making money  a sphere awaiting you  and so on  all of which are  for various reasons  cannot 
2569,she sewed on 
2570,i m only your sister 
2571,i haven t any authority over you  and i don t want to have any 
2572,just to put before you what i think the truth 
2573,you see   she shook off the pince nez to which she had recently taken   in a few years we shall be the same age practically  and i shall want you to help me 
2574,men are so much nicer than women 
2575,labouring under such a delusion  why do you not marry 
2576,i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance 
2577,has nobody arst you 
2578,only ninnies 
2579,do people ask helen 
2580,plentifully 
2581,tell me about them 
2582,tell me about your ninnies  then 
2583,they were men who had nothing better to do  said his sister  feeling that she was entitled to score this point 
2584,so take warning  you must work  or else you must pretend to work  which is what i do 
2585,work  work  work if you d save your soul and your body 
2586,it is honestly a necessity  dear boy 
2587,look at the wilcoxes  look at mr  pembroke 
2588,with all their defects of temper and understanding  such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped  and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly 
2589,spare me the wilcoxes  he moaned 
2590,i shall not 
2591,they are the right sort 
2592,oh  goodness me  meg    he protested  suddenly sitting up  alert and angry 
2593,tibby  for all his defects  had a genuine personality 
2594,well  they re as near the right sort as you can imagine 
2595,no  no  oh  no 
2596,i was thinking of the younger son  whom i once classed as a ninny  but who came back so ill from nigeria 
2597,he s gone out there again  evie wilcox tells me  out to his duty 
2598,duty always elicited a groan 
2599,he doesn t want the money  it is work he wants  though it is beastly work  dull country  dishonest natives  an eternal fidget over fresh water and food   
2600,a nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud 
2601,no wonder england has become an empire 
2602,empire 
2603,i can t bother over results  said margaret  a little sadly 
2604,they are too difficult for me  i can only look at the men 
2605,an empire bores me  so far  but i can appreciate the heroism that builds it up 
2606,london bores me  but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make london  
2607,what it is  he sneered 
2608,what it is  worse luck 
2609,i want activity without civilisation 
2610,how paradoxical 
2611,yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven 
2612,and i  said tibby  want civilisation without activity  which  i expect  is what we shall find in the other place 
2613,you needn t go as far as the other place  tibbikins  if you want that 
2614,you can find it at oxford 
2615,stupid  
2616,if i m stupid  get me back to the house hunting 
2617,i ll even live in oxford if you like  north oxford 
2618,i ll live anywhere except bournemouth  torquay  and cheltenham 
2619,oh yes  or ilfracombe and swanage and tunbridge wells and surbiton and bedford 
2620,there on no account 
2621,london  then 
2622,i agree  but helen rather wants to get away from london 
2623,however  there s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a flat in town  provided we all stick together and contribute 
2624,though of course  oh  how one does maunder on and to think  to think of the people who are really poor 
2625,how do they live 
2626,not to move about the world would kill me 
2627,as she spoke  the door was flung open  and helen burst in in a state of extreme excitement 
2628,oh  my dears  what do you think 
2629,you ll never guess 
2630,a woman s been here asking me for her husband 
2631,her what 
2632, helen was fond of supplying her own surprise  
2633,yes  for her husband  and it really is so 
2634,not anything to do with bracknell 
2635,cried margaret  who had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots 
2636,i offered bracknell  and he was rejected 
2637,so was tibby 
2638, cheer up  tibby  
2639,it s no one we know 
2640,i said  hunt  my good woman  have a good look round  hunt under the tables  poke up the chimney  shake out the antimacassars 
2641,husband 
2642,husband 
2643,oh  and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier 
2644,now  helen  what did really happen 
2645,what i say 
2646,i was  as it were  orating my speech 
2647,annie opens the door like a fool  and shows a female straight in on me  with my mouth open 
2648,then we began  very civilly  i want my husband  what i have reason to believe is here  no  how unjust one is 
2649,she said whom  not what 
2650,she got it perfectly 
2651,so i said  name  please 
2652,and she said  lan  miss  and there we were 
2653,lan 
2654,lan or len 
2655,we were not nice about our vowels 
2656,lanoline 
2657,but what an extraordinary  
2658,i said  my good mrs  lanoline  we have some grave misunderstanding here 
2659,beautiful as i am  my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty  and never  never has mr  lanoline rested his eyes on mine 
2660,i hope you were pleased  said tibby 
2661,of course  helen squeaked 
2662,a perfectly delightful experience 
2663,oh  mrs  lanoline s a dear  she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella  she mislaid him saturday afternoon  and for a long time suffered no inconvenience 
2664,but all night  and all this morning her apprehensions grew 
2665,breakfast didn t seem the same  no  no more did lunch  and so she strolled up to wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article 
2666,but how on earth  
2667,don t begin how on earthing 
2668,i know what i know  she kept repeating  not uncivilly  but with extreme gloom 
2669,in vain i asked her what she did know 
2670,some knew what others knew  and others didn t  and then others again had better be careful 
2671,oh dear  she was incompetent 
2672,she had a face like a silkworm  and the dining room reeks of orris root 
2673,we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands  and i wondered where hers was too  and advised her to go to the police 
2674,she thanked me 
2675,we agreed that mr  lanoline s a notty  notty man  and hasn t no business to go on the lardy da 
2676,but i think she suspected me up to the last 
2677,bags i writing to aunt juley about this 
2678,now  meg  remember  bags i 
2679,bag it by all means  murmured margaret  putting down her work 
2680,i m not sure that this is so funny  helen 
2681,it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere  doesn t it 
2682,i don t think so  she doesn t really mind 
2683,the admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy 
2684,her husband may be  though  said margaret  moving to the window 
2685,oh no  not likely 
2686,no one capable of tragedy could have married mrs  lanoline 
2687,was she pretty 
2688,her figure may have been good once 
2689,the flats  their only outlook  hung like an ornate curtain between margaret and the welter of london 
2690,her thoughts turned sadly to house hunting 
2691,wickham place had been so safe 
2692,she feared  fantastically  that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor  into nearer contact with such episodes as these 
2693,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september  she said at last 
2694,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do  retorted helen  and that topic was resumed  but with acrimony 
2695,then tea came  and after tea helen went on preparing her speech  and margaret prepared one  too  for they were going out to a discussion society on the morrow 
2696,but her thoughts were poisoned 
2697,mrs  lanoline had risen out of the abyss  like a faint smell  a goblin football  telling of a life where love and hatred had both decayed 
2698,the mystery  like so many mysteries  was explained 
2699,next day  just as they were dressed to go out to dinner  a mr  bast called 
2700,he was a clerk in the employment of the porphyrion fire insurance company 
2701,thus much from his card 
2702,he had come about the lady yesterday 
2703,thus much from annie  who had shown him into the dining room 
2704,cheers  children  cried helen 
2705,it s mrs  lanoline 
2706,tibby was interested 
2707,the three hurried downstairs  to find  not the gay dog they expected  but a young man  colourless  toneless  who had already the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so common in london  and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing presences 
2708,one guessed him as the third generation  grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy whom civilisation had sucked into the town  as one of the thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach the life of the spirit 
2709,hints of robustness survived in him  more than a hint of primitive good looks  and margaret  noting the spine that might have been straight  and the chest that might have broadened  wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas 
2710,culture had worked in her own case  but during the last few weeks she had doubted whether it humanised the majority  so wide and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man  so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it 
2711,she knew this type very well  the vague aspirations  the mental dishonesty  the familiarity with the outsides of books 
2712,she knew the very tones in which he would address her 
2713,she was only unprepared for an example of her own visiting card 
2714,you wouldn t remember giving me this  miss schlegel 
2715,said he  uneasily familiar 
2716,no  i can t say i do 
2717,well  that was how it happened  you see 
2718,where did we meet  mr  bast 
2719,for the minute i don t remember 
2720,it was a concert at the queen s hall 
2721,i think you will recollect  he added pretentiously  when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven 
2722,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done  so i m not sure  do you remember  helen 
2723,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade 
2724,he thought not 
2725,then i don t remember 
2726,that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially 
2727,and you  if i may say so  took away my umbrella  inadvertently of course 
2728,likely enough  helen laughed  for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven 
2729,did you get it back 
2730,yes  thank you  miss schlegel 
2731,the mistake arose out of my card  did it 
2732,interposed margaret 
2733,yes  the mistake arose  it was a mistake 
2734,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too  and that she could find you 
2735,she continued  pushing him forward  for  though he had promised an explanation  he seemed unable to give one 
2736,that s so  calling too  a mistake 
2737,then why   
2738,began helen  but margaret laid a hand on her arm 
2739,i said to my wife  he continued more rapidly i said to mrs  bast  i have to pay a call on some friends  and mrs  bast said to me  do go 
2740,while i was gone  however  she wanted me on important business  and thought i had come here  owing to the card  and so came after me  and i beg to tender my apologies  and hers as well  for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you 
2741,no inconvenience  said helen  but i still don t understand 
2742,an air of evasion characterised mr  bast 
2743,he explained again  but was obviously lying  and helen didn t see why he should get off 
2744,she had the cruelty of youth 
2745,neglecting her sister s pressure  she said  i still don t understand 
2746,when did you say you paid this call 
2747,call 
2748,what call 
2749,said he  staring as if her question had been a foolish one  a favourite device of those in mid stream 
2750,this afternoon call 
2751,in the afternoon  of course  he replied  and looked at tibby to see how the repartee went 
2752,but tibby was unsympathetic  and said  saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon 
2753,s  saturday 
2754,really  said helen  and you were still calling on sunday  when your wife came here 
2755,a long visit 
2756,i don t call that fair  said mr  bast  going scarlet and handsome 
2757,there was fight in his eyes 
2758,i know what you mean  and it isn t so 
2759,oh  don t let us mind  said margaret  distressed again by odours from the abyss 
2760,it was something else  he asserted  his elaborate manner breaking down 
2761,i was somewhere else to what you think  so there 
2762,it was good of you to come and explain  she said 
2763,the rest is naturally no concern of ours 
2764,yes  but i want  i wanted  have you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel 
2765,margaret nodded 
2766,it s a beautiful book 
2767,i wanted to get back to the earth  don t you see  like richard does in the end 
2768,or have you ever read stevenson s prince otto 
2769,helen and tibby groaned gently 
2770,that s another beautiful book 
2771,you get back to the earth in that 
2772,i wanted   he mouthed affectedly 
2773,then through the mists of his culture came a hard fact  hard as a pebble 
2774,i walked all the saturday night  said leonard 
2775,i walked 
2776,a thrill of approval ran through the sisters 
2777,but culture closed in again 
2778,he asked whether they had ever read e  v  lucas s open road 
2779,said helen  no doubt it s another beautiful book  but i d rather hear about your road 
2780,oh  i walked 
2781,how far 
2782,i don t know  nor for how long 
2783,it got too dark to see my watch 
2784,were you walking alone  may i ask 
2785,yes  he said  straightening himself  but we d been talking it over at the office 
2786,there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things 
2787,the fellows there said one steers by the pole star  and i looked it up in the celestial atlas  but once out of doors everything gets so mixed 
2788,don t talk to me about the pole star  interrupted helen  who was becoming interested 
2789,i know its little ways 
2790,it goes round and round  and you go round after it 
2791,well  i lost it entirely 
2792,first of all the street lamps  then the trees  and towards morning it got cloudy 
2793,tibby  who preferred his comedy undiluted  slipped from the room 
2794,he knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry  and did not want to hear him trying 
2795,margaret and helen remained 
2796,their brother influenced them more than they knew  in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily 
2797,where did you start from 
2798,cried margaret 
2799,do tell us more 
2800,i took the underground to wimbledon 
2801,as i came out of the office i said to myself  i must have a walk once in a way 
2802,if i don t take this walk now  i shall never take it 
2803,i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon  and then  
2804,but not good country there  is it 
2805,it was gas lamps for hours 
2806,still  i had all the night  and being out was the great thing 
2807,i did get into woods  too  presently 
2808,yes  go on  said helen 
2809,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark 
2810,did you actually go off the roads 
2811,oh yes 
2812,i always meant to go off the roads  but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way 
2813,mr  bast  you re a born adventurer  laughed margaret 
2814,no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done 
2815,it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck 
2816,whatever did your wife say 
2817,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses  said helen 
2818,besides  they can t walk 
2819,it tires them 
2820,go on 
2821,i felt like r  l  s  you probably remember how in virginibus 
2822,yes  but the wood 
2823,this ere wood 
2824,how did you get out of it 
2825,i managed one wood  and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill 
2826,i rather fancy it was those north downs  for the road went off into grass  and i got into another wood 
2827,that was awful  with gorse bushes 
2828,i did wish i d never come  but suddenly it got light  just while i seemed going under one tree 
2829,then i found a road down to a station  and took the first train i could back to london 
2830,but was the dawn wonderful 
2831,asked helen 
2832,with unforgettable sincerity he replied  no 
2833,the word flew again like a pebble from the sling 
2834,down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or literary in his talk  down toppled tiresome r  l  s  and the love of the earth and his silk top hat 
2835,in the presence of these women leonard had arrived  and he spoke with a flow  an exultation  that he had seldom known 
2836,the dawn was only grey  it was nothing to mention 
2837,just a grey evening turned upside down 
2838,i know 
2839,  and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it  and so cold too  i m glad i did it  and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say  and besides  you can believe me or not as you choose  i was very hungry  that dinner at wimbledon  i meant it to last me all night like other dinners 
2840,i never thought that walking would make such a difference 
2841,why  when you re walking you want  as it were  a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well  and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines 
2842,lord  i did feel bad 
2843,looking back  it wasn t what you may call enjoyment 
2844,it was more a case of sticking to it 
2845,i did stick 
2846,i  i was determined  oh  hang it all  what s the good  i mean  the good of living in a room for ever 
2847,there one goes on day after day  same old game  same up and down to town  until you forget there is any other game 
2848,you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside  if it s only nothing particular after all 
2849,i should just think you ought  said helen  sitting on the edge of the table 
2850,the sound of a lady s voice recalled him from sincerity  and he said  curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies 
2851,excuse me  mr  bast  but you re wrong there 
2852,it didn t 
2853,it came from something far greater 
2854,but she could not stop him 
2855,borrow was imminent after jefferies  borrow  thoreau  and sorrow 
2856,r  l  s  brought up the rear  and the outburst ended in a swamp of books 
2857,no disrespect to these great names 
2858,the fault is ours  not theirs 
2859,they mean us to use them for sign posts  and are not to blame if  in our weakness  we mistake the sign post for the destination 
2860,and leonard had reached the destination 
2861,he had visited the county of surrey when darkness covered its amenities  and its cosy villas had re entered ancient night 
2862,every twelve hours this miracle happens  but he had troubled to go and see for himself 
2863,within his cramped little mind dwelt something that was greater than jefferies books  the spirit that led jefferies to write them  and his dawn  though revealing nothing but monotones  was part of the eternal sunrise that shows george borrow stonehenge 
2864,then you don t think i was foolish 
2865,he asked becoming again the naive and sweet tempered boy for whom nature intended him 
2866,heavens  no  replied margaret 
2867,heaven help us if we do  replied helen 
2868,i m very glad you say that 
2869,now  my wife would never understand  not if i explained for days 
2870,no  it wasn t foolish  cried helen  her eyes aflame 
2871,you ve pushed back the boundaries  i think it splendid of you 
2872,you ve not been content to dream as we have  
2873,though we have walked  too  
2874,i must show you a picture upstairs  
2875,here the door bell rang 
2876,the hansom had come to take them to their evening party 
2877,oh  bother  not to say dash  i had forgotten we were dining out  but do  do  come round again and have a talk  yes  you must  do  echoed margaret 
2878,leonard  with extreme sentiment  replied  no  i shall not 
2879,it s better like this 
2880,why better 
2881,asked margaret 
2882,no  it is better not to risk a second interview 
2883,i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life 
2884,really 
2885,i mean this 
2886,we can never repeat 
2887,it has done me real good  and there we had better leave it 
2888,that s rather a sad view of life  surely 
2889,things so often get spoiled 
2890,i know  flashed helen  but people don t 
2891,he could not understand this 
2892,he continued in a vein which mingled true imagination and false 
2893,what he said wasn t wrong  but it wasn t right  and a false note jarred 
2894,one little twist  they felt  and the instrument might be in tune 
2895,one little strain  and it might be silent for ever 
2896,he thanked the ladies very much  but he would not call again 
2897,there was a moment s awkwardness  and then helen said  go  then  perhaps you know best  but never forget you re better than jefferies 
2898,and he went 
2899,their hansom caught him up at the corner  passed with a waving of hands  and vanished with its accomplished load into the evening 
2900,london was beginning to illuminate herself against the night 
2901,electric lights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares  gas lamps in the side streets glimmered a canary gold or green 
2902,the sky was a crimson battlefield of spring  but london was not afraid 
2903,her smoke mitigated the splendour  and the clouds down oxford street were a delicately painted ceiling  which adorned while it did not distract 
2904,she had never known the clear cut armies of the purer air 
2905,leonard hurried through her tinted wonders  very much part of the picture 
2906,his was a grey life  and to brighten it he had ruled off a few corners for romance 
2907,the miss schlegels  or  to speak more accurately  his interview with them  were to fill such a corner  nor was it by any means the first time that he had talked intimately to strangers 
2908,the habit was analogous to a debauch  an outlet  though the worst of outlets  for instincts that would not be denied 
2909,terrifying him  it would beat down his suspicions and prudence until he was confiding secrets to people whom he had scarcely seen 
2910,it brought him many fears and some pleasant memories 
2911,perhaps the keenest happiness he had ever known was during a railway journey to cambridge  where a decent mannered undergraduate had spoken to him 
2912,they had got into conversation  and gradually leonard flung reticence aside  told some of his domestic troubles and hinted at the rest 
2913,the undergraduate  supposing they could start a friendship  asked him to coffee after hall  which he accepted  but afterwards grew shy  and took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he lodged 
2914,he did not want romance to collide with the porphyrion  still less with jacky  and people with fuller  happier lives are slow to understand this 
2915,to the schlegels  as to the undergraduate  he was an interesting creature  of whom they wanted to see more 
2916,but they to him were denizens of romance  who must keep to the corner he had assigned them  pictures that must not walk out of their frames 
2917,his behaviour over margaret s visiting card had been typical 
2918,his had scarcely been a tragic marriage 
2919,where there is no money and no inclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated 
2920,he could not leave his wife  and he did not want to hit her 
2921,petulance and squalor were enough 
2922,here that card had come in 
2923,leonard  though furtive  was untidy  and left it lying about 
2924,jacky found it  and then began  what s that card  eh 
2925,yes  don t you wish you knew what that card was 
2926,len  who s miss schlegel 
2927,etc 
2928,months passed  and the card  now as a joke  now as a grievance  was handed about  getting dirtier and dirtier 
2929,it followed them when they moved from camelia road to tulse hill 
2930,it was submitted to third parties 
2931,a few inches of pasteboard  it became the battlefield on which the souls of leonard and his wife contended 
2932,why did he not say  a lady took my umbrella  another gave me this that i might call for my umbrella  
2933,because jacky would have disbelieved him 
2934,partly  but chiefly because he was sentimental 
2935,no affection gathered round the card  but it symbolised the life of culture  that jacky should never spoil 
2936,at night he would say to himself  well  at all events  she doesn t know about that card 
2937,yah  done her there 
2938,poor jacky  she was not a bad sort  and had a great deal to bear 
2939,she drew her own conclusion  she was only capable of drawing one conclusion  and in the fulness of time she acted upon it 
2940,all the friday leonard had refused to speak to her  and had spent the evening observing the stars 
2941,on the saturday he went up  as usual  to town  but he came not back saturday night  nor sunday morning  nor sunday afternoon 
2942,the inconvenience grew intolerable  and though she was now of a retiring habit  and shy of women  she went up to wickham place 
2943,leonard returned in her absence 
2944,the card  the fatal card  was gone from the pages of ruskin  and he guessed what had happened 
2945,well 
2946,he had exclaimed  greeting her with peals of laughter 
2947,i know where you ve been  but you don t know where i ve been 
2948,jacky sighed  said  len  i do think you might explain  and resumed domesticity 
2949,explanations were difficult at this stage  and leonard was too silly  or it is tempting to write  too sound a chap to attempt them 
2950,his reticence was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes  the reticence that pretends that nothing is something  and hides behind the daily telegraph 
2951,the adventurer  also  is reticent  and it is an adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness 
2952,you may laugh at him  you who have slept nights out on the veldt  with your rifle beside you and all the atmosphere of adventure pat 
2953,and you also may laugh who think adventures silly 
2954,but do not be surprised if leonard is shy whenever he meets you  and if the schlegels rather than jacky hear about the dawn 
2955,that the schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent joy 
2956,he was at his best when he thought of them 
2957,it buoyed him as he journeyed home beneath fading heavens 
2958,somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen  and there had been  he could not phrase it  a general assertion of the wonder of the world 
2959,my conviction  says the mystic  gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it  and they had agreed that there was something beyond life s daily grey 
2960,he took off his top hat and smoothed it thoughtfully 
2961,he had hitherto supposed the unknown to be books  literature  clever conversation  culture 
2962,one raised oneself by study  and got upsides with the world 
2963,but in that quick interchange a new light dawned 
2964,was that something walking in the dark among the suburban hills 
2965,he discovered that he was going bareheaded down regent street 
2966,london came back with a rush 
2967,few were about at this hour  but all whom he passed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive because it was unconscious 
2968,he put his hat on 
2969,it was too big  his head disappeared like a pudding into a basin  the ears bending outwards at the touch of the curly brim 
2970,he wore it a little backwards  and its effect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the moustache 
2971,thus equipped  he escaped criticism 
2972,no one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements  the heart of a man ticking fast in his chest 
2973,the sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure  and when they were both full of the same subject  there were few dinner parties that could stand up against them 
2974,this particular one  which was all ladies  had more kick in it than most  but succumbed after a struggle 
2975,helen at one part of the table  margaret at the other  would talk of mr  bast and of no one else  and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided  fell ruining  and became common property 
2976,nor was this all 
2977,the dinner party was really an informal discussion club  there was a paper after it  read amid coffee cups and laughter in the drawing room  but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest 
2978,after the paper came a debate  and in this debate mr  bast also figured  appearing now as a bright spot in civilisation  now as a dark spot  according to the temperament of the speaker 
2979,the subject of the paper had been  how ought i to dispose of my money 
2980,the reader professing to be a millionaire on the point of death  inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries  but open to conviction from other sources 
2981,the various parts had been assigned beforehand  and some of the speeches were amusing 
2982,the hostess assumed the ungrateful role of the millionaire s eldest son  and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate society by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family 
2983,money was the fruit of self denial  and the second generation had a right to profit by the self denial of the first 
2984,what right had mr  bast to profit 
2985,the national gallery was good enough for the likes of him 
2986,after property had had its say  a saying that is necessarily ungracious  the various philanthropists stepped forward 
2987,something must be done for mr  bast   his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence  he must have a free library  or free tennis courts  his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was being paid  it must be made worth his while to join the territorials  he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife  the money going to her as compensation  he must be assigned a twin star  some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him ceaselessly  groans from helen   he must be given food but no clothes  clothes but no food  a third return ticket to venice  without either food or clothes when he arrived there 
2988,in short  he might be given anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself 
2989,and here margaret interrupted 
2990,order  order  miss schlegel  said the reader of the paper 
2991,you are here  i understand  to advise me in the interests of the society for the preservation of places of historic interest or natural beauty 
2992,i cannot have you speaking out of your role 
2993,it makes my poor head go round  and i think you forget that i am very ill 
2994,your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument  said margaret 
2995,why not give him the money itself 
2996,you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year 
2997,have i 
2998,i thought i had a million 
2999,wasn t a million your capital 
3000,dear me  we ought to have settled that 
3001,still  it doesn t matter 
3002,whatever you ve got  i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each 
3003,but that would be pauperising them  said an earnest girl  who liked the schlegels  but thought them a little unspiritual at times 
3004,not if you gave them so much 
3005,a big windfall would not pauperise a man 
3006,it is these little driblets  distributed among too many  that do the harm 
3007,money s educational 
3008,it s far more educational than the things it buys 
3009,there was a protest 
3010,in a sense  added margaret  but the protest continued 
3011,well  isn t the most civilized thing going  the man who has learnt to wear his income properly 
3012,exactly what your mr  basts won t do 
3013,give them a chance 
3014,give them money 
3015,don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies 
3016,give them the wherewithal to buy these things 
3017,when your socialism comes it may be different  and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash 
3018,till it comes give people cash  for it is the warp of civilisation  whatever the woof may be 
3019,the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly  for it s the  the second most important thing in the world  it is so slurred over and hushed up  there is so little clear thinking  oh  political economy  of course  but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes  and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means 
3020,money  give mr  bast money  and don t bother about his ideals 
3021,he ll pick up those for himself 
3022,she leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to misconstrue her 
3023,the female mind  though cruelly practical in daily life  cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation  and miss schlegel was asked however she could say such dreadful things  and what it would profit mr  bast if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul 
3024,she answered  nothing  but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world 
3025,then they said  no  we do not believe it  and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense  where the effort will be taken for the deed  but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this world  will ever know the rarer joys of the body  or attain to clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows 
3026,others had attacked the fabric of society  property  interest  etc 
3027,  she only fixed her eyes on a few human beings  to see how  under present conditions  they could be made happier 
3028,doing good to humanity was useless  the many coloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an universal grey 
3029,to do good to one  or  as in this case  to a few  was the utmost she dare hope for 
3030,between the idealists  and the political economists  margaret had a bad time 
3031,disagreeing elsewhere  they agreed in disowning her  and in keeping the administration of the millionaire s money in their own hands 
3032,the earnest girl brought forward a scheme of personal supervision and mutual help  the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor 
3033,the hostess pertinently remarked that she  as eldest son  might surely rank among the millionaire s legatees 
3034,margaret weakly admitted the claim  and another claim was at once set up by helen  who declared that she had been the millionaire s housemaid for over forty years  overfed and underpaid  was nothing to be done for her  so corpulent and poor 
3035,the millionaire then read out her last will and testament  in which she left the whole of her fortune to the chancellor of the exchequer 
3036,then she died 
3037,the serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the playful  in a men s debate is the reverse more general   but the meeting broke up hilariously enough  and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes 
3038,helen and margaret walked with the earnest girl as far as battersea bridge station  arguing copiously all the way 
3039,when she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation  and of the great beauty of the evening 
3040,they turned back towards oakley street 
3041,the lamps and the plane trees  following the line of the embankment  struck a note of dignity that is rare in english cities 
3042,the seats  almost deserted  were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress  who had strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide 
3043,there is something continental about chelsea embankment 
3044,it is an open space used rightly  a blessing more frequent in germany than here 
3045,as margaret and helen sat down  the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre  an opera house in which some endless trilogy was performing  and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers  who did not mind losing a little of the second act 
3046,cold 
3047,tired 
3048,doesn t matter 
3049,the earnest girl s train rumbled away over the bridge 
3050,i say  helen  
3051,well 
3052,are we really going to follow up mr  bast 
3053,i don t know 
3054,i think we won t 
3055,as you like 
3056,it s no good  i think  unless you really mean to know people 
3057,the discussion brought that home to me 
3058,we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement  but think of rational intercourse 
3059,we mustn t play at friendship 
3060,no  it s no good 
3061,there s mrs  lanoline  too  helen yawned 
3062,so dull 
3063,just so  and possibly worse than dull 
3064,i should like to know how he got hold of your card 
3065,but he said  something about a concert and an umbrella 
3066,then did the card see the wife  
3067,helen  come to bed 
3068,no  just a little longer  it is so beautiful 
3069,tell me  oh yes  did you say money is the warp of the world 
3070,yes 
3071,then what s the woof 
3072,very much what one chooses  said margaret 
3073,it s something that isn t money  one can t say more 
3074,walking at night 
3075,probably 
3076,for tibby  oxford 
3077,it seems so 
3078,for you 
3079,now that we have to leave wickham place  i begin to think it s that 
3080,for mrs  wilcox it was certainly howards end 
3081,one s own name will carry immense distances 
3082,mr  wilcox  who was sitting with friends many seats away  heard this  rose to his feet  and strolled along towards the speakers 
3083,it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people  continued margaret 
3084,why  meg 
3085,they re so much nicer generally 
3086,i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it 
3087,i believe we shall come to care about people less and less  helen 
3088,the more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them 
3089,it s one of the curses of london 
3090,i quite expect to end my life caring most for a place 
3091,here mr  wilcox reached them 
3092,it was several weeks since they had met 
3093,how do you do 
3094,he cried 
3095,i thought i recognised your voices 
3096,whatever are you both doing down here 
3097,his tones were protective 
3098,he implied that one ought not to sit out on chelsea embankment without a male escort 
3099,helen resented this  but margaret accepted it as part of the good man s equipment 
3100,what an age it is since i ve seen you  mr  wilcox 
3101,i met evie in the tube  though  lately 
3102,i hope you have good news of your son 
3103,paul 
3104,said mr  wilcox  extinguishing his cigarette  and sitting down between them 
3105,oh  paul s all right 
3106,we had a line from madeira 
3107,he ll be at work again by now 
3108,ugh   said helen  shuddering from complex causes 
3109,i beg your pardon 
3110,isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible 
3111,some one s got to go  he said simply 
3112,england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices 
3113,unless we get firm in west africa  ger  untold complications may follow 
3114,now tell me all your news 
3115,oh  we ve had a splendid evening  cried helen  who always woke up at the advent of a visitor 
3116,we belong to a kind of club that reads papers  margaret and i  all women  but there is a discussion after  this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money  whether to one s family  or to the poor  and if so how  oh  most interesting 
3117,the man of business smiled 
3118,since his wife s death he had almost doubled his income 
3119,he was an important figure at last  a reassuring name on company prospectuses  and life had treated him very well 
3120,the world seemed in his grasp as he listened to the river thames  which still flowed inland from the sea 
3121,so wonderful to the girls  it held no mysteries for him 
3122,he had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at teddington  and if he and other capitalists thought good  some day it could be shortened again 
3123,with a good dinner inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank  he felt that his hands were on all the ropes of life  and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing 
3124,sounds a most original entertainment  he exclaimed  and laughed in his pleasant way 
3125,i wish evie would go to that sort of thing 
3126,but she hasn t the time 
3127,she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers  jolly little dogs 
3128,i expect we d better be doing the same  really 
3129,we pretend we re improving ourselves  you see  said helen a little sharply  for the wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns  and she had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made would have impressed her favourably 
3130,we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate  but  as my sister says  it may be better to breed dogs 
3131,not at all 
3132,i don t agree with your sister 
3133,there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness 
3134,i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster 
3135,it would have helped me no end 
3136,quickness   
3137,yes 
3138,quickness in argument 
3139,time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t 
3140,oh  i believe in these discussions 
3141,the patronising tone  thought margaret  came well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father 
3142,she had always maintained that mr  wilcox had a charm 
3143,in times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her  but it was pleasant to listen to him now  and to watch his thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars 
3144,but helen was nettled 
3145,the aim of their debates she implied was truth 
3146,oh yes  it doesn t much matter what subject you take  said he 
3147,margaret laughed and said  but this is going to be far better than the debate itself 
3148,helen recovered herself and laughed too 
3149,no  i won t go on  she declared 
3150,i ll just put our special case to mr  wilcox 
3151,about mr  bast 
3152,yes  do 
3153,he ll be more lenient to a special case 
3154,but  mr  wilcox  do first light another cigarette 
3155,it s this 
3156,we ve just come across a young fellow  who s evidently very poor  and who seems interest  
3157,what s his profession 
3158,clerk 
3159,what in 
3160,do you remember  margaret 
3161,porphyrion fire insurance company 
3162,oh yes  the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug 
3163,he seems interesting  in some ways very  and one wishes one could help him 
3164,he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much 
3165,he likes books  and what one may roughly call adventure  and if he had a chance  but he is so poor 
3166,he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes 
3167,one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink 
3168,well  he got mixed up in our debate 
3169,he wasn t the subject of it  but it seemed to bear on his point 
3170,suppose a millionaire died  and desired to leave money to help such a man 
3171,how should he be helped 
3172,should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct  which was margaret s plan 
3173,most of them thought this would pauperise him 
3174,should he and those like him be given free libraries 
3175,i said no 
3176,he doesn t want more books to read  but to read books rightly 
3177,my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday  but then there is his wife  and they said she would have to go too 
3178,nothing seemed quite right 
3179,now what do you think 
3180,imagine that you were a millionaire  and wanted to help the poor 
3181,what would you do 
3182,mr  wilcox  whose fortune was not so very far below the standard indicated  laughed exuberantly 
3183,my dear miss schlegel  i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread 
3184,i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested 
3185,my only contribution is this  let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed 
3186,why 
3187,said margaret 
3188,he lowered his voice 
3189,this is between friends 
3190,it ll be in the receiver s hands before christmas 
3191,it ll smash  he added  thinking that she had not understood 
3192,dear me  helen  listen to that 
3193,and he ll have to get another place 
3194,will have 
3195,let him leave the ship before it sinks 
3196,let him get one now 
3197,rather than wait  to make sure 
3198,decidedly 
3199,why s that 
3200,again the olympian laugh  and the lowered voice 
3201,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance  is in a stronger position  that the man who isn t 
3202,it looks as if he s worth something 
3203,i know by myself   this is letting you into the state secrets   it affects an employer greatly 
3204,human nature  i m afraid 
3205,i hadn t thought of that  murmured margaret  while helen said  our human nature appears to be the other way round 
3206,we employ people because they re unemployed 
3207,the boot man  for instance 
3208,and how does he clean the boots 
3209,not well  confessed margaret 
3210,there you are 
3211,then do you really advise us to tell this youth   
3212,i advise nothing  he interrupted  glancing up and down the embankment  in case his indiscretion had been overheard 
3213,i oughtn t to have spoken  but i happen to know  being more or less behind the scenes  the porphyrion s a bad  bad concern  now  don t say i said so 
3214,it s outside the tariff ring 
3215,certainly i won t say 
3216,in fact  i don t know what that means 
3217,i thought an insurance company never smashed  was helen s contribution 
3218,don t the others always run in and save them 
3219,you re thinking of reinsurance  said mr  wilcox mildly 
3220,it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak 
3221,it has tried to undercut  has been badly hit by a long series of small fires  and it hasn t been able to reinsure 
3222,i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love 
3223,human nature  i suppose  quoted helen  and he laughed and agreed that it was 
3224,when margaret said that she supposed that clerks  like every one else  found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days  he replied  yes  extremely  and rose to rejoin his friends 
3225,he knew by his own office  seldom a vacant post  and hundreds of applicants for it  at present no vacant post 
3226,and how s howards end looking 
3227,said margaret  wishing to change the subject before they parted 
3228,mr  wilcox was a little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him 
3229,it s let 
3230,really 
3231,and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea 
3232,how strange are the ways of fate 
3233,no  it s let unfurnished 
3234,we ve moved 
3235,why  i thought of you both as anchored there for ever 
3236,evie never told me 
3237,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled 
3238,we only moved a week ago 
3239,paul has rather a feeling for the old place  and we held on for him to have his holiday there  but  really  it is impossibly small 
3240,endless drawbacks 
3241,i forget whether you ve been up to it 
3242,as far as the house  never 
3243,well  howards end is one of those converted farms 
3244,they don t really do  spend what you will on them 
3245,we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots  and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery 
3246,evie got rather keen on alpine plants 
3247,but it didn t do  no  it didn t do 
3248,you remember  your sister will remember  the farm with those abominable guinea fowls  and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly  so that it all went thin at the bottom 
3249,and  inside the house  the beams  and the staircase through a door  picturesque enough  but not a place to live in 
3250,he glanced over the parapet cheerfully 
3251,full tide 
3252,and the position wasn t right either 
3253,the neighbourhood s getting suburban 
3254,either be in london or out of it  i say  so we ve taken a house in ducie street  close to sloane street  and a place right down in shropshire  oniton grange  ever heard of oniton  do come and see us  right away from everywhere  up towards wales 
3255,what a change  said margaret 
3256,but the change was in her own voice  which had become most sad 
3257,i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you 
3258,hilton isn t without us  he replied 
3259,charles is there still 
3260,still 
3261,said margaret  who had not kept up with the charles s 
3262,but i thought he was still at epsom 
3263,they were furnishing that christmas  one christmas 
3264,how everything alters 
3265,i used to admire mrs  charles from our windows very often 
3266,wasn t it epsom 
3267,yes  but they moved eighteen months ago 
3268,charles  the good chap   his voice dropped   thought i should be lonely 
3269,i didn t want him to move  but he would  and took a house at the other end of hilton  down by the six hills 
3270,he had a motor  too 
3271,there they all are  a very jolly party  he and she and the two grandchildren 
3272,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves  said margaret as they shook hands 
3273,when you moved out of howards end  i should have moved mr  charles wilcox into it 
3274,i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family 
3275,so it is  he replied 
3276,i haven t sold it  and don t mean to 
3277,no  but none of you are there 
3278,oh  we ve got a splendid tenant  hamar bryce  an invalid  if charles ever wanted it  but he won t 
3279,dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences 
3280,no  we have all decided against howards end 
3281,we like it in a way  but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other 
3282,one must have one thing or the other 
3283,and some people are lucky enough to have both 
3284,you re doing yourself proud  mr  wilcox 
3285,my congratulations 
3286,and mine  said helen 
3287,do remind evie to come and see us   wickham place 
3288,we shan t be there very long  either 
3289,you  too  on the move 
3290,next september  margaret sighed 
3291,every one moving 
3292,good bye 
3293,the tide had begun to ebb 
3294,margaret leant over the parapet and watched it sadly 
3295,mr  wilcox had forgotten his wife  helen her lover  she herself was probably forgetting 
3296,every one moving 
3297,is it worth while attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men 
3298,helen roused her by saying  what a prosperous vulgarian mr  wilcox has grown 
3299,i have very little use for him in these days 
3300,however  he did tell us about the porphyrion 
3301,let us write to mr  bast as soon as ever we get home  and tell him to clear out of it at once 
3302,do  yes  that s worth doing 
3303,let us 
3304,leonard accepted the invitation to tea next saturday 
3305,but he was right  the visit proved a conspicuous failure 
3306,sugar 
3307,said margaret 
3308,cake 
3309,said helen 
3310,the big cake or the little deadlies 
3311,i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd  but we ll explain  we aren t odd  really  nor affected  really 
3312,we re over expressive  that s all 
3313,as a lady s lap dog leonard did not excel 
3314,he was not an italian  still less a frenchman  in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious repartee 
3315,his wit was the cockney s  it opened no doors into imagination  and helen was drawn up short by the more a lady has to say  the better  administered waggishly 
3316,oh yes  she said 
3317,ladies brighten  
3318,yes  i know 
3319,the darlings are regular sunbeams 
3320,let me give you a plate 
3321,how do you like your work 
3322,interposed margaret 
3323,he  too  was drawn up short 
3324,he would not have these women prying into his work 
3325,they were romance  and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated  with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls  and so were the very tea cups  with their delicate borders of wild strawberries 
3326,but he would not let romance interfere with his life 
3327,there is the devil to pay then 
3328,oh  well enough  he answered 
3329,your company is the porphyrion  isn t it 
3330,yes  that s so 
3331,  becoming rather offended 
3332,it s funny how things get round 
3333,why funny 
3334,asked helen  who did not follow the workings of his mind 
3335,it was written as large as life on your card  and considering we wrote to you there  and that you replied on the stamped paper  
3336,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies 
3337,pursued margaret 
3338,it depends on what you call big 
3339,i mean by big  a solid  well established concern  that offers a reasonably good career to its employes 
3340,i couldn t say  some would tell you one thing and others another  said the employee uneasily  for my own part   he shook his head   i only believe half i hear 
3341,not that even  it s safer 
3342,those clever ones come to the worse grief  i ve often noticed 
3343,ah  you can t be too careful 
3344,he drank  and wiped his moustache  which was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into tea cups  more bother than they re worth  surely  and not fashionable either 
3345,i quite agree  and that s why i was curious to know  is it a solid  well established concern 
3346,leonard had no idea 
3347,he understood his own corner of the machine  but nothing beyond it 
3348,he desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance  and under these circumstances  another motion of the head seemed safest 
3349,to him  as to the british public  the porphyrion was the porphyrion of the advertisement  a giant  in the classical style  but draped sufficiently  who held in one hand a burning torch  and pointed with the other to st  paul s and windsor castle 
3350,a large sum of money was inscribed below  and you drew your own conclusions 
3351,this giant caused leonard to do arithmetic and write letters  to explain the regulations to new clients  and re explain them to old ones 
3352,a giant was of an impulsive morality  one knew that much  he would pay for mrs  munt s hearthrug with ostentatious haste  a large claim he would repudiate quietly  and fight court by court  but his true fighting weight  his antecedents  his amours with other members of the commercial pantheon  all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of zeus 
3353,while the gods are powerful  we learn little about them 
3354,it is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven 
3355,we were told the porphyrion s no go  blurted helen 
3356,we wanted to tell you  that s why we wrote 
3357,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured  said margaret 
3358,now leonard had his clue 
3359,he must praise the porphyrion 
3360,you can tell your friend  he said  that he s quite wrong 
3361,oh  good 
3362,the young man coloured a little 
3363,in his circle to be wrong was fatal 
3364,the miss schlegels did not mind being wrong 
3365,they were genuinely glad that they had been misinformed 
3366,to them nothing was fatal but evil 
3367,wrong  so to speak  he added 
3368,how so to speak  
3369,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether 
3370,but this was a blunder 
3371,then he is right partly  said the elder woman  quick as lightning 
3372,leonard replied that every one was right partly  if it came to that 
3373,mr  bast  i don t understand business  and i dare say my questions are stupid  but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong  
3374,leonard sat back with a sigh 
3375,our friend  who is also a business man  was so positive 
3376,he said before christmas  
3377,and advised you to clear out of it  concluded helen 
3378,but i don t see why he should know better than you do 
3379,leonard rubbed his hands 
3380,he was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all 
3381,but a commercial training was too strong for him 
3382,nor could he say it was a bad thing  for this would be giving it away  nor yet that it was good  for this would be giving it away equally 
3383,he attempted to suggest that it was something between the two  with vast possibilities in either direction  but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes 
3384,and yet he scarcely distinguished between the two sisters 
3385,one was more beautiful and more lively  but the miss schlegels still remained a composite indian god  whose waving arms and contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind 
3386,one can but see  he remarked  adding  as ibsen says  things happen 
3387,he was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour 
3388,minute after minute slipped away  while the ladies  with imperfect skill  discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend 
3389,leonard grew annoyed  perhaps rightly 
3390,he made vague remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by others  but they did not take the hint 
3391,men might have shown more tact 
3392,women  however tactful elsewhere  are heavy handed here 
3393,they cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects in a veil 
3394,how much exactly have you  and how much do you expect to have next june 
3395,and these were women with a theory  who held that reticence about money matters is absurd  and that life would be truer if each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he stands  the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is not money 
3396,how can we do justice to the pattern otherwise 
3397,and the precious minutes slipped away  and jacky and squalor came nearer 
3398,at last he could bear it no longer  and broke in  reciting the names of books feverishly 
3399,there was a moment of piercing joy when margaret said  so you like carlyle and then the door opened  and mr  wilcox  miss wilcox entered  preceded by two prancing puppies 
3400,oh  the dears 
3401,oh  evie  how too impossibly sweet  screamed helen  falling on her hands and knees 
3402,we brought the little fellows round  said mr  wilcox 
3403,i bred them myself 
3404,oh  really 
3405,mr  bast  come and play with puppies 
3406,i ve got to be going now  said leonard sourly 
3407,but play with puppies a little first 
3408,this is ahab  that s jezebel  said evie  who was one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of old testament history 
3409,i ve got to be going 
3410,helen was too much occupied with puppies to notice him 
3411,mr  wilcox  mr  ba  must you be really 
3412,good bye 
3413,come again  said helen from the floor 
3414,then leonard s gorge arose 
3415,why should he come again 
3416,what was the good of it 
3417,he said roundly  no  i shan t  i knew it would be a failure 
3418,most people would have let him go 
3419,a little mistake 
3420,we tried knowing another class  impossible 
3421,but the schlegels had never played with life 
3422,they had attempted friendship  and they would take the consequences 
3423,helen retorted  i call that a very rude remark 
3424,what do you want to turn on me like that for 
3425,and suddenly the drawing room re echoed to a vulgar row 
3426,you ask me why i turn on you 
3427,yes 
3428,what do you want to have me here for 
3429,to help you  you silly boy  cried helen 
3430,and don t shout 
3431,i don t want your patronage 
3432,i don t want your tea 
3433,i was quite happy 
3434,what do you want to unsettle me for 
3435,he turned to mr  wilcox 
3436,i put it to this gentleman 
3437,i ask you  sir  am i to have my brain picked 
3438,mr  wilcox turned to margaret with the air of humorous strength that he could so well command 
3439,are we intruding  miss schlegel 
3440,can we be of any use  or shall we go 
3441,but margaret ignored him 
3442,i m connected with a leading insurance company  sir 
3443,i receive what i take to be an invitation from these  ladies  he drawled the word  
3444,i come  and it s to have my brain picked 
3445,i ask you  is it fair 
3446,highly unfair  said mr  wilcox  drawing a gasp from evie  who knew that her father was becoming dangerous 
3447,there  you hear that 
3448,most unfair  the gentleman says 
3449,there 
3450,not content with   pointing at margaret   you can t deny it 
3451,his voice rose  he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with jacky 
3452,but as soon as i m useful it s a very different thing 
3453,oh yes  send for him 
3454,cross question him 
3455,pick his brains 
3456,oh yes 
3457,now  take me on the whole  i m a quiet fellow  i m law abiding  i don t wish any unpleasantness  but i  i  
3458,you  said margaret   you  you  
3459,laughter from evie as at a repartee 
3460,you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star 
3461,more laughter 
3462,you saw the sunrise 
3463,laughter 
3464,you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all  away past books and houses to the truth 
3465,you were looking for a real home 
3466,i fail to see the connection  said leonard  hot with stupid anger 
3467,so do i 
3468,there was a pause 
3469,you were that last sunday  you are this to day 
3470,mr  bast 
3471,i and my sister have talked you over 
3472,we wanted to help you  we also supposed you might help us 
3473,we did not have you here out of charity  which bores us  but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days 
3474,what is the good of your stars and trees  your sunrise and the wind  if they do not enter into our daily lives 
3475,they have never entered into mine  but into yours  we thought  haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness  against pettiness  against mechanical cheerfulness  against suspicion  i struggle by remembering my friends  others i have known by remembering some place  some beloved place or tree  we thought you one of these 
3476,of course  if there s been any misunderstanding  mumbled leonard  all i can do is to go 
3477,but i beg to state   he paused  ahab and jezebel danced at his boots and made him look ridiculous  you were picking my brain for official information  i can prove it  i   he blew his nose and left them 
3478,can i help you now 
3479,said mr  wilcox  turning to margaret 
3480,may i have one quiet word with him in the hall 
3481,helen  go after him  do anything  anything  to make the noodle understand 
3482,helen hesitated 
3483,but really   said their visitor 
3484,ought she to 
3485,at once she went 
3486,he resumed 
3487,i would have chimed in  but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves  i didn t interfere  you were splendid  miss schlegel  absolutely splendid 
3488,you can take my word for it  but there are very few women who could have managed him 
3489,oh yes  said margaret distractedly 
3490,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me  cried evie 
3491,yes  indeed  chuckled her father  all that part about mechanical cheerfulness   oh  fine 
3492,i m very sorry  said margaret  collecting herself 
3493,he s a nice creature really 
3494,i cannot think what set him off 
3495,it has been most unpleasant for you 
3496,oh  i didn t mind 
3497,then he changed his mood 
3498,he asked if he might speak as an old friend  and  permission given  said  oughtn t you really to be more careful 
3499,margaret laughed  though her thoughts still strayed after helen 
3500,do you realise that it s all your fault 
3501,she said 
3502,you re responsible 
3503,this is the young man whom we were to warn against the porphyrion 
3504,we warn him  and  look 
3505,mr  wilcox was annoyed 
3506,i hardly consider that a fair deduction  he said 
3507,obviously unfair  said margaret 
3508,i was only thinking how tangled things are 
3509,it s our fault mostly  neither yours nor his 
3510,not his 
3511,miss schlegel  you are too kind 
3512,yes  indeed  nodded evie  a little contemptuously 
3513,you behave much too well to people  and then they impose on you 
3514,i know the world and that type of man  and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly 
3515,you must keep that type at a distance 
3516,otherwise they forget themselves 
3517,sad  but true 
3518,they aren t our sort  and one must face the fact 
3519,ye  es 
3520,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman 
3521,i admit it willingly  said margaret  who was pacing up and down the room 
3522,a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself 
3523,mr  wilcox watched her with a vague uneasiness 
3524,what did he suspect you of 
3525,of wanting to make money out of him 
3526,intolerable brute 
3527,but how were you to benefit 
3528,exactly 
3529,how indeed 
3530,just horrible  corroding suspicion 
3531,one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away 
3532,just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes 
3533,i come back to my original point 
3534,you ought to be more careful  miss schlegel 
3535,your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in 
3536,she turned to him frankly 
3537,let me explain exactly why we like this man  and want to see him again 
3538,that s your clever way of talking 
3539,i shall never believe you like him 
3540,i do 
3541,firstly  because he cares for physical adventure  just as you do 
3542,yes  you go motoring and shooting  he would like to go camping out 
3543,secondly  he cares for something special in adventure 
3544,it is quickest to call that special something poetry  
3545,oh  he s one of that writer sort 
3546,no  oh no  i mean he may be  but it would be loathsome stuff  his brain is filled with the husks of books  culture  horrible  we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing 
3547,we want to show him how he may get upsides with life 
3548,as i said  either friends or the country  some   she hesitated   either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey  and to show that it is grey 
3549,if possible  one should have both 
3550,some of her words ran past mr  wilcox 
3551,he let them run past 
3552,others he caught and criticised with admirable lucidity 
3553,your mistake is this  and it is a very common mistake 
3554,this young bounder has a life of his own 
3555,what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life  or  as you call it  grey  
3556,because  
3557,one minute 
3558,you know nothing about him 
3559,he probably has his own joys and interests  wife  children  snug little home  that s where we practical fellows he smiled   are more tolerant than you intellectuals 
3560,we live and let live  and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere  and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs 
3561,i quite grant  i look at the faces of the clerks in my own office  and observe them to be dull  but i don t know what s going on beneath 
3562,so  by the way  with london 
3563,i have heard you rail against london  miss schlegel  and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you 
3564,what do you know about london 
3565,you only see civilisation from the outside 
3566,i don t say in your case  but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity  discontent  and socialism 
3567,she admitted the strength of his position  though it undermined imagination 
3568,as he spoke  some outposts of poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining  and she retreated to what she called her second line   to the special facts of the case 
3569,his wife is an old bore  she said simply 
3570,he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone  and she thought he was with us 
3571,with you 
3572,yes 
3573,evie tittered 
3574,he hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed 
3575,he needs outside interests 
3576,naughty young man  cried the girl 
3577,naughty 
3578,said margaret  who hated naughtiness more than sin 
3579,when you re married miss wilcox  won t you want outside interests 
3580,he has apparently got them  put in mr  wilcox slyly 
3581,yes  indeed  father 
3582,he was tramping in surrey  if you mean that  said margaret  pacing away rather crossly 
3583,oh  i dare say 
3584,miss wilcox  he was 
3585,m  m  m  m  from mr  wilcox  who thought the episode amusing  if risque 
3586,with most ladies he would not have discussed it  but he was trading on margaret s reputation as an emancipated woman 
3587,he said so  and about such a thing he wouldn t lie 
3588,they both began to laugh 
3589,that s where i differ from you 
3590,men lie about their positions and prospects  but not about a thing of that sort 
3591,he shook his head 
3592,miss schlegel  excuse me  but i know the type 
3593,i said before  he isn t a type 
3594,he cares about adventures rightly 
3595,he s certain that our smug existence isn t all 
3596,he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish  but don t think that sums him up 
3597,there s manhood in him as well 
3598,yes  that s what i m trying to say 
3599,he s a real man 
3600,as she spoke their eyes met  and it was as if mr  wilcox s defences fell 
3601,she saw back to the real man in him 
3602,unwittingly she had touched his emotions 
3603,a woman and two men  they had formed the magic triangle of sex  and the male was thrilled to jealousy  in case the female was attracted by another male 
3604,love  say the ascetics  reveals our shameful kinship with the beasts 
3605,be it so  one can bear that  jealousy is the real shame 
3606,it is jealousy  not love  that connects us with the farmyard intolerably  and calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen 
3607,margaret crushed complacency down because she was civilised 
3608,mr  wilcox  uncivilised  continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his defences  and was again presenting a bastion to the world 
3609,miss schlegel  you re a pair of dear creatures  but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world 
3610,what does your brother say 
3611,i forget 
3612,surely he has some opinion 
3613,he laughs  if i remember correctly 
3614,he s very clever  isn t he 
3615,said evie  who had met and detested tibby at oxford 
3616,yes  pretty well  but i wonder what helen s doing 
3617,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing  said mr  wilcox 
3618,margaret went out to the landing 
3619,she heard no sound  and mr  bast s topper was missing from the hall 
3620,helen  she called 
3621,yes  replied a voice from the library 
3622,you in there 
3623,yes  he s gone some time 
3624,margaret went to her 
3625,why  you re all alone  she said 
3626,yes  it s all right  meg  poor  poor creature  
3627,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later  mr 
3628,w much concerned  and slightly titillated 
3629,oh  i ve no patience with him 
3630,i hate him 
3631,poor dear mr  bast  he wanted to talk literature  and we would talk business 
3632,such a muddle of a man  and yet so worth pulling through 
3633,i like him extraordinarily 
3634,well done  said margaret  kissing her  but come into the drawing room now  and don t talk about him to the wilcoxes 
3635,make light of the whole thing 
3636,helen came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitor  this hen at all events was fancy free 
3637,he s gone with my blessing  she cried  and now for puppies 
3638,as they drove away  mr  wilcox said to his daughter 
3639,i am really concerned at the way those girls go on 
3640,they are as clever as you make them  but unpractical  god bless me  one of these days they ll go too far  girls like that oughtn t to live alone in london  until they marry  they ought to have some one to look after them  we must look in more often  we re better than no one 
3641,you like them  don t you  evie 
3642,evie replied  helen s right enough  but i can t stand the toothy one 
3643,and i shouldn t have called either of them girls 
3644,evie had grown up handsome 
3645,dark eyed  with the glow of youth under sunburn  built firmly and firm lipped  she was the best the wilcoxes could do in the way of feminine beauty 
3646,for the present  puppies and her father were the only things she loved  but the net of matrimony was being prepared for her  and a few days later she was attracted to a mr  percy cahill  an uncle of mrs  charles s  and he was attracted to her 
3647,the age of property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor 
3648,when a move is imminent  furniture becomes ridiculous  and margaret now lay awake at nights wondering where  where on earth they and all their belongings would be deposited in september next 
3649,chairs  tables  pictures  books  that had rumbled down to them through the generations  must rumble forward again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to give the final push  and send toppling into the sea 
3650,but there were all their father s books  they never read them  but they were their father s  and must be kept 
3651,there was the marble topped chiffonier  their mother had set store by it  they could not remember why 
3652,round every knob and cushion in the house gathered a sentiment that was at times personal  but more often a faint piety to the dead  a prolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave 
3653,it was absurd  if you came to think of it  helen and tibby came to think of it  margaret was too busy with the house agents 
3654,the feudal ownership of land did bring dignity  whereas the modern ownership of movables is reducing us again to a nomadic horde 
3655,we are reverting to the civilisation of luggage  and historians of the future will note how the middle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth  and may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty 
3656,the schlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of wickham place 
3657,it had helped to balance their lives  and almost to counsel them 
3658,nor is their ground landlord spiritually the richer 
3659,he has built flats on its site  his motor cars grow swifter  his exposures of socialism more trenchant 
3660,but he has spilt the precious distillation of the years  and no chemistry of his can give it back to society again 
3661,margaret grew depressed  she was anxious to settle on a house before they left town to pay their annual visit to mrs  munt 
3662,she enjoyed this visit  and wanted to have her mind at ease for it 
3663,swanage  though dull  was stable  and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air and for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north 
3664,but london thwarted her  in its atmosphere she could not concentrate 
3665,london only stimulates  it cannot sustain  and margaret  hurrying over its surface for a house without knowing what sort of a house she wanted  was paying for many a thrilling sensation in the past 
3666,she could not even break loose from culture  and her time was wasted by concerts which it would be a sin to miss  and invitations which it would never do to refuse 
3667,at last she grew desperate  she resolved that she would go nowhere and be at home to no one until she found a house  and broke the resolution in half an hour 
3668,once she had humorously lamented that she had never been to simpson s restaurant in the strand 
3669,now a note arrived from miss wilcox  asking her to lunch there 
3670,mr cahill was coming and the three would have such a jolly chat  and perhaps end up at the hippodrome 
3671,margaret had no strong regard for evie  and no desire to meet her fiance  and she was surprised that helen  who had been far funnier about simpson s  had not been asked instead 
3672,but the invitation touched her by its intimate tone 
3673,she must know evie wilcox better than she supposed  and declaring that she simply must  she accepted 
3674,but when she saw evie at the entrance of the restaurant  staring fiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic women  her heart failed her anew 
3675,miss wilcox had changed perceptibly since her engagement 
3676,her voice was gruffer  her manner more downright  and she was inclined to patronise the more foolish virgin 
3677,margaret was silly enough to be pained at this 
3678,depressed at her isolation  she saw not only houses and furniture  but the vessel of life itself slipping past her  with people like evie and mr  cahill on board 
3679,there are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us  and one of them came to her at simpson s in the strand 
3680,as she trod the staircase  narrow  but carpeted thickly  as she entered the eating room  where saddles of mutton were being trundled up to expectant clergymen  she had a strong  if erroneous  conviction of her own futility  and wished she had never come out of her backwater  where nothing happened except art and literature  and where no one ever got married or succeeded in remaining engaged 
3681,then came a little surprise 
3682,father might be of the party  yes  father was 
3683,with a smile of pleasure she moved forward to greet him  and her feeling of loneliness vanished 
3684,i thought i d get round if i could  said he 
3685,evie told me of her little plan  so i just slipped in and secured a table 
3686,always secure a table first 
3687,evie  don t pretend you want to sit by your old father  because you don t 
3688,miss schlegel  come in my side  out of pity 
3689,my goodness  but you look tired 
3690,been worrying round after your young clerks 
3691,no  after houses  said margaret  edging past him into the box 
3692,i m hungry  not tired  i want to eat heaps 
3693,that s good 
3694,what ll you have 
3695,fish pie  said she  with a glance at the menu 
3696,fish pie 
3697,fancy coming for fish pie to simpson s 
3698,it s not a bit the thing to go for here 
3699,go for something for me  then  said margaret  pulling off her gloves 
3700,her spirits were rising  and his reference to leonard bast had warmed her curiously 
3701,saddle of mutton  said he after profound reflection  and cider to drink 
3702,that s the type of thing 
3703,i like this place  for a joke  once in a way 
3704,it is so thoroughly old english 
3705,don t you agree 
3706,yes  said margaret  who didn t 
3707,the order was given  the joint rolled up  and the carver  under mr  wilcox s direction  cut the meat where it was succulent  and piled their plates high 
3708,mr  cahill insisted on sirloin  but admitted that he had made a mistake later on 
3709,he and evie soon fell into a conversation of the no  i didn t  yes  you did type  conversation which  though fascinating to those who are engaged in it  neither desires nor deserves the attention of others 
3710,it s a golden rule to tip the carver 
3711,tip everywhere s my motto 
3712,perhaps it does make life more human 
3713,then the fellows know one again 
3714,especially in the east  if you tip  they remember you from year s end to year s end 
3715,have you been in the east 
3716,oh  greece and the levant 
3717,i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus  some military society of a sort there 
3718,a few piastres  properly distributed  help to keep one s memory green 
3719,but you  of course  think this shockingly cynical 
3720,how s your discussion society getting on 
3721,any new utopias lately 
3722,no  i m house hunting  mr  wilcox  as i ve already told you once 
3723,do you know of any houses 
3724,afraid i don t 
3725,well  what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house 
3726,we merely want a small house with large rooms  and plenty of them 
3727,evie  i like that 
3728,miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her 
3729,what s that  father 
3730,i want a new home in september  and some one must find it 
3731,i can t 
3732,percy  do you know of anything 
3733,i can t say i do  said mr  cahill 
3734,how like you 
3735,you re never any good 
3736,never any good 
3737,just listen to her 
3738,never any good 
3739,oh  come 
3740,well  you aren t 
3741,miss schlegel  is he 
3742,the torrent of their love  having splashed these drops at margaret  swept away on its habitual course 
3743,she sympathised with it now  for a little comfort had restored her geniality 
3744,speech and silence pleased her equally  and while mr  wilcox made some preliminary inquiries about cheese  her eyes surveyed the restaurant  and aired its well calculated tributes to the solidity of our past 
3745,though no more old english than the works of kipling  it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly that her criticism was lulled  and the guests whom it was nourishing for imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of parson adams or tom jones 
3746,scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the ear 
3747,right you are 
3748,i ll cable out to uganda this evening  came from the table behind 
3749,their emperor wants war  well  let him have it  was the opinion of a clergyman 
3750,she smiled at such incongruities 
3751,next time  she said to mr  wilcox  you shall come to lunch with me at mr  eustace miles s 
3752,with pleasure 
3753,no  you d hate it  she said  pushing her glass towards him for some more cider 
3754,it s all proteids and body buildings  and people come up to you and beg your pardon  but you have such a beautiful aura 
3755,a what 
3756,never heard of an aura 
3757,oh  happy  happy man 
3758,i scrub at mine for hours 
3759,nor of an astral plane 
3760,he had heard of astral planes  and censured them 
3761,just so 
3762,luckily it was helen s aura  not mine  and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses 
3763,i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went 
3764,funny experiences seem to come to you two girls 
3765,no one s ever asked me about my  what d ye call it 
3766,perhaps i ve not got one 
3767,you re bound to have one  but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it 
3768,tell me  though  miss schlegel  do you really believe in the supernatural and all that 
3769,too difficult a question 
3770,why s that 
3771,gruyere or stilton 
3772,gruyere  please 
3773,better have stilton 
3774,stilton 
3775,because  though i don t believe in auras  and think theosophy s only a halfway house  
3776,  yet there may be something in it all the same  he concluded  with a frown 
3777,not even that 
3778,it may be halfway in the wrong direction 
3779,i can t explain 
3780,i don t believe in all these fads  and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them 
3781,he seemed unsatisfied  and said  so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it 
3782,i could  said margaret  surprised that the point was of any importance to him 
3783,indeed  i will 
3784,when i talked about scrubbing my aura  i was only trying to be funny 
3785,but why do you want this settled 
3786,i don t know 
3787,now  mr  wilcox  you do know 
3788,yes  i am  no  you re not  burst from the lovers opposite 
3789,margaret was silent for a moment  and then changed the subject 
3790,how s your house 
3791,much the same as when you honoured it last week 
3792,i don t mean ducie street 
3793,howards end  of course 
3794,why of course  
3795,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us 
3796,we re nearly demented 
3797,let me think 
3798,i wish i could help you 
3799,but i thought you wanted to be in town 
3800,one bit of advice  fix your district  then fix your price  and then don t budge 
3801,that s how i got both ducie street and oniton 
3802,i said to myself  i mean to be exactly here  and i was  and oniton s a place in a thousand 
3803,but i do budge 
3804,gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses  cow them with an eye  and up they come  trembling 
3805,ladies can t 
3806,it s the houses that are mesmerising me  i ve no control over the saucy things 
3807,houses are alive 
3808,i m out of my depth  he said  and added  didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy 
3809,did i   i mean i did  more or less  i talk the same way to every one  or try to 
3810,yes  i know 
3811,and how much of it do you suppose he understood 
3812,that s his lookout 
3813,i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company 
3814,one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough  but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food 
3815,there s no nourishment in it 
3816,you pass it to the lower classes  and they pass it back to you  and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour  when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything 
3817,our friends at chelsea don t see this 
3818,they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible  and sacrifice  
3819,lower classes  interrupted mr  wilcox  as it were thrusting his hand into her speech 
3820,well  you do admit that there are rich and poor 
3821,that s something 
3822,margaret could not reply 
3823,was he incredibly stupid  or did he understand her better than she understood herself 
3824,you do admit that  if wealth was divided up equally  in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same 
3825,the hard working man would come to the top  the wastrel sink to the bottom 
3826,every one admits that 
3827,your socialists don t 
3828,my socialists do 
3829,yours mayn t  but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists  but ninepins  which you have constructed for your own amusement 
3830,i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily 
3831,he would have resented this had she not been a woman 
3832,but women may say anything  it was one of his holiest beliefs  and he only retorted  with a gay smile  i don t care 
3833,you ve made two damaging admissions  and i m heartily with you in both 
3834,in time they finished lunch  and margaret  who had excused herself from the hippodrome  took her leave 
3835,evie had scarcely addressed her  and she suspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father 
3836,he and she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more intimate acquaintance 
3837,it had begun long ago 
3838,she had been his wife s friend and  as such  he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a memento 
3839,it was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette  and he had always preferred her to helen  unlike most men 
3840,but the advance had been astonishing lately 
3841,they had done more in a week than in two years  and were really beginning to know each other 
3842,she did not forget his promise to sample eustace miles  and asked him as soon as she could secure tibby as his chaperon 
3843,he came  and partook of body building dishes with humility 
3844,next morning the schlegels left for swanage 
3845,they had not succeeded in finding a new home 
3846,as they were seated at aunt juley s breakfast table at the bays  parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay  a letter came for margaret and threw her into perturbation 
3847,it was from mr  wilcox 
3848,it announced an important change in his plans 
3849,owing to evie s marriage  he had decided to give up his house in ducie street  and was willing to let it on a yearly tenancy 
3850,it was a businesslike letter  and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would not do 
3851,also the rent 
3852,if they approved  margaret was to come up at once  the words were underlined  as is necessary when dealing with women  and to go over the house with him 
3853,if they disapproved  a wire would oblige  as he should put it into the hands of an agent 
3854,the letter perturbed  because she was not sure what it meant 
3855,if he liked her  if he had manoeuvred to get her to simpson s  might this be a manoeuvre to get her to london  and result in an offer of marriage 
3856,she put it to herself as indelicately as possible  in the hope that her brain would cry  rubbish  you re a self conscious fool 
3857,but her brain only tingled a little and was silent  and for a time she sat gazing at the mincing waves  and wondering whether the news would seem strange to the others 
3858,as soon as she began speaking  the sound of her own voice reassured her 
3859,there could be nothing in it 
3860,the replies also were typical  and in the burr of conversation her fears vanished 
3861,you needn t go though   began her hostess 
3862,i needn t  but hadn t i better 
3863,it s really getting rather serious 
3864,we let chance after chance slip  and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street 
3865,we don t know what we want  that s the mischief with us  
3866,no  we have no real ties  said helen  helping herself to toast 
3867,shan t i go up to town to day  take the house if it s the least possible  and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow  and start enjoying myself 
3868,i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind 
3869,but you won t do anything rash  margaret 
3870,there s nothing rash to do 
3871,who are the wilcoxes 
3872,said tibby  a question that sounds silly  but was really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried to answer it 
3873,i don t manage the wilcoxes  i don t see where they come in 
3874,no more do i  agreed helen 
3875,it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them 
3876,out of all our hotel acquaintances  mr  wilcox is the only one who has stuck 
3877,it is now over three years  and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time 
3878,interesting people don t get one houses 
3879,meg  if you start in your honest english vein  i shall throw the treacle at you 
3880,it s a better vein than the cosmopolitan  said margaret  getting up 
3881,now  children  which is it to be 
3882,you know the ducie street house 
3883,shall i say yes or shall i say no 
3884,tibby love  which 
3885,i m specially anxious to pin you both 
3886,it all depends on what meaning you attach to the word possible
3887,it depends on nothing of the sort 
3888,say yes 
3889,say no 
3890,then margaret spoke rather seriously 
3891,i think  she said  that our race is degenerating 
3892,we cannot settle even this little thing  what will it be like when we have to settle a big one 
3893,it will be as easy as eating  returned helen 
3894,i was thinking of father 
3895,how could he settle to leave germany as he did  when he had fought for it as a young man  and all his feelings and friends were prussian 
3896,how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else 
3897,it would have killed me 
3898,when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals  and we  at our age  can t change houses 
3899,it s humiliating 
3900,your father may have been able to change countries  said mrs  munt with asperity  and that may or may not be a good thing 
3901,but he could change houses no better than you can  in fact  much worse 
3902,never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester 
3903,i knew it  cried helen 
3904,i told you so 
3905,it is the little things one bungles at 
3906,the big  real ones are nothing when they come 
3907,bungle  my dear 
3908,you are too little to recollect  in fact  you weren t there  but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed  and emily took train with baby  who was margaret then  and the smaller luggage for london  without so much as knowing where her new home would be 
3909,getting away from that house may be hard  but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it 
3910,helen  with her mouth full  cried 
3911,and that s the man who beat the austrians  and the danes  and the french  and who beat the germans that were inside himself 
3912,and we re like him 
3913,speak for yourself  said tibby 
3914,remember that i am cosmopolitan  please 
3915,helen may be right 
3916,of course she s right  said helen 
3917,helen might be right  but she did not go up to london 
3918,margaret did that 
3919,an interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries  and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends 
3920,she could not believe that her father had ever felt the same 
3921,her eyes had been troubling her lately  so that she could not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape  which she had seen but yesterday 
3922,at southampton she waved to frieda  frieda was on her way down to join them at swanage  and mrs  munt had calculated that their trains would cross 
3923,but frieda was looking the other way  and margaret travelled on to town feeling solitary and old maidish 
3924,how like an old maid to fancy that mr  wilcox was courting her 
3925,she had once visited a spinster  poor  silly  and unattractive  whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love 
3926,how margaret s heart had bled for the deluded thing 
3927,how she had lectured  reasoned  and in despair acquiesced 
3928,i may have been deceived by the curate  my dear  but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me  and has  as a matter of fact   it had always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age  yet she might be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity 
3929,mr  wilcox met her at waterloo himself 
3930,she felt certain that he was not the same as usual  for one thing  he took offence at everything she said 
3931,this is awfully kind of you  she began  but i m afraid it s not going to do 
3932,the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family 
3933,what 
3934,have you come up determined not to deal 
3935,not exactly 
3936,not exactly 
3937,in that case let s be starting 
3938,she lingered to admire the motor  which was new  and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne aunt juley to her doom three years before 
3939,presumably it s very beautiful  she said 
3940,how do you like it  crane 
3941,come  let s be starting  repeated her host 
3942,how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane 
3943,why  i know crane  i ve been for a drive with evie once 
3944,i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton 
3945,i know all sorts of things 
3946,evie  he echoed in injured tones 
3947,you won t see her 
3948,she s gone out with cahill 
3949,it s no fun  i can tell you  being left so much alone 
3950,i ve got my work all day  indeed  a great deal too much of it  but when i come home in the evening  i tell you  i can t stand the house 
3951,in my absurd way  i m lonely too  margaret replied 
3952,it s heart breaking to leave one s old home 
3953,i scarcely remember anything before wickham place  and helen and tibby were born there 
3954,helen says  
3955,you  too  feel lonely 
3956,horribly 
3957,hullo  parliament s back 
3958,mr  wilcox glanced at parliament contemptuously 
3959,the more important ropes of life lay elsewhere 
3960,yes  they are talking again  said he 
3961,but you were going to say  
3962,only some rubbish about furniture 
3963,helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish  and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas  just imagine it   rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them 
3964,your sister always likes her little joke 
3965,she says yes  my brother says  no  to ducie street 
3966,it s no fun helping us  mr  wilcox  i assure you 
3967,you are not as unpractical as you pretend 
3968,i shall never believe it 
3969,margaret laughed 
3970,but she was  quite as unpractical 
3971,she could not concentrate on details 
3972,parliament  the thames  the irresponsive chauffeur  would flash into the field of house hunting  and all demand some comment or response 
3973,it is impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole  and she had chosen to see it whole 
3974,mr  wilcox saw steadily 
3975,he never bothered over the mysterious or the private 
3976,the thames might run inland from the sea  the chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin 
3977,they knew their own business  and he knew his 
3978,yet she liked being with him 
3979,he was not a rebuke  but a stimulus  and banished morbidity 
3980,some twenty years her senior  he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lost  not youth s creative power  but its self confidence and optimism 
3981,he was so sure that it was a very pleasant world 
3982,his complexion was robust  his hair had receded but not thinned  the thick moustache and the eyes that helen had compared to brandy balls had an agreeable menace in them  whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the stars 
3983,some day  in the millennium  there may be no need for his type 
3984,at present  homage is due to it from those who think themselves superior  and who possibly are 
3985,at all events you responded to my telegram promptly  he remarked 
3986,oh  even i know a good thing when i see it 
3987,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world 
3988,heavens  no 
3989,only idiots and prigs do that 
3990,i am glad  very glad  he repeated  suddenly softening and turning to her  as if the remark had pleased him 
3991,there is so much cannot talked in would be intellectual circles 
3992,i am glad you don t share it 
3993,self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character 
3994,but i can t stand those people who run down comforts 
3995,they have usually some axe to grind 
3996,can you 
3997,comforts are of two kinds  said margaret  who was keeping herself in hand   those we can share with others  like fire  weather  or music  and those we can t  food  food  for instance 
3998,it depends 
3999,i mean reasonable comforts  of course 
4000,i shouldn t like to think that you   he bent nearer  the sentence died unfinished 
4001,margaret s head turned very stupid  and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse 
4002,he did not kiss her  for the hour was half past twelve  and the car was passing by the stables of buckingham palace 
4003,but the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on her account  and she was surprised that crane did not realise this  and turn round 
4004,idiot though she might be  surely mr  wilcox was more  how should one put it   more psychological than usual 
4005,always a good judge of character for business purposes  he seemed this afternoon to enlarge his field  and to note qualities outside neatness  obedience  and decision 
4006,i want to go over the whole house  she announced when they arrived 
4007,as soon as i get back to swanage  which will be to morrow afternoon  i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby  and wire you yes or no 
4008,right 
4009,the dining room 
4010,and they began their survey 
4011,the dining room was big  but over furnished 
4012,chelsea would have moaned aloud 
4013,mr  wilcox had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince  and relent  and refrain  and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck 
4014,after so much self colour and self denial  margaret viewed with relief the sumptuous dado  the frieze  the gilded wall paper  amid whose foliage parrots sang 
4015,it would never do with her own furniture  but those heavy chairs  that immense sideboard loaded with presentation plate  stood up against its pressure like men 
4016,the room suggested men  and margaret  keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past  saw it as an ancient guest hall  where the lord sat at meat among his thanes 
4017,even the bible  the dutch bible that charles had brought back from the boer war  fell into position 
4018,such a room admitted loot 
4019,now the entrance hall 
4020,the entrance hall was paved 
4021,here we fellows smoke 
4022,we fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather 
4023,it was as if a motor car had spawned 
4024,oh  jolly  said margaret  sinking into one of them 
4025,you do like it 
4026,he said  fixing his eyes on her upturned face  and surely betraying an almost intimate note 
4027,it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable 
4028,isn t it 
4029,ye  es 
4030,semi rubbish 
4031,are those cruikshanks 
4032,gillrays 
4033,shall we go on upstairs 
4034,does all this furniture come from howards end 
4035,the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton 
4036,does  however  i m concerned with the house  not the furniture 
4037,how big is this smoking room 
4038,thirty by fifteen 
4039,no  wait a minute 
4040,fifteen and a half 
4041,ah  well 
4042,mr  wilcox  aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses 
4043,they proceeded to the drawing room 
4044,chelsea managed better here 
4045,it was sallow and ineffective 
4046,one could visualise the ladies withdrawing to it  while their lords discussed life s realities below  to the accompaniment of cigars 
4047,had mrs  wilcox s drawing room at howards end looked thus 
4048,just as this thought entered margaret s brain  mr  wilcox did ask her to be his wife  and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly fainted 
4049,but the proposal was not to rank among the world s great love scenes 
4050,miss schlegel   his voice was firm   i have had you up on false pretences 
4051,i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house 
4052,margaret almost answered  i know  
4053,could you be induced to share my  is it probable  
4054,oh  mr  wilcox  she interrupted  taking hold of the piano and averting her eyes 
4055,i see  i see 
4056,i will write to you afterwards if i may 
4057,he began to stammer 
4058,miss schlegel  margaret you don t understand 
4059,oh yes 
4060,indeed  yes  said margaret 
4061,i am asking you to be my wife 
4062,so deep already was her sympathy  that when he said  i am asking you to be my wife  she made herself give a little start 
4063,she must show surprise if he expected it 
4064,an immense joy came over her 
4065,it was indescribable 
4066,it had nothing to do with humanity  and most resembled the all pervading happiness of fine weather 
4067,fine weather is due to the sun  but margaret could think of no central radiance here 
4068,she stood in his drawing room happy  and longing to give happiness 
4069,on leaving him she realised that the central radiance had been love 
4070,you aren t offended  miss schlegel 
4071,how could i be offended 
4072,there was a moment s pause 
4073,he was anxious to get rid of her  and she knew it 
4074,she had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money cannot buy 
4075,he desired comradeship and affection  but he feared them  and she  who had taught herself only to desire  and could have clothed the struggle with beauty  held back  and hesitated with him 
4076,good bye  she continued 
4077,you will have a letter from me  i am going back to swanage to morrow 
4078,thank you 
4079,good bye  and it s you i thank 
4080,i may order the motor round  mayn t i 
4081,that would be most kind 
4082,i wish i had written 
4083,ought i to have written 
4084,not at all 
4085,there s just one question  
4086,she shook her head 
4087,he looked a little bewildered as they parted 
4088,they parted without shaking hands  she had kept the interview  for his sake  in tints of the quietest grey 
4089,she thrilled with happiness ere she reached her house 
4090,others had loved her in the past  if one apply to their brief desires so grave a word  but the others had been ninnies   young men who had nothing to do  old men who could find nobody better 
4091,and she had often loved  too  but only so far as the facts of sex demanded  mere yearnings for the masculine sex to be dismissed for what they were worth  with a sigh 
4092,never before had her personality been touched 
4093,she was not young or very rich  and it amazed her that a man of any standing should take her seriously 
4094,as she sat  trying to do accounts in her empty house  amidst beautiful pictures and noble books  waves of emotion broke  as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night air 
4095,she shook her head  tried to concentrate her attention  and failed 
4096,in vain did she repeat  but i ve been through this sort of thing before 
4097,she had never been through it  the big machinery  as opposed to the little  had been set in motion  and the idea that mr  wilcox loved  obsessed her before she came to love him in return 
4098,she would come to no decision yet 
4099,oh  sir  this is so sudden   that prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came 
4100,premonitions are not preparation 
4101,she must examine more closely her own nature and his  she must talk it over judicially with helen 
4102,it had been a strange love scene  the central radiance unacknowledged from first to last  she  in his place  would have said ich liebe dich  but perhaps it was not his habit to open the heart  he might have done it if she had pressed him  as a matter of duty  perhaps  england expects every man to open his heart once  but the effort would have jarred him  and never  if she could avoid it  should he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against the world 
4103,he must never be bothered with emotional talk  or with a display of sympathy 
4104,he was an elderly man now  and it would be futile and impudent to correct him 
4105,mrs  wilcox strayed in and out  ever a welcome ghost  surveying the scene  thought margaret  without one hint of bitterness 
4106,if one wanted to show a foreigner england  perhaps the wisest course would be to take him to the final section of the purbeck hills  and stand him on their summit  a few miles to the east of corfe 
4107,then system after system of our island would roll together under his feet 
4108,beneath him is the valley of the frome  and all the wild lands that come tossing down from dorchester  black and gold  to mirror their gorse in the expanses of poole 
4109,the valley of the stour is beyond  unaccountable stream  dirty at blandford  pure at wimborne  the stour  sliding out of fat fields  to marry the avon beneath the tower of christ church  the valley of the avon  invisible  but far to the north the trained eye may see clearbury ring that guards it  and the imagination may leap beyond that on to salisbury plain itself  and beyond the plain to all the glorious downs of central england 
4110,nor is suburbia absent 
4111,bournemouth s ignoble coast cowers to the right  heralding the pine trees that mean  for all their beauty  red houses  and the stock exchange  and extend to the gates of london itself 
4112,so tremendous is the city s trail 
4113,but the cliffs of freshwater it shall never touch  and the island will guard the island s purity till the end of time 
4114,seen from the west the wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty 
4115,it is as if a fragment of england floated forward to greet the foreigner  chalk of our chalk  turf of our turf  epitome of what will follow 
4116,and behind the fragment lies southampton  hostess to the nations  and portsmouth  a latent fire  and all around it  with double and treble collision of tides  swirls the sea 
4117,how many villages appear in this view 
4118,how many castles 
4119,how many churches  vanished or triumphant 
4120,how many ships  railways  and roads 
4121,what incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final end 
4122,the reason fails  like a wave on the swanage beach  the imagination swells  spreads  and deepens  until it becomes geographic and encircles england 
4123,so frieda mosebach  now frau architect liesecke  and mother to her husband s baby  was brought up to these heights to be impressed  and  after a prolonged gaze  she said that the hills were more swelling here than in pomerania  which was true  but did not seem to mrs  munt apposite 
4124,poole harbour was dry  which led her to praise the absence of muddy foreshore at friedrich wilhelms bad  rugen  where beech trees hang over the tideless baltic  and cows may contemplate the brine 
4125,rather unhealthy mrs  munt thought this would be  water being safer when it moved about 
4126,and your english lakes  vindermere  grasmere they  then  unhealthy 
4127,no  frau liesecke  but that is because they are fresh water  and different 
4128,salt water ought to have tides  and go up and down a great deal  or else it smells 
4129,look  for instance  at an aquarium 
4130,an aquarium 
4131,oh  meesis munt  you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt 
4132,why  then victor  my brother in law  collected many tadpoles   you are not to say stink  interrupted helen  at least  you may say it  but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it 
4133,then smell 
4134,and the mud of your pool down there  does it not smell  or may i say stink  ha  ha 
4135,there always has been mud in poole harbour  said mrs  munt  with a slight frown 
4136,the rivers bring it down  and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it 
4137,yes  that is so  conceded frieda  and another international incident was closed 
4138,bournemouth is  resumed their hostess  quoting a local rhyme to which she was much attached   bournemouth is  poole was  and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three 
4139,now  frau liesecke  i have shown you bournemouth  and i have shown you poole  so let us walk backward a little  and look down again at swanage 
4140,aunt juley  wouldn t that be meg s train 
4141,a tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour  and now was bearing southwards towards them over the black and the gold 
4142,oh  dearest margaret  i do hope she won t be overtired 
4143,oh  i do wonder  i do wonder whether she s taken the house 
4144,i hope she hasn t been hasty 
4145,so do i  oh  so do i 
4146,will it be as beautiful as wickham place 
4147,frieda asked 
4148,i should think it would 
4149,trust mr  wilcox for doing himself proud 
4150,all those ducie street houses are beautiful in their modern way  and i can t think why he doesn t keep on with it 
4151,but it s really for evie that he went there  and now that evie s going to be married  
4152,you ve never seen miss wilcox  frieda 
4153,how absurdly matrimonial you are 
4154,but sister to that paul 
4155,yes 
4156,and to that charles  said mrs  munt with feeling 
4157,oh  helen  helen  what a time that was 
4158,helen laughed 
4159,meg and i haven t got such tender hearts 
4160,if there s a chance of a cheap house  we go for it 
4161,now look  frau liesecke  at my niece s train 
4162,you see  it is coming towards us  coming  coming  and  when it gets to corfe  it will actually go through the downs  on which we are standing  so that  if we walk over  as i suggested  and look down on swanage  we shall see it coming on the other side 
4163,shall we 
4164,frieda assented  and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser 
4165,rather a dull valley lay below  backed by the slope of the coastward downs 
4166,they were looking across the isle of purbeck and on to swanage  soon to be the most important town of all  and ugliest of the three 
4167,margaret s train reappeared as promised  and was greeted with approval by her aunt 
4168,it came to a standstill in the middle distance  and there it had been planned that tibby should meet her  and drive her  and a tea basket  up to join them 
4169,you see  continued helen to her cousin  the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles 
4170,they have  one  ducie street  two  howards end  where my great rumpus was  three  a country seat in shropshire  four  charles has a house in hilton  and five  another near epsom  and six  evie will have a house when she marries  and probably a pied a terre in the country  which makes seven 
4171,oh yes  and paul a hut in africa makes eight 
4172,i wish we could get howards end 
4173,that was something like a dear little house 
4174,didn t you think so  aunt juley 
4175,i had too much to do  dear  to look at it  said mrs  munt  with a gracious dignity 
4176,i had everything to settle and explain  and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides 
4177,it isn t likely i should remember much 
4178,i just remember having lunch in your bedroom 
4179,yes  so do i  but  oh dear  dear  how dreadful it all seems 
4180,and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement  you  and frieda  and meg  and mrs  wilcox  all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul 
4181,you yet may  said frieda despondently 
4182,helen shook her head 
4183,the great wilcox peril will never return 
4184,if i m certain of anything it s of that 
4185,one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions 
4186,the remark fell damply on the conversation 
4187,but helen slipped her arm round her cousin  somehow liking her the better for making it 
4188,it was not an original remark  nor had frieda appropriated it passionately  for she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind 
4189,yet it betrayed that interest in the universal which the average teuton possesses and the average englishman does not 
4190,it was  however illogically  the good  the beautiful  the true  as opposed to the respectable  the pretty  the adequate 
4191,it was a landscape of bocklin s beside a landscape of leader s  strident and ill considered  but quivering into supernatural life 
4192,it sharpened idealism  stirred the soul 
4193,it may have been a bad preparation for what followed 
4194,look  cried aunt juley  hurrying away from generalities over the narrow summit of the down 
4195,stand where i stand  and you will see the pony cart coming 
4196,i see the pony cart coming 
4197,they stood and saw the pony cart coming 
4198,margaret and tibby were presently seen coming in it 
4199,leaving the outskirts of swanage  it drove for a little through the budding lanes  and then began the ascent 
4200,have you got the house 
4201,they shouted  long before she could possibly hear 
4202,helen ran down to meet her 
4203,the highroad passed over a saddle  and a track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down 
4204,have you got the house 
4205,margaret shook her head 
4206,oh  what a nuisance 
4207,so we re as we were 
4208,not exactly 
4209,she got out  looking tired 
4210,some mystery  said tibby 
4211,we are to be enlightened presently 
4212,margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal of marriage from mr  wilcox 
4213,helen was amused 
4214,she opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through 
4215,it s just like a widower  she remarked 
4216,they ve cheek enough for anything  and invariably select one of their first wife s friends 
4217,margaret s face flashed despair 
4218,that type   she broke off with a cry 
4219,meg  not anything wrong with you 
4220,wait one minute  said margaret  whispering always 
4221,but you ve never conceivably  you ve never   she pulled herself together 
4222,tibby  hurry up through  i can t hold this gate indefinitely 
4223,aunt juley 
4224,i say  aunt juley  make the tea  will you  and frieda  we ve got to talk houses  and will come on afterwards 
4225,and then  turning her face to her sister s  she burst into tears 
4226,margaret was stupefied 
4227,she heard herself saying  oh  really   she felt herself touched with a hand that trembled 
4228,don t  sobbed helen  don t  don t  meg  don t 
4229,she seemed incapable of saying any other word 
4230,margaret  trembling herself  led her forward up the road  till they strayed through another gate on to the down 
4231,don t  don t do such a thing 
4232,i tell you not to  don t  i know  don t 
4233,what do you know 
4234,panic and emptiness  sobbed helen 
4235,don t 
4236,then margaret thought  helen is a little selfish 
4237,i have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying 
4238,she said  but we would still see each other very  often  and you  
4239,it s not a thing like that  sobbed helen 
4240,and she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards  stretching her hands towards the view and crying 
4241,what s happened to you 
4242,called margaret  following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills 
4243,but it s stupid 
4244,and suddenly stupidity seized her  and the immense landscape was blurred 
4245,but helen turned back 
4246,i don t know what s happened to either of us  said margaret  wiping her eyes 
4247,we must both have gone mad 
4248,then helen wiped hers  and they even laughed a little 
4249,look here  sit down 
4250,all right  i ll sit down if you ll sit down 
4251,there 
4252, one kiss  
4253,now  whatever  whatever is the matter 
4254,i do mean what i said 
4255,don t  it wouldn t do 
4256,oh  helen  stop saying don t  
4257,it s ignorant 
4258,it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime 
4259,don t is probably what mrs  bast says all the day to mr  bast 
4260,helen was silent 
4261,well 
4262,tell me about it first  and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime 
4263,that s better 
4264,well  where shall i begin 
4265,when i arrived at waterloo  no  i ll go back before that  because i m anxious you should know everything from the first  the first was about ten days ago  it was the day mr  bast came to tea and lost his temper  i was defending him  and mr  wilcox became jealous about me  however slightly  i thought it was the involuntary thing  which men can t help any more than we can  you know  at least  i know in my own case  when a man has said to me  so and so s a pretty girl  i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so  and long to tweak her ear 
4266,it s a tiresome feeling  but not an important one  and one easily manages it 
4267,but it wasn t only this in mr  wilcox s case  i gather now 
4268,then you love him 
4269,margaret considered 
4270,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you  she said 
4271,the mere fact of that grows more tremendous 
4272,remember  i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years 
4273,but loved him 
4274,margaret peered into her past 
4275,it is pleasant to analyse feelings while they are still only feelings  and unembodied in the social fabric 
4276,with her arm round helen  and her eyes shifting over the view  as if this country or that could reveal the secret of her own heart  she meditated honestly  and said  no 
4277,but you will 
4278,yes  said margaret  of that i m pretty sure 
4279,indeed  i began the moment he spoke to me 
4280,and have settled to marry him 
4281,i had  but am wanting a long talk about it now 
4282,what is it against him  helen 
4283,you must try and say 
4284,helen  in her turn  looked outwards 
4285,it is ever since paul  she said finally 
4286,but what has mr  wilcox to do with paul 
4287,but he was there  they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast  and saw that paul was frightened  the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen  so that i knew it was impossible  because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever  and not this outer life of telegrams and anger 
4288,she poured the sentence forth in one breath  but her sister understood it  because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them 
4289,that s foolish 
4290,in the first place  i disagree about the outer life 
4291,well  we ve often argued that 
4292,the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours 
4293,yours was romance  mine will be prose 
4294,i m not running it down  a very good kind of prose  but well considered  well thought out  for instance  i know all mr  wilcox s faults  he s afraid of emotion  he cares too much about success  too little about the past  his sympathy lacks poetry  and so isn t sympathy really  i d even say   she looked at the shining lagoons   that  spiritually  he s not as honest as i am 
4295,doesn t that satisfy you 
4296,no  it doesn t  said helen 
4297,it makes me feel worse and worse 
4298,you must be mad 
4299,margaret made a movement of irritation 
4300,i don t intend him  or any man or any woman  to be all my life  good heavens  no 
4301,there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t  and shall never  understand 
4302,thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union  before the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between married couples and the world 
4303,she was to keep her independence more than do most women as yet 
4304,marriage was to alter her fortunes rather than her character  and she was not far wrong in boasting that she understood her future husband 
4305,yet he did alter her character  a little 
4306,there was an unforeseen surprise  a cessation of the winds and odours of life  a social pressure that would have her think conjugally 
4307,so with him  she continued 
4308,there are heaps of things in him  more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me  he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this   she waved her hand at the landscape  which confirmed anything 
4309,if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years  you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut 
4310,there would be no trains  no ships to carry us literary people about in  no fields even 
4311,just savagery 
4312,no  perhaps not even that  without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm  more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it  there are times when it seems to me  
4313,and to me  and to all women 
4314,so one kissed paul 
4315,that s brutal  said margaret 
4316,mine is an absolutely different case 
4317,i ve thought things out 
4318,it makes no difference thinking things out 
4319,they come to the same 
4320,rubbish 
4321,there was a long silence  during which the tide returned into poole harbour 
4322,one would lose something  murmured helen  apparently to herself 
4323,the water crept over the mud flats towards the gorse and the blackened heather 
4324,branksea island lost its immense foreshores  and became a sombre episode of trees 
4325,frome was forced inward towards dorchester  stour against wimborne  avon towards salisbury  and over the immense displacement the sun presided  leading it to triumph ere he sank to rest 
4326,england was alive  throbbing through all her estuaries  crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls  and the north wind  with contrary motion  blew stronger against her rising seas 
4327,what did it mean 
4328,for what end are her fair complexities  her changes of soil  her sinuous coast 
4329,does she belong to those who have moulded her and made her feared by other lands  or to those who have added nothing to her power  but have somehow seen her  seen the whole island at once  lying as a jewel in a silver sea  sailing as a ship of souls  with all the brave world s fleet accompanying her towards eternity 
4330,margaret had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the world s waters  when love  who seems so tiny a pebble  slips in 
4331,whom does love concern beyond the beloved and the lover 
4332,yet his impact deluges a hundred shores 
4333,no doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations  welcoming the new generation  and chafing against the ultimate fate  who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand 
4334,but love cannot understand this 
4335,he cannot comprehend another s infinity  he is conscious only of his own  flying sunbeam  falling rose  pebble that asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and time  he knows that he will survive at the end of things  and be gathered by fate as a jewel from the slime  and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods  men did produce this they will say  and  saying  they will give men immortality  but meanwhile  what agitations meanwhile 
4336,the foundations of property and propriety are laid bare  twin rocks  family pride flounders to the surface  puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted  theology  vaguely ascetic  gets up a nasty ground swell 
4337,then the lawyers are aroused  cold brood  and creep out of their holes 
4338,they do what they can  they tidy up property and propriety  reassure theology and family pride 
4339,half guineas are poured on the troubled waters  the lawyers creep back  and  if all has gone well  love joins one man and woman together in matrimony 
4340,margaret had expected the disturbance  and was not irritated by it 
4341,for a sensitive woman she had steady nerves  and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque  and  besides  there was nothing excessive about her love affair 
4342,good humour was the dominant note of her relations with mr  wilcox  or  as i must now call him  henry 
4343,henry did not encourage romance  and she was no girl to fidget for it 
4344,an acquaintance had become a lover  might become a husband  but would retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance  and love must confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one 
4345,in this spirit she promised to marry him 
4346,he was in swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring 
4347,they greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed aunt juley 
4348,henry dined at the bays  but had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel  he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by instinct 
4349,after dinner he asked margaret if she wouldn t care for a turn on the parade 
4350,she accepted  and could not repress a little tremor  it would be her first real love scene 
4351,but as she put on her hat she burst out laughing 
4352,love was so unlike the article served up in books  the joy  though genuine was different  the mystery an unexpected mystery 
4353,for one thing  mr  wilcox still seemed a stranger 
4354,for a time they talked about the ring  then she said  do you remember the embankment at chelsea 
4355,it can t be ten days ago 
4356,yes  he said  laughing 
4357,and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme 
4358,ah well 
4359,i little thought then  certainly 
4360,did you 
4361,i don t know about that  i shouldn t like to say 
4362,why  was it earlier 
4363,she cried 
4364,did you think of me this way earlier 
4365,how extraordinarily interesting  henry 
4366,tell me 
4367,but henry had no intention of telling 
4368,perhaps he could not have told  for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them 
4369,he misliked the very word interesting  connoting it with wasted energy and even with morbidity 
4370,hard facts were enough for him 
4371,i didn t think of it  she pursued 
4372,no  when you spoke to me in the drawing room  that was practically the first 
4373,it was all so different from what it s supposed to be 
4374,on the stage  or in books  a proposal is  how shall i put it   a full blown affair  a kind of bouquet  it loses its literal meaning 
4375,but in life a proposal really is a proposal  
4376,by the way  
4377,  a suggestion  a seed  she concluded  and the thought flew away into darkness 
4378,i was thinking  if you didn t mind  that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk  there will be so much to settle 
4379,i think so too 
4380,tell me  in the first place  how did you get on with tibby 
4381,with your brother 
4382,yes  during cigarettes 
4383,oh  very well 
4384,i am so glad  she answered  a little surprised 
4385,what did you talk about 
4386,me  presumably 
4387,about greece too 
4388,greece was a very good card  henry 
4389,tibby s only a boy still  and one has to pick and choose subjects a little 
4390,well done 
4391,i was telling him i have shares in a currant farm near calamata 
4392,what a delightful thing to have shares in 
4393,can t we go there for our honeymoon 
4394,what to do 
4395,to eat the currants 
4396,and isn t there marvellous scenery 
4397,moderately  but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady 
4398,why not 
4399,no hotels 
4400,some ladies do without hotels 
4401,are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines  with our luggage on our backs 
4402,i wasn t aware  and  if i can manage it  you will never do such a thing again 
4403,she said more gravely  you haven t found time for a talk with helen yet  i suppose 
4404,do  before you go 
4405,i am so anxious you two should be friends 
4406,your sister and i have always hit it off  he said negligently 
4407,but we re drifting away from our business 
4408,let me begin at the beginning 
4409,you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill 
4410,dolly s uncle 
4411,exactly 
4412,the girl s madly in love with him 
4413,a very good sort of fellow  but he demands  and rightly  a suitable provision with her 
4414,and in the second place you will naturally understand  there is charles 
4415,before leaving town  i wrote charles a very careful letter 
4416,you see  he has an increasing family and increasing expenses  and the i  and w  a  is nothing particular just now  though capable of development 
4417,poor fellow  murmured margaret  looking out to sea  and not understanding 
4418,charles being the elder son  some day charles will have howards end  but i am anxious  in my own happiness  not to be unjust to others 
4419,of course not  she began  and then gave a little cry 
4420,you mean money 
4421,how stupid i am 
4422,of course not 
4423,oddly enough  he winced a little at the word 
4424,yes  money  since you put it so frankly 
4425,i am determined to be just to all  just to you  just to them 
4426,i am determined that my children shall have me 
4427,be generous to them  she said sharply 
4428,bother justice 
4429,i am determined  and have already written to charles to that effect  
4430,but how much have you got 
4431,what 
4432,how much have you a year 
4433,i ve six hundred 
4434,my income 
4435,yes 
4436,we must begin with how much you have  before we can settle how much you can give charles 
4437,justice  and even generosity  depend on that 
4438,i must say you re a downright young woman  he observed  patting her arm and laughing a little 
4439,what a question to spring on a fellow 
4440,don t you know your income 
4441,or don t you want to tell it me 
4442,that s all right   now she patted him   don t tell me  i don t want to know 
4443,i can do the sum just as well by proportion 
4444,divide your income into ten parts 
4445,how many parts would you give to evie  how many to charles  how many to paul 
4446,the fact is  my dear  i hadn t any intention of bothering you with details 
4447,i only wanted to let you know that  well  that something must be done for the others  and you ve understood me perfectly  so let s pass on to the next point 
4448,yes  we ve settled that  said margaret  undisturbed by his strategic blunderings 
4449,go ahead  give away all you can  bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred 
4450,what a mercy it is to have all this money about one 
4451,we ve none too much  i assure you  you re marrying a poor man 
4452,helen wouldn t agree with me here  she continued 
4453,helen daren t slang the rich  being rich herself  but she would like to 
4454,there s an odd notion  that i haven t yet got hold of  running about at the back of her brain  that poverty is somehow real 
4455,she dislikes all organisation  and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth 
4456,sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her  cheques do 
4457,helen is too relentless 
4458,one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world 
4459,there s this other point  and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters 
4460,what s to be done now about the house in ducie street 
4461,keep it on  at least  it depends 
4462,when do you want to marry me 
4463,she raised her voice  as too often  and some youths  who were also taking the evening air  overheard her 
4464,getting a bit hot  eh 
4465,said one 
4466,mr  wilcox turned on them  and said sharply  i say 
4467,there was silence 
4468,take care i don t report you to the police 
4469,they moved away quietly enough  but were only biding their time  and the rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter 
4470,lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it  he said  evie will probably be married in september 
4471,we could scarcely think of anything before then 
4472,the earlier the nicer  henry 
4473,females are not supposed to say such things  but the earlier the nicer 
4474,how about september for us too 
4475,he asked  rather dryly 
4476,right 
4477,shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september 
4478,or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it 
4479,that s rather an idea 
4480,they are so unbusinesslike  we could make them do anything by judicious management 
4481,look here  yes 
4482,we ll do that 
4483,and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire 
4484,he blew out his cheeks 
4485,heavens  how you women do fly round 
4486,my head s in a whirl 
4487,point by point  margaret 
4488,howards end s impossible 
4489,i let it to hamar bryce on a three years agreement last march 
4490,don t you remember 
4491,oniton 
4492,well  that is much  much too far away to rely on entirely 
4493,you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount  but we must have a house within easy reach of town 
4494,only ducie street has huge drawbacks 
4495,there s a mews behind 
4496,margaret could not help laughing 
4497,it was the first she had heard of the mews behind ducie street 
4498,when she was a possible tenant it had suppressed itself  not consciously  but automatically 
4499,the breezy wilcox manner  though genuine  lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative for truth 
4500,when henry lived in ducie street he remembered the mews  when he tried to let he forgot it  and if any one had remarked that the mews must be either there or not  he would have felt annoyed  and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatising the speaker as academic 
4501,so does my grocer stigmatise me when i complain of the quality of his sultanas  and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas  and how can i expect the best sultanas at that price 
4502,it is a flaw inherent in the business mind  and margaret may do well to be tender to it  considering all that the business mind has done for england 
4503,yes  in summer especially  the mews is a serious nuisance 
4504,the smoking room  too  is an abominable little den 
4505,the house opposite has been taken by operatic people 
4506,ducie street s going down  it s my private opinion 
4507,how sad 
4508,it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses 
4509,shows things are moving 
4510,good for trade 
4511,i hate this continual flux of london 
4512,it is an epitome of us at our worst  eternal formlessness  all the qualities  good  bad  and indifferent  streaming away  streaming  streaming for ever 
4513,that s why i dread it so 
4514,i mistrust rivers  even in scenery 
4515,now  the sea  
4516,high tide  yes 
4517,hoy toid   from the promenading youths 
4518,and these are the men to whom we give the vote  observed mr  wilcox  omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as clerks  work that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men 
4519,however  they have their own lives and interests 
4520,let s get on 
4521,he turned as he spoke  and prepared to see her back to the bays 
4522,the business was over 
4523,his hotel was in the opposite direction  and if he accompanied her his letters would be late for the post 
4524,she implored him not to come  but he was obdurate 
4525,a nice beginning  if your aunt saw you slip in alone 
4526,but i always do go about alone 
4527,considering i ve walked over the apennines  it s common sense 
4528,you will make me so angry 
4529,i don t the least take it as a compliment 
4530,he laughed  and lit a cigar 
4531,it isn t meant as a compliment  my dear 
4532,i just won t have you going about in the dark 
4533,such people about too 
4534,it s dangerous 
4535,can t i look after myself 
4536,i do wish  
4537,come along  margaret  no wheedling 
4538,a younger woman might have resented his masterly ways  but margaret had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss 
4539,she was  in her own way  as masterly 
4540,if he was a fortress she was a mountain peak  whom all might tread  but whom the snows made nightly virginal 
4541,disdaining the heroic outfit  excitable in her methods  garrulous  episodical  shrill  she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt 
4542,he mistook her fertility for weakness 
4543,he supposed her as clever as they make them  but no more  not realising that she was penetrating to the depths of his soul  and approving of what she found there 
4544,and if insight were sufficient  if the inner life were the whole of life  their happiness had been assured 
4545,they walked ahead briskly 
4546,the parade and the road after it were well lighted  but it was darker in aunt juley s garden 
4547,as they were going up by the side paths  through some rhododendrons  mr  wilcox  who was in front  said margaret rather huskily  turned  dropped his cigar  and took her in his arms 
4548,she was startled  and nearly screamed  but recovered herself at once  and kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own 
4549,it was their first kiss  and when it was over he saw her safely to the door and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the maid answered it 
4550,on looking back  the incident displeased her 
4551,it was so isolated 
4552,nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it  and  worse still  no tenderness had ensued 
4553,if a man cannot lead up to passion he can at all events lead down from it  and she had hoped  after her complaisance  for some interchange of gentle words 
4554,but he had hurried away as if ashamed  and for an instant she was reminded of helen and paul 
4555,charles had just been scolding his dolly 
4556,she deserved the scolding  and had bent before it  but her head  though bloody was unsubdued and her chirrupings began to mingle with his retreating thunder 
4557,you ve waked the baby 
4558,i knew you would 
4559, rum ti foo  rackety tackety tompkin  
4560,i m not responsible for what uncle percy does  nor for anybody else or anything  so there 
4561,who asked him while i was away 
4562,who asked my sister down to meet him 
4563,who sent them out in the motor day after day 
4564,charles  that reminds me of some poem 
4565,does it indeed 
4566,we shall all be dancing to a very different music presently 
4567,miss schlegel has fairly got us on toast 
4568,i could simply scratch that woman s eyes out  and to say it s my fault is most unfair 
4569,it s your fault  and five months ago you admitted it 
4570,i didn t 
4571,you did 
4572,tootle  tootle  playing on the pootle  exclaimed dolly  suddenly devoting herself to the child 
4573,it s all very well to turn the conversation  but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable 
4574,but you must needs start match making 
4575,besides  cahill s too old 
4576,of course  if you re going to be rude to uncle percy 
4577,miss schlegel always meant to get hold of howards end  and  thanks to you  she s got it 
4578,i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair 
4579,you couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting 
4580,could he  diddums 
4581,we re in a bad hole  and must make the best of it 
4582,i shall answer the pater s letter civilly 
4583,he s evidently anxious to do the decent thing 
4584,but i do not intend to forget these schlegels in a hurry 
4585,as long as they re on their best behaviour  dolly  are you listening   we ll behave  too 
4586,but if i find them giving themselves airs or monopolising my father  or at all ill treating him  or worrying him with their artistic beastliness  i intend to put my foot down  yes  firmly 
4587,taking my mother s place 
4588,heaven knows what poor old paul will say when the news reaches him 
4589,the interlude closes 
4590,it has taken place in charles s garden at hilton 
4591,he and dolly are sitting in deckchairs  and their motor is regarding them placidly from its garage across the lawn 
4592,a short frocked edition of charles also regards them placidly  a perambulator edition is squeaking  a third edition is expected shortly 
4593,nature is turning out wilcoxes in this peaceful abode  so that they may inherit the earth 
4594,margaret greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow 
4595,mature as he was  she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion 
4596,without it we are meaningless fragments  half monks  half beasts  unconnected arches that have never joined into a man 
4597,with it love is born  and alights on the highest curve  glowing against the grey  sober against the fire 
4598,happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of these outspread wings 
4599,the roads of his soul lie clear  and he and his friends shall find easy going 
4600,it was hard going in the roads of mr  wilcox s soul 
4601,from boyhood he had neglected them 
4602,i am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside 
4603,outwardly he was cheerful  reliable  and brave  but within  all had reverted to chaos  ruled  so far as it was ruled at all  by an incomplete asceticism 
4604,whether as boy  husband  or widower  he had always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad  a belief that is desirable only when held passionately 
4605,religion had confirmed him 
4606,the words that were read aloud on sunday to him and to other respectable men were the words that had once kindled the souls of st  catherine and st  francis into a white hot hatred of the carnal 
4607,he could not be as the saints and love the infinite with a seraphic ardour  but he could be a little ashamed of loving a wife 
4608,amabat  amare timebat 
4609,and it was here that margaret hoped to help him 
4610,it did not seem so difficult 
4611,she need trouble him with no gift of her own 
4612,she would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul  and in the soul of every man 
4613,only connect 
4614,that was the whole of her sermon 
4615,only connect the prose and the passion  and both will be exalted  and human love will be seen at its height 
4616,live in fragments no longer 
4617,only connect and the beast and the monk  robbed of the isolation that is life to either  will die 
4618,nor was the message difficult to give 
4619,it need not take the form of a good talking 
4620,by quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty 
4621,but she failed 
4622,for there was one quality in henry for which she was never prepared  however much she reminded herself of it  his obtuseness 
4623,he simply did not notice things  and there was no more to be said 
4624,he never noticed that helen and frieda were hostile  or that tibby was not interested in currant plantations  he never noticed the lights and shades that exist in the greyest conversation  the finger posts  the milestones  the collisions  the illimitable views 
4625,once  on another occasion  she scolded him about it 
4626,he was puzzled  but replied with a laugh  my motto is concentrate 
4627,i ve no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing 
4628,it isn t frittering away the strength  she protested 
4629,it s enlarging the space in which you may be strong 
4630,he answered  you re a clever little woman  but my motto s concentrate 
4631,and this morning he concentrated with a vengeance 
4632,they met in the rhododendrons of yesterday 
4633,in the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun 
4634,she was with helen  who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled 
4635,here we all are  she cried  and took him by one hand  retaining her sister s in the other 
4636,here we are 
4637,good morning  helen 
4638,helen replied  good morning  mr  wilcox 
4639,henry  she has had such a nice letter from the queer  cross boy 
4640,do you remember him 
4641,he had a sad moustache  but the back of his head was young 
4642,i have had a letter too 
4643,not a nice one  i want to talk it over with you   for leonard bast was nothing to him now that she had given him her word  the triangle of sex was broken for ever 
4644,thanks to your hint  he s clearing out of the porphyrion 
4645,not a bad business that porphyrion  he said absently  as he took his own letter out of his pocket 
4646,not a bad   she exclaimed  dropping his hand  surely  on chelsea embankment  
4647,here s our hostess 
4648,good morning  mrs  munt 
4649,fine rhododendrons 
4650,good morning  frau liesecke  we manage to grow flowers in england  don t we 
4651,not a bad business 
4652,my letter s about howards end 
4653,bryce has been ordered abroad  and wants to sublet it  i am far from sure that i shall give him permission 
4654,there was no clause in the agreement 
4655,in my opinion  subletting is a mistake 
4656,if he can find me another tenant  whom i consider suitable  i may cancel the agreement 
4657,morning  schlegel 
4658,don t you think that s better than subletting 
4659,helen had dropped her hand now  and he had steered her past the whole party to the seaward side of the house 
4660,beneath them was the bourgeois little bay  which must have yearned all through the centuries for just such a watering place as swanage to be built on its margin 
4661,the waves were colourless  and the bournemouth steamer gave a further touch of insipidity  drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for excursionists 
4662,when there is a sublet i find that damage  
4663,do excuse me  but about the porphyrion 
4664,i don t feel easy  might i just bother you  henry 
4665,her manner was so serious that he stopped  and asked her a little sharply what she wanted 
4666,you said on chelsea embankment  surely  that it was a bad concern  so we advised this clerk to clear out 
4667,he writes this morning that he s taken our advice  and now you say it s not a bad concern 
4668,a clerk who clears out of any concern  good or bad  without securing a berth somewhere else first  is a fool  and i ve no pity for him 
4669,he has not done that 
4670,he s going into a bank in camden town  he says 
4671,the salary s much lower  but he hopes to manage  a branch of dempster s bank 
4672,is that all right 
4673,dempster 
4674,why goodness me  yes 
4675,more right than the porphyrion 
4676,yes  yes  yes  safe as houses  safer 
4677,very many thanks 
4678,i m sorry  if you sublet   
4679,if he sublets  i shan t have the same control 
4680,in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end  in practice there will be 
4681,things may be done for which no money can compensate 
4682,for instance  i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt 
4683,it hangs  margaret  we must go and see the old place some time 
4684,it s pretty in its way 
4685,we ll motor down and have lunch with charles 
4686,i should enjoy that  said margaret bravely 
4687,what about next wednesday 
4688,wednesday 
4689,no  i couldn t well do that 
4690,aunt juley expects us to stop here another week at least 
4691,but you can give that up now 
4692,er  no  said margaret  after a moment s thought 
4693,oh  that ll be all right 
4694,i ll speak to her 
4695,this visit is a high solemnity 
4696,my aunt counts on it year after year 
4697,she turns the house upside down for us  she invites our special friends  she scarcely knows frieda  and we can t leave her on her hands 
4698,i missed one day  and she would be so hurt if i didn t stay the full ten 
4699,but i ll say a word to her 
4700,don t you bother 
4701,henry  i won t go 
4702,don t bully me 
4703,you want to see the house  though 
4704,very much  i ve heard so much about it  one way or the other 
4705,aren t there pigs teeth in the wych elm 
4706,pigs teeth 
4707,and you chew the bark for toothache 
4708,what a rum notion 
4709,of course not 
4710,perhaps i have confused it with some other tree 
4711,there are still a great number of sacred trees in england  it seems 
4712,but he left her to intercept mrs  munt  whose voice could be heard in the distance  to be intercepted himself by helen 
4713,mr  wilcox  about the porphyrion   she began and went scarlet all over her face 
4714,it s all right  called margaret  catching them up 
4715,dempster s bank s better 
4716,but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad  and would smash before christmas 
4717,did i 
4718,it was still outside the tariff ring  and had to take rotten policies 
4719,lately it came in  safe as houses now 
4720,in other words  mr  bast need never have left it 
4721,no  the fellow needn t 
4722,  and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary 
4723,he only says reduced  corrected margaret  seeing trouble ahead 
4724,with a man so poor  every reduction must be great 
4725,i consider it a deplorable misfortune 
4726,mr  wilcox  intent on his business with mrs  munt  was going steadily on  but the last remark made him say  what 
4727,what s that 
4728,do you mean that i m responsible 
4729,you re ridiculous  helen 
4730,you seem to think   he looked at his watch  let me explain the point to you  it is like this  you seem to assume  when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation  it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage  the porphyrion  according to you  was bound to say  i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring  i am not sure that i shall succeed  but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency  and i am trying  my dear helen  
4731,is that your point 
4732,a man who had little money has less  that s mine 
4733,i am grieved for your clerk 
4734,but it is all in the day s work 
4735,it s part of the battle of life 
4736,a man who had little money   she repeated  has less  owing to us 
4737,under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression 
4738,oh come  come  he protested pleasantly  you re not to blame 
4739,no one s to blame 
4740,is no one to blame for anything 
4741,i wouldn t say that  but you re taking it far too seriously 
4742,who is this fellow 
4743,we have told you about the fellow twice already  said helen 
4744,you have even met the fellow 
4745,he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile 
4746,he is capable of better things 
4747,we  we  the upper classes  thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge  and here s the result 
4748,he raised his finger 
4749,now  a word of advice 
4750,i require no more advice 
4751,a word of advice 
4752,don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor 
4753,see that she doesn t  margaret 
4754,the poor are poor  and one s sorry for them  but there it is 
4755,as civilisation moves forward  the shoe is bound to pinch in places  and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally 
4756,neither you  nor i  nor my informant  nor the man who informed him  nor the directors of the porphyrion  are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary 
4757,it s just the shoe pinching  no one can help it  and it might easily have been worse 
4758,helen quivered with indignation 
4759,by all means subscribe to charities  subscribe to them largely  but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform 
4760,i see a good deal behind the scenes  and you can take it from me that there is no social question  except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase  there are just rich and poor  as there always have been and always will be  point me out a time when men have been equal  
4761,i didn t say  
4762,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier 
4763,no  no 
4764,you can t 
4765,there always have been rich and poor 
4766,i m no fatalist 
4767,heaven forbid 
4768,but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces  his voice grew complacent  it always did when he eliminated the personal   and there always will be rich and poor 
4769,you can t deny it  and now it was a respectful voice    and you can t deny that  in spite of all  the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward 
4770,owing to god  i suppose  flashed helen 
4771,he stared at her 
4772,you grab the dollars 
4773,god does the rest 
4774,it was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about god in that neurotic modern way 
4775,fraternal to the last  he left her for the quieter company of mrs  munt 
4776,he thought  she rather reminds me of dolly 
4777,helen looked out at the sea 
4778,don t ever discuss political economy with henry  advised her sister 
4779,it ll only end in a cry 
4780,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion  said helen slowly 
4781,i don t like those men 
4782,they are scientific themselves  and talk of the survival of the fittest  and cut down the salaries of their clerks  and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort  but yet they believe that somehow good  it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome  and that in some mystical way the mr  basts of the future will benefit because the mr  brits of today are in pain 
4783,he is such a man in theory 
4784,but oh  helen  in theory 
4785,but oh  meg  what a theory 
4786,why should you put things so bitterly  dearie 
4787,because i m an old maid  said helen  biting her lip 
4788,i can t think why i go on like this myself 
4789,she shook off her sister s hand and went into the house 
4790,margaret  distressed at the day s beginning  followed the bournemouth steamer with her eyes 
4791,she saw that helen s nerves were exasperated by the unlucky bast business beyond the bounds of politeness 
4792,there might at any minute be a real explosion  which even henry would notice 
4793,henry must be removed 
4794,margaret  her aunt called 
4795,magsy 
4796,it isn t true  surely  what mr  wilcox says  that you want to go away early next week 
4797,not want  was margaret s prompt reply  but there is so much to be settled  and i do want to see the charles s 
4798,but going away without taking the weymouth trip  or even the lulworth 
4799,said mrs  munt  coming nearer 
4800,without going once more up nine barrows down 
4801,i m afraid so 
4802,mr  wilcox rejoined her with  good 
4803,i did the breaking of the ice 
4804,a wave of tenderness came over her 
4805,she put a hand on either shoulder  and looked deeply into the black  bright eyes 
4806,what was behind their competent stare 
4807,she knew  but was not disquieted 
4808,margaret had no intention of letting things slide  and the evening before she left swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding 
4809,she censured her  not for disapproving of the engagement  but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of mystery 
4810,helen was equally frank 
4811,yes  she said  with the air of one looking inwards  there is a mystery 
4812,i can t help it 
4813,it s not my fault 
4814,it s the way life has been made 
4815,helen in those days was over interested in the subconscious self 
4816,she exaggerated the punch and judy aspect of life  and spoke of mankind as puppets  whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war 
4817,margaret pointed out that if she dwelt on this she  too  would eliminate the personal 
4818,helen was silent for a minute  and then burst into a queer speech  which cleared the air 
4819,go on and marry him 
4820,i think you re splendid  and if any one can pull it off  you will 
4821,margaret denied that there was anything to pull off  but she continued  yes  there is  and i wasn t up to it with paul 
4822,i can do only what s easy 
4823,i can only entice and be enticed 
4824,i can t  and won t  attempt difficult relations 
4825,if i marry  it will either be a man who s strong enough to boss me or whom i m strong enough to boss 
4826,so i shan t ever marry  for there aren t such men 
4827,and heaven help any one whom i do marry  for i shall certainly run away from him before you can say jack robinson 
4828,there 
4829,because i m uneducated 
4830,but you  you re different  you re a heroine 
4831,oh  helen 
4832,am i 
4833,will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that 
4834,you mean to keep proportion  and that s heroic  it s greek  and i don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you 
4835,go on and fight with him and help him 
4836,don t ask me for help  or even for sympathy 
4837,henceforward i m going my own way 
4838,i mean to be thorough  because thoroughness is easy 
4839,i mean to dislike your husband  and to tell him so 
4840,i mean to make no concessions to tibby 
4841,if tibby wants to live with me  he must lump me  i mean to love you more than ever 
4842,yes  i do 
4843,you and i have built up something real  because it is purely spiritual 
4844,there s no veil of mystery over us 
4845,unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body 
4846,the popular view is  as usual  exactly the wrong one 
4847,our bothers are over tangible things  money  husbands  house hunting 
4848,but heaven will work of itself 
4849,margaret was grateful for this expression of affection  and answered  perhaps 
4850,all vistas close in the unseen  no one doubts it  but helen closed them rather too quickly for her taste 
4851,at every turn of speech one was confronted with reality and the absolute 
4852,perhaps margaret grew too old for metaphysics  perhaps henry was weaning her from them  but she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that so readily shreds the visible 
4853,the business man who assumes that this life is everything  and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing  fail  on this side and on that  to hit the truth 
4854,yes  i see  dear  it s about half way between  aunt juley had hazarded in earlier years 
4855,no  truth  being alive  was not half way between anything 
4856,it was only to be found by continuous excursions into either realm  and though proportion is the final secret  to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility 
4857,helen  agreeing here  disagreeing there  would have talked till midnight  but margaret  with her packing to do  focussed the conversation on henry 
4858,she might abuse henry behind his back  but please would she always be civil to him in company 
4859,i definitely dislike him  but i ll do what i can  promised helen 
4860,do what you can with my friends in return 
4861,this conversation made margaret easier 
4862,their inner life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been incredible to aunt juley  and impossible for tibby or charles 
4863,there are moments when the inner life actually pays  when years of self scrutiny  conducted for no ulterior motive  are suddenly of practical use 
4864,such moments are still rare in the west  that they come at all promises a fairer future 
4865,margaret  though unable to understand her sister  was assured against estrangement  and returned to london with a more peaceful mind 
4866,the following morning  at eleven o clock  she presented herself at the offices of the imperial and west african rubber company 
4867,she was glad to go there  for henry had implied his business rather than described it  and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with africa itself had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth 
4868,not that a visit to the office cleared things up 
4869,there was just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason  of electric light globes blossoming in triplets  of little rabbit hutches faced with glass or wire  of little rabbits 
4870,and even when she penetrated to the inner depths  she found only the ordinary table and turkey carpet  and though the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of west africa  it was a very ordinary map 
4871,another map hung opposite  on which the whole continent appeared  looking like a whale marked out for a blubber  and by its side was a door  shut  but henry s voice came through it  dictating a strong letter 
4872,she might have been at the porphyrion  or dempster s bank  or her own wine merchant s 
4873,everything seems just alike in these days 
4874,but perhaps she was seeing the imperial side of the company rather than its west african  and imperialism always had been one of her difficulties 
4875,one minute  called mr  wilcox on receiving her name 
4876,he touched a bell  the effect of which was to produce charles 
4877,charles had written his father an adequate letter  more adequate than evie s  through which a girlish indignation throbbed 
4878,and he greeted his future stepmother with propriety 
4879,i hope that my wife  how do you do   will give you a decent lunch  was his opening 
4880,i left instructions  but we live in a rough and ready way 
4881,she expects you back to tea  too  after you have had a look at howards end 
4882,i wonder what you ll think of the place 
4883,i wouldn t touch it with tongs myself 
4884,do sit down 
4885,it s a measly little place 
4886,i shall enjoy seeing it  said margaret  feeling  for the first time  shy 
4887,you ll see it at its worst  for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him 
4888,i never saw such a disgraceful mess 
4889,it s unbelievable 
4890,he wasn t in the house a month 
4891,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce  called henry from the inner chamber 
4892,why did he go so suddenly 
4893,invalid type  couldn t sleep 
4894,poor fellow 
4895,poor fiddlesticks  said mr  wilcox  joining them 
4896,he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave 
4897,charles flung them down 
4898,yes  i flung them down  said charles modestly 
4899,i ve sent a telegram after him  and a pretty sharp one  too 
4900,he  and he in person  is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years 
4901,the keys are at the farm  we wouldn t have the keys 
4902,quite right 
4903,dolly would have taken them  but i was in  fortunately 
4904,what s mr  bryce like 
4905,asked margaret 
4906,but nobody cared 
4907,mr  bryce was the tenant  who had no right to sublet  to have defined him further was a waste of time 
4908,on his misdeeds they descanted profusely  until the girl who had been typing the strong letter came out with it 
4909,mr  wilcox added his signature 
4910,now we ll be off  said he 
4911,a motor drive  a form of felicity detested by margaret  awaited her 
4912,charles saw them in  civil to the last  and in a moment the offices of the imperial and west african rubber company faded away 
4913,but it was not an impressive drive 
4914,perhaps the weather was to blame  being grey and banked high with weary clouds 
4915,perhaps hertfordshire is scarcely intended for motorists 
4916,did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through westmoreland that he missed it 
4917,and if westmoreland can be missed  it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye 
4918,hertfordshire is england at its quietest  with little emphasis of river and hill  it is england meditative 
4919,if drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem  he would sing the nymphs of hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature  with hair obfuscated by the london smoke 
4920,their eyes would be sad  and averted from their fate towards the northern flats  their leader not isis or sabrina  but the slowly flowing lea 
4921,no glory of raiment would be theirs  no urgency of dance  but they would be real nymphs 
4922,the chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped  for the great north road was full of easter traffic 
4923,but he went quite quick enough for margaret  a poor spirited creature  who had chickens and children on the brain 
4924,they re all right  said mr  wilcox 
4925,they ll learn  like the swallows and the telegraph wires 
4926,yes  but  while they re learning  
4927,the motor s come to stay  he answered 
4928,one must get about 
4929,there s a pretty church  oh  you aren t sharp enough  well  look out  if the road worries you  right outward at the scenery 
4930,she looked at the scenery 
4931,it heaved and merged like porridge 
4932,presently it congealed 
4933,they had arrived 
4934,charles s house on the left  on the right the swelling forms of the six hills 
4935,their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her 
4936,they interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards hilton 
4937,beyond them she saw meadows and a wood  and beneath them she settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried 
4938,she hated war and liked soldiers  it was one of her amiable inconsistencies 
4939,but here was dolly  dressed up to the nines  standing at the door to greet them  and here were the first drops of the rain 
4940,they ran in gaily  and after a long wait in the drawing room  sat down to the rough and ready lunch  every dish of which concealed or exuded cream 
4941,mr  bryce was the chief topic of conversation 
4942,dolly described his visit with the key  while her father in law gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all she said 
4943,it was evidently the custom to laugh at dolly 
4944,he chaffed margaret too  and margaret roused from a grave meditation was pleased and chaffed him back 
4945,dolly seemed surprised and eyed her curiously 
4946,after lunch the two children came down 
4947,margaret disliked babies  but hit it off better with the two year old  and sent dolly into fits of laughter by talking sense to him 
4948,kiss them now  and come away  said mr  wilcox 
4949,she came  but refused to kiss them  it was such hard luck on the little things  she said  and though dolly proffered chorly worly and porgly woggles in turn  she was obdurate 
4950,by this time it was raining steadily 
4951,the car came round with the hood up  and again she lost all sense of space 
4952,in a few minutes they stopped  and crane opened the door of the car 
4953,what s happened 
4954,asked margaret 
4955,what do you suppose 
4956,said henry 
4957,a little porch was close up against her face 
4958,are we there already 
4959,we are 
4960,well  i never 
4961,in years ago it seemed so far away 
4962,smiling  but somehow disillusioned  she jumped out  and her impetus carried her to the front door 
4963,she was about to open it  when henry said  that s no good  it s locked 
4964,who s got the key 
4965,as he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm  no one replied 
4966,he also wanted to know who had left the front gate open  since a cow had strayed in from the road  and was spoiling the croquet lawn 
4967,then he said rather crossly  margaret  you wait in the dry 
4968,i ll go down for the key 
4969,it isn t a hundred yards 
4970,mayn t i come too 
4971,no  i shall be back before i m gone 
4972,then the car turned away  and it was as if a curtain had risen 
4973,for the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth 
4974,there were the greengage trees that helen had once described  there the tennis lawn  there the hedge that would be glorious with dog roses in june  but the vision now was of black and palest green 
4975,down by the dell hole more vivid colours were awakening  and lent lilies stood sentinel on its margin  or advanced in battalions over the grass 
4976,tulips were a tray of jewels 
4977,she could not see the wych elm tree  but a branch of the celebrated vine  studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch 
4978,she was struck by the fertility of the soil  she had seldom been in a garden where the flowers looked so well  and even the weeds she was idly plucking out of the porch were intensely green 
4979,why had poor mr  bryce fled from all this beauty 
4980,for she had already decided that the place was beautiful 
4981,naughty cow 
4982,go away  cried margaret to the cow  but without indignation 
4983,harder came the rain  pouring out of a windless sky  and spattering up from the notice boards of the house agents  which lay in a row on the lawn where charles had hurled them 
4984,she must have interviewed charles in another world  where one did have interviews 
4985,how helen would revel in such a notion 
4986,charles dead  all people dead  nothing alive but houses and gardens 
4987,the obvious dead  the intangible alive  and no connection at all between them 
4988,margaret smiled 
4989,would that her own fancies were as clear cut 
4990,would that she could deal as high handedly with the world 
4991,smiling and sighing  she laid her hand upon the door 
4992,it opened 
4993,the house was not locked up at all 
4994,she hesitated 
4995,ought she to wait for henry 
4996,he felt strongly about property  and might prefer to show her over himself 
4997,on the other hand  he had told her to keep in the dry  and the porch was beginning to drip 
4998,so she went in  and the draught from inside slammed the door behind 
4999,desolation greeted her 
5000,dirty finger prints were on the hall windows  flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards 
5001,the civilisation of luggage had been here for a month  and then decamped 
5002,dining room and drawing room  right and left  were guessed only by their wallpapers 
5003,they were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain 
5004,across the ceiling of each ran a great beam 
5005,the dining room and hall revealed theirs openly  but the drawing room s was match boarded  because the facts of life must be concealed from ladies 
5006,drawing room  dining room  and hall  how petty the names sounded 
5007,here were simply three rooms where children could play and friends shelter from the rain 
5008,yes  and they were beautiful 
5009,then she opened one of the doors opposite  there were two  and exchanged wall papers for whitewash 
5010,it was the servants part  though she scarcely realised that  just rooms again  where friends might shelter 
5011,the garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums 
5012,farther on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines 
5013,yes  the meadow was beautiful 
5014,penned in by the desolate weather  she recaptured the sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from her 
5015,she remembered again that ten square miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile  that a thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven 
5016,the phantom of bigness  which london encourages  was laid for ever when she paced from the hall at howards end to its kitchen and heard the rain run this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided it 
5017,now helen came to her mind  scrutinising half wessex from the ridge of the purbeck downs  and saying  you will have to lose something 
5018,she was not so sure 
5019,for instance she would double her kingdom by opening the door that concealed the stairs 
5020,now she thought of the map of africa  of empires  of her father  of the two supreme nations  streams of whose life warmed her blood  but  mingling  had cooled her brain 
5021,she paced back into the hall  and as she did so the house reverberated 
5022,is that you  henry 
5023,she called 
5024,there was no answer  but the house reverberated again 
5025,henry  have you got in 
5026,but it was the heart of the house beating  faintly at first  then loudly  martially 
5027,it dominated the rain 
5028,it is the starved imagination  not the well nourished  that is afraid 
5029,margaret flung open the door to the stairs 
5030,a noise as of drums seemed to deafen her 
5031,a woman  an old woman  was descending  with figure erect  with face impassive  with lips that parted and said dryly 
5032,well  i took you for ruth wilcox 
5033,margaret stammered  i  mrs  wilcox  i 
5034,in fancy  of course  in fancy 
5035,you had her way of walking 
5036,good day 
5037,and the old woman passed out into the rain 
5038,it gave her quite a turn  said mr  wilcox  when retailing the incident to dolly at tea time 
5039,none of you girls have any nerves  really 
5040,of course  a word from me put it all right  but silly old miss avery  she frightened you  didn t she  margaret 
5041,there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds 
5042,she might have said something  instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on 
5043,i passed her as i came in 
5044,enough to make the car shy 
5045,i believe miss avery goes in for being a character  some old maids do 
5046,he lit a cigarette 
5047,it is their last resource 
5048,heaven knows what she was doing in the place  but that s bryce s business  not mine 
5049,i wasn t as foolish as you suggest  said margaret she only startled me  for the house had been silent so long 
5050,did you take her for a spook 
5051,asked dolly  for whom spooks and going to church summarised the unseen 
5052,not exactly 
5053,she really did frighten you  said henry  who was far from discouraging timidity in females 
5054,poor margaret 
5055,and very naturally 
5056,uneducated classes are so stupid 
5057,is miss avery uneducated classes 
5058,margaret asked  and found herself looking at the decoration scheme of dolly s drawing room 
5059,she s just one of the crew at the farm 
5060,people like that always assume things 
5061,she assumed you d know who she was 
5062,she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby  and assumed that you d seen them as you came in  that you d lock up the house when you d done  and would bring them on down to her 
5063,and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm 
5064,lack of education makes people very casual 
5065,hilton was full of women like miss avery once 
5066,i shouldn t have disliked it  perhaps 
5067,or miss avery giving me a wedding present  said dolly 
5068,which was illogical but interesting 
5069,through dolly  margaret was destined to learn a good deal 
5070,but charles said i must try not to mind  because she had known his grandmother 
5071,as usual  you ve got the story wrong  my good dorothea 
5072,i meant great grandmother  the one who left mrs  wilcox the house 
5073,weren t both of them and miss avery friends when howards end  too  was a farm 
5074,her father in law blew out a shaft of smoke 
5075,his attitude to his dead wife was curious 
5076,he would allude to her  and hear her discussed  but never mentioned her by name 
5077,nor was he interested in the dim  bucolic past 
5078,dolly was  for the following reason 
5079,then hadn t mrs  wilcox a brother  or was it an uncle  anyhow  he popped the question  and miss avery  she said no  just imagine  if she d said yes  she would have been charles s aunt   oh  i say  that s rather good  charlie s aunt   i must chaff him about that this evening   and the man went out and was killed  yes  i m certain i ve got it right now  tom howard  he was the last of them 
5080,i believe so  said mr  wilcox negligently 
5081,i say 
5082,howards end  howards ended  cried dolly 
5083,i m rather on the spot this evening  eh 
5084,i wish you d ask whether crane s ended 
5085,oh  mr  wilcox  how can you 
5086,because  if he has had enough tea  we ought to go  dolly s a good little woman  he continued  but a little of her goes a long way 
5087,i couldn t live near her if you paid me 
5088,margaret smiled 
5089,though presenting a firm front to outsiders  no wilcox could live near  or near the possessions of  any other wilcox 
5090,they had the colonial spirit  and were always making for some spot where the white man might carry his burden unobserved 
5091,of course  howards end was impossible  so long as the younger couple were established in hilton 
5092,his objections to the house were plain as daylight now 
5093,crane had had enough tea  and was sent to the garage  where their car had been trickling muddy water over charles s 
5094,the downpour had surely penetrated the six hills by now  bringing news of our restless civilisation 
5095,curious mounds  said henry  but in with you now  another time 
5096,he had to be up in london by seven  if possible  by six thirty 
5097,once more she lost the sense of space  once more trees  houses  people  animals  hills  merged and heaved into one dirtiness  and she was at wickham place 
5098,her evening was pleasant 
5099,the sense of flux which had haunted her all the year disappeared for a time 
5100,she forgot the luggage and the motor cars  and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little 
5101,she recaptured the sense of space  which is the basis of all earthly beauty  and  starting from howards end  she attempted to realise england 
5102,she failed  visions do not come when we try  though they may come through trying 
5103,but an unexpected love of the island awoke in her  connecting on this side with the joys of the flesh  on that with the inconceivable 
5104,helen and her father had known this love  poor leonard bast was groping after it  but it had been hidden from margaret till this afternoon 
5105,it had certainly come through the house and old miss avery 
5106,through them  the notion of through persisted  her mind trembled towards a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words 
5107,then  veering back into warmth  it dwelt on ruddy bricks  flowering plum trees  and all the tangible joys of spring 
5108,henry  after allaying her agitation  had taken her over his property  and had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms 
5109,he had sketched the history of the little estate 
5110,it is so unlucky  ran the monologue  that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago 
5111,then it had four  five  times the land  thirty acres at least  one could have made something out of it then  a small park  or at all events shrubberies  and rebuilt the house farther away from the road 
5112,what s the good of taking it in hand now 
5113,nothing but the meadow left  and even that was heavily mortgaged when i first had to do with things  yes  and the house too  oh  it was no joke  she saw two women as he spoke  one old  the other young  watching their inheritance melt away  she saw them greet him as a deliverer  mismanagement did it  besides  the days for small farms are over 
5114,it doesn t pay  except with intensive cultivation  small holdings  back to the land  ah  philanthropic bunkum 
5115,take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale 
5116,most of the land you see  they were standing at an upper window  the only one which faced west  belongs to the people at the park  they made their pile over copper  good chaps 
5117,avery s farm  sishe s  what they call the common  where you see that ruined oak  one after the other fell in  and so did this  as near as is no matter 
5118,but henry had saved it as near as is no matter without fine feelings or deep insight  but he had saved it  and she loved him for the deed 
5119,when i had more control i did what i could  sold off the two and a half animals  and the mangy pony  and the superannuated tools  pulled down the outhouses  drained  thinned out i don t know how many guelder roses and elder trees  and inside the house i turned the old kitchen into a hall  and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was 
5120,garage and so on came later 
5121,but one could still tell it s been an old farm 
5122,and yet it isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew 
5123,no  it wasn t  and if he did not quite understand it  the artistic crew would still less  it was english  and the wych elm that she saw from the window was an english tree 
5124,no report had prepared her for its peculiar glory 
5125,it was neither warrior  nor lover  nor god  in none of these roles do the english excel 
5126,it was a comrade bending over the house  strength and adventure in its roots  but in its utmost fingers tenderness  and the girth  that a dozen men could not have spanned  became in the end evanescent  till pale bud clusters seemed to float in the air 
5127,it was a comrade 
5128,house and tree transcended any similes of sex 
5129,margaret thought of them now  and was to think of them through many a windy night and london day  but to compare either to man  to woman  always dwarfed the vision 
5130,yet they kept within limits of the human 
5131,their message was not of eternity  but of hope on this side of the grave 
5132,as she stood in the one  gazing at the other  truer relationship had gleamed 
5133,another touch  and the account of her day is finished 
5134,they entered the garden for a minute  and to mr  wilcox s surprise she was right 
5135,teeth  pigs teeth  could be seen in the bark of the wych elm tree  just the white tips of them showing 
5136,extraordinary  he cried 
5137,who told you 
5138,i heard of it one winter in london  was her answer  for she  too  avoided mentioning mrs  wilcox by name 
5139,evie heard of her father s engagement when she was in for a tennis tournament  and her play went simply to pot 
5140,that she should marry and leave him had seemed natural enough  that he  left alone  should do the same was deceitful  and now charles and dolly said that it was all her fault 
5141,but i never dreamt of such a thing  she grumbled 
5142,dad took me to call now and then  and made me ask her to simpson s 
5143,well  i m altogether off dad 
5144,it was also an insult to their mother s memory  there they were agreed  and evie had the idea of returning mrs  wilcox s lace and jewellery as a protest 
5145,against what it would protest she was not clear  but being only eighteen  the idea of renunciation appealed to her  the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace 
5146,dolly then suggested that she and uncle percy should pretend to break off their engagement  and then perhaps mr  wilcox would quarrel with miss schlegel  and break off his  or paul might be cabled for 
5147,but at this point charles told them not to talk nonsense 
5148,so evie settled to marry as soon as possible  it was no good hanging about with these schlegels eyeing her 
5149,the date of her wedding was consequently put forward from september to august  and in the intoxication of presents she recovered much of her good humour 
5150,margaret found that she was expected to figure at this function  and to figure largely  it would be such an opportunity  said henry  for her to get to know his set 
5151,sir james bidder would be there  and all the cahills and the fussells  and his sister in law  mrs  warrington wilcox  had fortunately got back from her tour round the world 
5152,henry she loved  but his set promised to be another matter 
5153,he had not the knack of surrounding himself with nice people  indeed  for a man of ability and virtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate  he had no guiding principle beyond a certain preference for mediocrity  he was content to settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard  and so  while his investments went right  his friends generally went wrong 
5154,she would be told  oh  so and so s a good sort  a thundering good sort  and find  on meeting him  that he was a brute or a bore 
5155,if henry had shown real affection  she would have understood  for affection explains everything 
5156,but he seemed without sentiment 
5157,the thundering good sort might at any moment become a fellow for whom i never did have much use  and have less now  and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion 
5158,margaret had done the same as a schoolgirl 
5159,now she never forgot any one for whom she had once cared  she connected  though the connection might be bitter  and she hoped that some day henry would do the same 
5160,evie was not to be married from ducie street 
5161,she had a fancy for something rural  and  besides  no one would be in london then  so she left her boxes for a few weeks at oniton grange  and her banns were duly published in the parish church  and for a couple of days the little town  dreaming between the ruddy hills  was roused by the clang of our civilisation  and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass 
5162,oniton had been a discovery of mr  wilcox s  a discovery of which he was not altogether proud 
5163,it was up towards the welsh border  and so difficult of access that he had concluded it must be something special 
5164,a ruined castle stood in the grounds 
5165,but having got there  what was one to do 
5166,the shooting was bad  the fishing indifferent  and womenfolk reported the scenery as nothing much 
5167,the place turned out to be in the wrong part of shropshire  and though he never ran down his own property to others  he was only waiting to get it off his hands  and then to let fly 
5168,evie s marriage was its last appearance in public 
5169,as soon as a tenant was found  it became a house for which he never had had much use  and had less now  and  like howards end  faded into limbo 
5170,but on margaret oniton was destined to make a lasting impression 
5171,she regarded it as her future home  and was anxious to start straight with the clergy  etc   and  if possible  to see something of the local life 
5172,it was a market town  as tiny a one as england possesses  and had for ages served that lonely valley  and guarded our marches against the celt 
5173,in spite of the occasion  in spite of the numbing hilarity that greeted her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at paddington  her senses were awake and watching  and though oniton was to prove one of her innumerable false starts  she never forgot it  or the things that happened there 
5174,the london party only numbered eight  the fussells  father and son  two anglo indian ladies named mrs  plynlimmon and lady edser  mrs  warrington wilcox and her daughter  and  lastly  the little girl  very smart and quiet  who figures at so many weddings  and who kept a watchful eye on margaret  the bride elect 
5175,dolly was absent  a domestic event detained her at hilton  paul had cabled a humorous message  charles was to meet them with a trio of motors at shrewsbury  helen had refused her invitation  tibby had never answered his  the management was excellent  as was to be expected with anything that henry undertook  one was conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the background  they were his guests as soon as they reached the train  a special label for their luggage  a courier  a special lunch  they had only to look pleasant and  where possible  pretty  margaret thought with dismay of her own nuptials  presumably under the management of tibby 
5176,mr  theobald schlegel and miss helen schlegel request the pleasure of mrs  plynlimmon s company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister margaret 
5177,the formula was incredible  but it must soon be printed and sent  and though wickham place need not compete with oniton  it must feed its guests properly  and provide them with sufficient chairs 
5178,her wedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeois  she hoped the latter 
5179,such an affair as the present  staged with a deftness that was almost beautiful  lay beyond her powers and those of her friends 
5180,the low rich purr of a great western express is not the worst background for conversation  and the journey passed pleasantly enough 
5181,nothing could have exceeded the kindness of the two men 
5182,they raised windows for some ladies  and lowered them for others  they rang the bell for the servant  they identified the colleges as the train slipped past oxford  they caught books or bag purses in the act of tumbling on to the floor 
5183,yet there was nothing finicking about their politeness  it had the public school touch  and  though sedulous  was virile 
5184,more battles than waterloo have been won on our playing fields  and margaret bowed to a charm of which she did not wholly approve  and said nothing when the oxford colleges were identified wrongly 
5185,male and female created he them   the journey to shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement  and the long glass saloon  that moved so easily and felt so comfortable  became a forcing house for the idea of sex 
5186,at shrewsbury came fresh air 
5187,margaret was all for sight seeing  and while the others were finishing their tea at the raven  she annexed a motor and hurried over the astonishing city 
5188,her chauffeur was not the faithful crane  but an italian  who dearly loved making her late 
5189,charles  watch in hand  though with a level brow  was standing in front of the hotel when they returned 
5190,it was perfectly all right  he told her  she was by no means the last 
5191,and then he dived into the coffee room  and she heard him say  for god s sake  hurry the women up  we shall never be off  and albert fussell reply  not i  i ve done my share  and colonel fussell opine that the ladies were getting themselves up to kill 
5192,presently myra  mrs  warrington s daughter  appeared  and as she was his cousin  charles blew her up a little  she had been changing her smart travelling hat for a smart motor hat 
5193,then mrs  warrington herself  leading the quiet child  the two anglo indian ladies were always last 
5194,maids  courier  heavy luggage  had already gone on by a branch line to a station nearer oniton  but there were five hat boxes and four dressing bags to be packed  and five dust cloaks to be put on  and to be put off at the last moment  because charles declared them not necessary 
5195,the men presided over everything with unfailing good humour 
5196,by half past five the party was ready  and went out of shrewsbury by the welsh bridge 
5197,shropshire had not the reticence of hertfordshire 
5198,though robbed of half its magic by swift movement  it still conveyed the sense of hills 
5199,they were nearing the buttresses that force the severn eastward and make it an english stream  and the sun  sinking over the sentinels of wales  was straight in their eyes 
5200,having picked up another guest  they turned southward  avoiding the greater mountains  but conscious of an occasional summit  rounded and mild  whose colouring differed in quality from that of the lower earth  and whose contours altered more slowly 
5201,quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons  the west  as ever  was retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery  but which no practical man will ever discover 
5202,they spoke of tariff reform 
5203,mrs  warrington was just back from the colonies 
5204,like many other critics of empire  her mouth had been stopped with food  and she could only exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received  and warn the mother country against trifling with young titans 
5205,they threaten to cut the painter  she cried  and where shall we be then 
5206,miss schlegel  you ll undertake to keep henry sound about tariff reform 
5207,it is our last hope 
5208,margaret playfully confessed herself on the other side  and they began to quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them deep into the hills 
5209,curious these were rather than impressive  for their outlines lacked beauty  and the pink fields on their summits suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry 
5210,an occasional outcrop of rock  an occasional wood  an occasional forest  treeless and brown  all hinted at wildness to follow  but the main colour was an agricultural green 
5211,the air grew cooler  they had surmounted the last gradient  and oniton lay below them with its church  its radiating houses  its castle  its river girt peninsula 
5212,close to the castle was a grey mansion unintellectual but kindly  stretching with its grounds across the peninsula s neck  the sort of mansion that was built all over england in the beginning of the last century  while architecture was still an expression of the national character  that was the grange  remarked albert  over his shoulder  and then he jammed the brake on  and the motor slowed down and stopped  i m sorry  said he  turning round  do you mind getting out  by the door on the right 
5213,steady on 
5214,what s happened 
5215,asked mrs  warrington 
5216,then the car behind them drew up  and the voice of charles was heard saying  get the women out at once 
5217,there was a concourse of males  and margaret and her companions were hustled out and received into the second car 
5218,what had happened 
5219,as it started off again  the door of a cottage opened  and a girl screamed wildly at them 
5220,what is it 
5221,the ladies cried 
5222,charles drove them a hundred yards without speaking 
5223,then he said  it s all right 
5224,your car just touched a dog 
5225,but stop  cried margaret  horrified 
5226,it didn t hurt him 
5227,didn t really hurt him 
5228,asked myra 
5229,do please stop  said margaret  leaning forward 
5230,she was standing up in the car  the other occupants holding her knees to steady her 
5231,i want to go back  please 
5232,charles took no notice 
5233,we ve left mr  fussell behind  said another  and angelo  and crane 
5234,yes  but no woman 
5235,i expect a little of   mrs  warrington scratched her palm   will be more to the point than one of us 
5236,the insurance company see to that  remarked charles  and albert will do the talking 
5237,i want to go back  though  i say  repeated margaret  getting angry 
5238,charles took no notice 
5239,the motor  loaded with refugees  continued to travel very slowly down the hill 
5240,the men are there  chorused the others 
5241,they will see to it 
5242,the men can t see to it 
5243,oh  this is ridiculous 
5244,charles  i ask you to stop 
5245,stopping s no good  drawled charles 
5246,isn t it 
5247,said margaret  and jumped straight out of the car 
5248,she fell on her knees  cut her gloves  shook her hat over her ear 
5249,cries of alarm followed her 
5250,you ve hurt yourself  exclaimed charles  jumping after her 
5251,of course i ve hurt myself  she retorted 
5252,may i ask what  
5253,there s nothing to ask  said margaret 
5254,your hand s bleeding 
5255,i know 
5256,i m in for a frightful row from the pater 
5257,you should have thought of that sooner  charles 
5258,charles had never been in such a position before 
5259,it was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him  and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger 
5260,he recovered himself when the others caught them up  their sort he understood 
5261,he commanded them to go back 
5262,albert fussell was seen walking towards them 
5263,it s all right  he called 
5264,it was a cat 
5265,there  exclaimed charles triumphantly 
5266,it s only a rotten cat 
5267,got room in your car for a little un 
5268,i cut as soon as i saw it wasn t a dog  the chauffeurs are tackling the girl 
5269,but margaret walked forward steadily 
5270,why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl 
5271,ladies sheltering behind men  men sheltering behind servants  the whole system s wrong  and she must challenge it 
5272,miss schlegel 
5273,pon my word  you ve hurt your hand 
5274,i m just going to see  said margaret 
5275,don t you wait  mr  fussell 
5276,the second motor came round the corner 
5277,it is all right  madam  said crane in his turn 
5278,he had taken to calling her madam 
5279,what s all right 
5280,the cat 
5281,yes  madam 
5282,the girl will receive compensation for it 
5283,she was a very ruda girla  said angelo from the third motor thoughtfully 
5284,wouldn t you have been rude 
5285,the italian spread out his hands  implying that he had not thought of rudeness  but would produce it if it pleased her 
5286,the situation became absurd 
5287,the gentlemen were again buzzing round miss schlegel with offers of assistance  and lady edser began to bind up her hand 
5288,she yielded  apologising slightly  and was led back to the car  and soon the landscape resumed its motion  the lonely cottage disappeared  the castle swelled on its cushion of turf  and they had arrived 
5289,no doubt she had disgraced herself 
5290,but she felt their whole journey from london had been unreal 
5291,they had no part with the earth and its emotions 
5292,they were dust  and a stink  and cosmopolitan chatter  and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they 
5293,oh  henry  she exclaimed  i have been so naughty  for she had decided to take up this line 
5294,we ran over a cat 
5295,charles told me not to jump out  but i would  and look 
5296,she held out her bandaged hand 
5297,your poor meg went such a flop 
5298,mr  wilcox looked bewildered 
5299,in evening dress  he was standing to welcome his guests in the hall 
5300,thinking it was a dog  added mrs  warrington 
5301,ah  a dog s a companion  said colonel fussell 
5302,a dog ll remember you 
5303,have you hurt yourself  margaret 
5304,not to speak about  and it s my left hand 
5305,well  hurry up and change 
5306,she obeyed  as did the others 
5307,mr  wilcox then turned to his son 
5308,now  charles  what s happened 
5309,charles was absolutely honest 
5310,he described what he believed to have happened 
5311,albert had flattened out a cat  and miss schlegel had lost her nerve  as any woman might 
5312,she had been got safely into the other car  but when it was in motion had leapt out again  in spite of all that they could say 
5313,after walking a little on the road  she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry 
5314,his father accepted this explanation  and neither knew that margaret had artfully prepared the way for it 
5315,it fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature 
5316,in the smoking room  after dinner  the colonel put forward the view that miss schlegel had jumped it out of devilry 
5317,well he remembered as a young man  in the harbour of gibraltar once  how a girl  a handsome girl  too  had jumped overboard for a bet 
5318,he could see her now  and all the lads overboard after her 
5319,but charles and mr  wilcox agreed it was much more probably nerves in miss schlegel s case 
5320,charles was depressed 
5321,that woman had a tongue 
5322,she would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them 
5323,he strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over 
5324,the evening was exquisite 
5325,on three sides of him a little river whispered  full of messages from the west  above his head the ruins made patterns against the sky 
5326,he carefully reviewed their dealings with this family  until he fitted helen  and margaret  and aunt juley into an orderly conspiracy 
5327,paternity had made him suspicious 
5328,he had two children to look after  and more coming  and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men 
5329,it is all very well  he reflected  the pater s saying that he will be just to all  but one can t be just indefinitely 
5330,money isn t elastic 
5331,what s to happen if evie has a family 
5332,and  come to that  so may the pater 
5333,there ll not be enough to go round  for there s none coming in  either through dolly or percy 
5334,it s damnable 
5335,he looked enviously at the grange  whose windows poured light and laughter 
5336,first and last  this wedding would cost a pretty penny 
5337,two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace  and as the syllables imperialism were wafted to his ears  he guessed that one of them was his aunt 
5338,she might have helped him  if she too had not had a family to provide for 
5339,every one for himself  he repeated  a maxim which had cheered him in the past  but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of oniton 
5340,he lacked his father s ability in business  and so had an ever higher regard for money  unless he could inherit plenty  he feared to leave his children poor 
5341,as he sat thinking  one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow  he recognised her as margaret by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm  and put out his cigar  lest the gleam should betray him 
5342,she climbed up the mound in zigzags  and at times stooped down  as if she was stroking the turf 
5343,it sounds absolutely incredible  but for a moment charles thought that she was in love with him  and had come out to tempt him 
5344,charles believed in temptresses  who are indeed the strong man s necessary complement  and having no sense of humour  he could not purge himself of the thought by a smile 
5345,margaret  who was engaged to his father  and his sister s wedding guest  kept on her way without noticing him  and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point 
5346,but what was she doing 
5347,why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs 
5348,as she edged round the keep  she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar smoke  for she exclaimed  hullo 
5349,who s that 
5350,charles made no answer 
5351,saxon or celt 
5352,she continued  laughing in the darkness 
5353,but it doesn t matter 
5354,whichever you are  you will have to listen to me  i love this place 
5355,i love shropshire 
5356,i hate london 
5357,i am glad that this will be my home 
5358,ah  dear   she was now moving back towards the house   what a comfort to have arrived 
5359,that woman means mischief  thought charles  and compressed his lips 
5360,in a few minutes he followed her indoors  as the ground was getting damp 
5361,mists were rising from the river  and presently it became invisible  though it whispered more loudly 
5362,there had been a heavy downpour in the welsh hills 
5363,next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula 
5364,the weather promised well  and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that margaret watched it 
5365,presently she saw the keep  and the sun painted the rubble gold  and charged the white sky with blue 
5366,the shadow of the house gathered itself together  and fell over the garden 
5367,a cat looked up at her window and mewed 
5368,lastly the river appeared  still holding the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders  and only visible as far as a hill  which cut off its upper reaches 
5369,margaret was fascinated by oniton 
5370,she had said that she loved it  but it was rather its romantic tension that held her 
5371,the rounded druids of whom she had caught glimpses in her drive  the rivers hurrying down from them to england  the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills  thrilled her with poetry 
5372,the house was insignificant  but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy  and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it  and of the conversion of henry himself to a rural life 
5373,society  too  promised favourably 
5374,the rector of the parish had dined with them last night  and she found that he was a friend of her father s  and so knew what to find in her 
5375,she liked him 
5376,he would introduce her to the town 
5377,while  on her other side  sir james bidder sat  repeating that she only had to give the word  and he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round 
5378,whether sir james  who was garden seeds  had promised what he could perform  she doubted  but so long as henry mistook them for the county families when they did call  she was content 
5379,charles wilcox and albert fussell now crossed the lawn 
5380,they were going for a morning dip  and a servant followed them with their bathing suits 
5381,she had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast  but saw that the day was still sacred to men  and amused herself by watching their contretemps 
5382,in the first place the key of the bathing she would could not be found 
5383,charles stood by the riverside with folded hands  tragical  while the servant shouted  and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden 
5384,then came a difficulty about a springboard  and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow  with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies 
5385,if margaret wanted to jump from a motor car  she jumped  if tibby thought paddling would benefit his ankles  he paddled  if a clerk desired adventure  he took a walk in the dark 
5386,but these athletes seemed paralysed 
5387,they could not bathe without their appliances  though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream 
5388,had they found the life of the body after all 
5389,could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat them  even on their own ground 
5390,she thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day  no worrying of servants  no appliances  beyond good sense 
5391,her reflections were disturbed by the quiet child  who had come out to speak to the cat  but was now watching her watch the men 
5392,she called  good morning  dear  a little sharply 
5393,her voice spread consternation 
5394,charles looked round  and though completely attired in indigo blue  vanished into the she would  and was seen no more 
5395,miss wilcox is up   the child whispered  and then became unintelligible 
5396,what is that 
5397,it sounded like    cut yoke  sack back  
5398,i can t hear 
5399,  on the bed  tissue paper  
5400,gathering that the wedding dress was on view  and that a visit would be seemly  she went to evie s room 
5401,all was hilarity here 
5402,evie  in a petticoat  was dancing with one of the anglo indian ladies  while the other was adoring yards of white satin 
5403,they screamed  they laughed  they sang  and the dog barked 
5404,margaret screamed a little too  but without conviction 
5405,she could not feel that a wedding was so funny 
5406,perhaps something was missing in her equipment 
5407,evie gasped  dolly is a rotter not to be here 
5408,oh  we would rag just then 
5409,then margaret went down to breakfast 
5410,henry was already installed  he ate slowly and spoke little  and was  in margaret s eyes  the only member of their party who dodged emotion successfully 
5411,she could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife 
5412,yet he dwelt intact  only issuing orders occasionally  orders that promoted the comfort of his guests  he inquired after her hand  he set her to pour out the coffee and mrs  warrington to pour out the tea  when evie came down there was a moment s awkwardness  and both ladies rose to vacate their places  burton  called henry  serve tea and coffee from the sideboard  it wasn t genuine tact  but it was tact  of a sort  the sort that is as useful as the genuine  and saves even more situations at board meetings 
5413,henry treated a marriage like a funeral  item by item  never raising his eyes to the whole  and death  where is thy sting 
5414,love  where is thy victory 
5415,one would exclaim at the close 
5416,after breakfast margaret claimed a few words with him 
5417,it was always best to approach him formally 
5418,she asked for the interview  because he was going on to shoot grouse to morrow  and she was returning to helen in town 
5419,certainly  dear  said he 
5420,of course  i have the time 
5421,what do you want 
5422,nothing 
5423,i was afraid something had gone wrong 
5424,no  i have nothing to say  but you may talk 
5425,glancing at his watch  he talked of the nasty curve at the lych gate 
5426,she heard him with interest 
5427,her surface could always respond to his without contempt  though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him 
5428,she had abandoned any plan of action 
5429,love is the best  and the more she let herself love him  the more chance was there that he would set his soul in order 
5430,such a moment as this  when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future home  was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to him 
5431,each lift of his eyes  each parting of the thatched lip from the clean shaven  must prelude the tenderness that kills the monk and the beast at a single blow 
5432,disappointed a hundred times  she still hoped 
5433,she loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness 
5434,whether he droned trivialities  as to day  or sprang kisses on her in the twilight  she could pardon him  she could respond 
5435,if there is this nasty curve  she suggested  couldn t we walk to the church 
5436,not  of course  you and evie  but the rest of us might very well go on first  and that would mean fewer carriages 
5437,one can t have ladies walking through the market square 
5438,the fussells wouldn t like it  they were awfully particular at charles s wedding 
5439,my  she  our party was anxious to walk  and certainly the church was just round the corner  and i shouldn t have minded  but the colonel made a great point of it 
5440,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous  said margaret thoughtfully 
5441,why not 
5442,she knew why not  but said that she did not know 
5443,he then announced that  unless she had anything special to say  he must visit the wine cellar  and they went off together in search of burton 
5444,though clumsy and a little inconvenient  oniton was a genuine country house 
5445,they clattered down flagged passages  looking into room after room  and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties 
5446,the wedding breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church  and tea would be served in the garden 
5447,the sight of so many agitated and serious people made margaret smile  but she reflected that they were paid to be serious  and enjoyed being agitated 
5448,here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing evie up into nuptial glory 
5449,a little boy blocked their way with pig pails 
5450,his mind could not grasp their greatness  and he said  by your leave  let me pass  please 
5451,henry asked him where burton was 
5452,but the servants were so new that they did not know one another s names 
5453,in the still room sat the band  who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee  and who were already drinking beer 
5454,scents of araby came from the kitchen  mingled with cries 
5455,margaret knew what had happened there  for it happened at wickham place 
5456,one of the wedding dishes had boiled over  and the cook was throwing cedar shavings to hide the smell 
5457,at last they came upon the butler 
5458,henry gave him the keys  and handed margaret down the cellar stairs 
5459,two doors were unlocked 
5460,she  who kept all her wine at the bottom of the linen cupboard  was astonished at the sight 
5461,we shall never get through it  she cried  and the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood  and exchanged smiles 
5462,she felt as if she had again jumped out of the car while it was moving 
5463,certainly oniton would take some digesting 
5464,it would be no small business to remain herself  and yet to assimilate such an establishment 
5465,she must remain herself  for his sake as well as her own  since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies  and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty  since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable 
5466,her only ally was the power of home 
5467,the loss of wickham place had taught her more than its possession 
5468,howards end had repeated the lesson 
5469,she was determined to create new sanctities among these hills 
5470,after visiting the wine cellar  she dressed  and then came the wedding  which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it 
5471,everything went like one o clock 
5472,mr  cahill materialised out of space  and was waiting for his bride at the church door 
5473,no one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses  or trod on evie s train  or cried 
5474,in a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty  the register was signed  and they were back in their carriages  negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych gate 
5475,margaret was convinced that they had not been married at all  and that the norman church had been intent all the time on other business 
5476,there were more documents to sign at the house  and the breakfast to eat  and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party 
5477,there had been a great many refusals  and after all it was not a very big affair  not as big as margaret s would be 
5478,she noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet  that outwardly she might give henry what was proper 
5479,but inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of sunday church and fox hunting 
5480,if only some one had been upset 
5481,but this wedding had gone off so particularly well   quite like a durbar in the opinion of lady edser  and she thoroughly agreed with her 
5482,so the wasted day lumbered forward  the bride and bridegroom drove off  yelling with laughter  and for the second time the sun retreated towards the hills of wales 
5483,henry  who was more tired than he owned  came up to her in the castle meadow  and  in tones of unusual softness  said that he was pleased 
5484,everything had gone off so well 
5485,she felt that he was praising her  too  and blushed  certainly she had done all she could with his intractable friends  and had made a special point of kotowing to the men 
5486,they were breaking camp this evening  only the warringtons and quiet child would stay the night  and the others were already moving towards the house to finish their packing 
5487,i think it did go off well  she agreed 
5488,since i had to jump out of the motor  i m thankful i lighted on my left hand 
5489,i am so very glad about it  henry dear  i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable 
5490,you must all remember that we have no practical person among us  except my aunt  and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale 
5491,i know  he said gravely 
5492,under the circumstances  it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s  or even to go to some hotel 
5493,you desire a hotel 
5494,yes  because  well  i mustn t interfere with you 
5495,no doubt you want to be married from your old home 
5496,my old home s falling into pieces  henry 
5497,i only want my new 
5498,isn t it a perfect evening  
5499,the alexandrina isn t bad  
5500,the alexandrina  she echoed  more occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys  and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey 
5501,it s off curzon street 
5502,is it 
5503,let s be married from off curzon street 
5504,then she turned westward  to gaze at the swirling gold 
5505,just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it 
5506,fairyland must lie above the bend  and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past charles s bathing she would 
5507,she gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled  and when they moved back to the house  she could not recognise the faces of people who were coming out of it 
5508,a parlour maid was preceding them 
5509,who are those people 
5510,she asked 
5511,they re callers  exclaimed henry 
5512,it s too late for callers 
5513,perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents 
5514,i m not at home yet to townees 
5515,well  hide among the ruins  and if i can stop them  i will 
5516,he thanked her 
5517,margaret went forward  smiling socially 
5518,she supposed that these were unpunctual guests  who would have to be content with vicarious civility  since evie and charles were gone  henry tired  and the others in their rooms 
5519,she assumed the airs of a hostess  not for long 
5520,for one of the group was helen  helen in her oldest clothes  and dominated by that tense  wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery days 
5521,what is it 
5522,she called 
5523,oh  what s wrong 
5524,is tibby ill 
5525,helen spoke to her two companions  who fell back 
5526,then she bore forward furiously 
5527,they re starving  she shouted 
5528,i found them starving 
5529,who 
5530,why have you come 
5531,the basts 
5532,oh  helen  moaned margaret 
5533,whatever have you done now 
5534,he has lost his place 
5535,he has been turned out of his bank 
5536,yes  he s done for 
5537,we upper classes have ruined him  and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life 
5538,starving 
5539,his wife is ill 
5540,starving 
5541,she fainted in the train 
5542,helen  are you mad 
5543,perhaps 
5544,yes 
5545,if you like  i m mad 
5546,but i ve brought them 
5547,i ll stand injustice no longer 
5548,i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury  this talk of impersonal forces  this cannot about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves 
5549,have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire  helen 
5550,helen was checked 
5551,she had not thought of this  and her hysteria abated 
5552,there was a restaurant car on the train  she said 
5553,don t be absurd 
5554,they aren t starving  and you know it 
5555,now  begin from the beginning 
5556,i won t have such theatrical nonsense 
5557,how dare you 
5558,yes  how dare you  she repeated  as anger filled her  bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way 
5559,my goodness  but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy 
5560,look   she indicated the house   servants  people out of the windows 
5561,they think it s some vulgar scandal  and i must explain  oh no  it s only my sister screaming  and only two hangers on of ours  whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason 
5562,kindly take back that word hangers on  said helen  ominously calm 
5563,very well  conceded margaret  who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel 
5564,i  too  am sorry about them  but it beats me why you ve brought them here  or why you re here yourself 
5565,it s our last chance of seeing mr  wilcox 
5566,margaret moved towards the house at this 
5567,she was determined not to worry henry 
5568,he s going to scotland 
5569,i know he is  i insist on seeing him 
5570,yes  to morrow 
5571,i knew it was our last chance 
5572,how do you do  mr  bast 
5573,said margaret  trying to control her voice 
5574,this is an odd business 
5575,what view do you take of it 
5576,there is mrs  bast  too  prompted helen 
5577,jacky also shook hands 
5578,she  like her husband  was shy  and  furthermore  ill  and furthermore  so bestially stupid that she could not grasp what was happening 
5579,she only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last night  had paid the rent  redeemed the furniture  provided them with a dinner and a breakfast  and ordered them to meet her at paddington next morning 
5580,leonard had feebly protested  and when the morning came  had suggested that they shouldn t go 
5581,but she  half mesmerised  had obeyed 
5582,the lady had told them to  and they must  and their bed sitting room had accordingly changed into paddington  and paddington into a railway carriage  that shook  and grew hot  and grew cold  and vanished entirely  and reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent 
5583,you have fainted  said the lady in an awe struck voice 
5584,perhaps the air will do you good 
5585,and perhaps it had  for here she was  feeling rather better among a lot of flowers 
5586,i m sure i don t want to intrude  began leonard  in answer to margaret s question 
5587,but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered  why  i wondered whether  
5588,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again  supplied helen 
5589,meg  this has been a cheerful business 
5590,a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment 
5591,margaret shook her head and returned to mr  bast 
5592,i don t understand 
5593,you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern  didn t you 
5594,that s right 
5595,and went into a bank instead 
5596,i told you all that  said helen  and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month  and now he s penniless  and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame 
5597,i hate all this  leonard muttered 
5598,i hope you do  mr  bast 
5599,but it s no good mincing matters 
5600,you have done yourself no good by coming here 
5601,if you intend to confront mr  wilcox  and to call him to account for a chance remark  you will make a very great mistake 
5602,i brought them 
5603,i did it all  cried helen 
5604,i can only advise you to go at once 
5605,my sister has put you in a false position  and it is kindest to tell you so 
5606,it s too late to get to town  but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton  where mrs  bast can rest  and i hope you ll be my guests there 
5607,that isn t what i want  miss schlegel  said leonard 
5608,you re very kind  and no doubt it s a false position  but you make me miserable 
5609,i seem no good at all 
5610,it s work he wants  interpreted helen 
5611,can t you see 
5612,then he said  jacky  let s go 
5613,we re more bother than we re worth 
5614,we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us  and they never will 
5615,there s nothing we re good enough to do 
5616,we would like to find you work  said margaret rather conventionally 
5617,we want to  i  like my sister 
5618,you re only down in your luck 
5619,go to the hotel  have a good night s rest  and some day you shall pay me back the bill  if you prefer it 
5620,but leonard was near the abyss  and at such moments men see clearly 
5621,you don t know what you re talking about  he said 
5622,i shall never get work now 
5623,if rich people fail at one profession  they can try another 
5624,not i 
5625,i had my groove  and i ve got out of it 
5626,i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary  but that s all 
5627,poetry s nothing  miss schlegel 
5628,one s thoughts about this and that are nothing 
5629,your money  too  is nothing  if you ll understand me  i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job  it s all over with him 
5630,i have seen it happen to others 
5631,their friends gave them money for a little  but in the end they fall over the edge 
5632,it s no good 
5633,it s the whole world pulling 
5634,there always will be rich and poor 
5635,he ceased 
5636,won t you have something to eat 
5637,said margaret 
5638,i don t know what to do 
5639,it isn t my house  and though mr  wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time  as i say  i don t know what to do  but i undertake to do what i can for you 
5640,helen  offer them something 
5641,do try a sandwich  mrs  bast 
5642,they moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing 
5643,iced cakes  sandwiches innumerable  coffee  claret cup  champagne  remained almost intact  their overfed guests could do no more 
5644,leonard refused 
5645,jacky thought she could manage a little 
5646,margaret left them whispering together  and had a few more words with helen 
5647,she said  helen  i like mr  bast 
5648,i agree that he s worth helping 
5649,i agree that we are directly responsible 
5650,no  indirectly 
5651,via mr  wilcox 
5652,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude  i ll do nothing 
5653,no doubt you re right logically  and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry 
5654,only  i won t have it 
5655,so choose 
5656,helen looked at the sunset 
5657,if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them  in my own way  mind  there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice 
5658,i have no use for justice 
5659,if it was only a question of money  we could do it ourselves 
5660,but he wants work  and that we can t give him  but possibly henry can 
5661,it s his duty to  grumbled helen 
5662,nor am i concerned with duty 
5663,i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know  and how  things being as they are  things may be made a little better 
5664,mr  wilcox hates being asked favours  all business men do 
5665,but i am going to ask him  at the risk of a rebuff  because i want to make things a little better 
5666,very well 
5667,i promise 
5668,you take it very calmly 
5669,take them off to the george  then  and i ll try 
5670,poor creatures  but they look tired 
5671,as they parted  she added  i haven t nearly done with you  though  helen 
5672,you have been most self indulgent 
5673,i can t get over it 
5674,you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older 
5675,think it over and alter yourself  or we shan t have happy lives 
5676,she rejoined henry 
5677,fortunately he had been sitting down  these physical matters were important 
5678,was it townees 
5679,he asked  greeting her with a pleasant smile 
5680,you ll never believe me  said margaret  sitting down beside him 
5681,it s all right now  but it was my sister 
5682,helen here 
5683,he cried  preparing to rise 
5684,but she refused the invitation 
5685,i thought hated weddings 
5686,don t get up 
5687,she has not come to the wedding 
5688,i ve bundled her off to the george 
5689,inherently hospitable  he protested 
5690,no  she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them 
5691,let them all come 
5692,my dear henry  did you see them 
5693,i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman  certainly 
5694,the brown bunch was helen  but did you catch sight of a sea green and salmon bunch 
5695,what  are they out bean feasting 
5696,no  business 
5697,they wanted to see me  and later on i want to talk to you about them 
5698,she was ashamed of her own diplomacy 
5699,in dealing with a wilcox  how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship  and to give him the kind of woman that he desired 
5700,henry took the hint at once  and said  why later on 
5701,tell me now 
5702,no time like the present 
5703,shall i 
5704,if it isn t a long story 
5705,oh  not five minutes  but there s a sting at the end of it  for i want you to find the man some work in your office 
5706,what are his qualifications 
5707,i don t know 
5708,he s a clerk 
5709,how old 
5710,twenty five  perhaps 
5711,what s his name 
5712,bast  said margaret  and was about to remind him that they had met at wickham place  but stopped herself 
5713,it had not been a successful meeting 
5714,where was he before 
5715,dempster s bank 
5716,why did he leave 
5717,he asked  still remembering nothing 
5718,they reduced their staff 
5719,all right  i ll see him 
5720,it was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day 
5721,now she understood why some women prefer influence to rights 
5722,mrs  plynlimmon  when condemning suffragettes  had said  the woman who can t influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself 
5723,margaret had winced  but she was influencing henry now  and though pleased at her little victory  she knew that she had won it by the methods of the harem 
5724,i should be glad if you took him  she said  but i don t know whether he s qualified 
5725,i ll do what i can 
5726,but  margaret  this mustn t be taken as a precedent 
5727,no  of course  of course  
5728,i can t fit in your proteges every day 
5729,business would suffer 
5730,i can promise you he s the last 
5731,he  he s rather a special case 
5732,proteges always are 
5733,she let it stand at that 
5734,he rose with a little extra touch of complacency  and held out his hand to help her up 
5735,how wide the gulf between henry as he was and henry as helen thought he ought to be 
5736,and she herself  hovering as usual between the two  now accepting men as they are  now yearning with her sister for truth  love and truth  their warfare seems eternal 
5737,perhaps the whole visible world rests on it  and if they were one  life itself  like the spirits when prospero was reconciled to his brother  might vanish into air  into thin air 
5738,your protege has made us late  said he 
5739,the fussells  will just be starting 
5740,on the whole she sided with men as they are 
5741,henry would save the basts as he had saved howards end  while helen and her friends were discussing the ethics of salvation 
5742,his was a slap dash method  but the world has been built slap dash  and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset may be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his joins 
5743,oniton  like herself  was imperfect 
5744,its apple trees were stunted  its castle ruinous 
5745,it  too  had suffered in the border warfare between the anglo saxon and the celt  between things as they are and as they ought to be 
5746,once more the west was retreating  once again the orderly stars were dotting the eastern sky 
5747,there is certainly no rest for us on the earth 
5748,but there is happiness  and as margaret descended the mound on her lover s arm  she felt that she was having her share 
5749,to her annoyance  mrs  bast was still in the garden  the husband and helen had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage rooms 
5750,margaret found this woman repellent 
5751,she had felt  when shaking her hand  an overpowering shame 
5752,she remembered the motive of her call at wickham place  and smelt again odours from the abyss  odours the more disturbing because they were involuntary 
5753,for there was no malice in jacky 
5754,there she sat  a piece of cake in one hand  an empty champagne glass in the other  doing no harm to anybody 
5755,she s overtired  margaret whispered 
5756,she s something else  said henry 
5757,this won t do 
5758,i can t have her in my garden in this state 
5759,is she   margaret hesitated to add drunk 
5760,now that she was going to marry him  he had grown particular 
5761,he discountenanced risque conversations now 
5762,henry went up to the woman 
5763,she raised her face  which gleamed in the twilight like a puff ball 
5764,madam  you will be more comfortable at the hotel  he said sharply 
5765,jacky replied  if it isn t hen 
5766,ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble  apologised margaret 
5767,il est tout fait diff rent 
5768,henry  she repeated  quite distinctly 
5769,mr  wilcox was much annoyed 
5770,i congratulate you on your proteges  he remarked 
5771,hen  don t go 
5772,you do love me  dear  don t you 
5773,bless us  what a person  sighed margaret  gathering up her skirts 
5774,jacky pointed with her cake 
5775,you re a nice boy  you are 
5776,she yawned 
5777,there now  i love you 
5778,henry  i am awfully sorry 
5779,and pray why 
5780,he asked  and looked at her so sternly that she feared he was ill 
5781,he seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded 
5782,to have brought this down on you 
5783,pray don t apologise 
5784,the voice continued 
5785,why does she call you hen  
5786,said margaret innocently 
5787,has she ever seen you before 
5788,seen hen before  said jacky 
5789,who hasn t seen hen 
5790,he s serving you like me  my boys 
5791,you wait  still we love them 
5792,are you now satisfied 
5793,henry asked 
5794,margaret began to grow frightened 
5795,i don t know what it is all about  she said 
5796,let s come in 
5797,but he thought she was acting 
5798,he thought he was trapped 
5799,he saw his whole life crumbling 
5800,don t you indeed 
5801,he said bitingly 
5802,i do 
5803,allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan 
5804,this is helen s plan  not mine 
5805,i now understand your interest in the basts 
5806,very well thought out 
5807,i am amused at your caution  margaret 
5808,you are quite right  it was necessary 
5809,i am a man  and have lived a man s past 
5810,i have the honour to release you from your engagement 
5811,still she could not understand 
5812,she knew of life s seamy side as a theory  she could not grasp it as a fact 
5813,more words from jacky were necessary  words unequivocal  undenied 
5814,so that   burst from her  and she went indoors 
5815,she stopped herself from saying more 
5816,so what 
5817,asked colonel fussell  who was getting ready to start in the hall 
5818,we were saying  henry and i were just having the fiercest argument  my point being   seizing his fur coat from a footman  she offered to help him on 
5819,he protested  and there was a playful little scene 
5820,no  let me do that  said henry  following 
5821,thanks so much 
5822,you see  he has forgiven me 
5823,the colonel said gallantly  i don t expect there s much to forgive 
5824,he got into the car 
5825,the ladies followed him after an interval 
5826,maids  courier  and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch line 
5827,still chattering  still thanking their host and patronising their future hostess  the guests were borne away 
5828,then margaret continued  so that woman has been your mistress 
5829,you put it with your usual delicacy  he replied 
5830,when  please 
5831,why 
5832,when  please 
5833,ten years ago 
5834,she left him without a word 
5835,for it was not her tragedy  it was mrs  wilcox s 
5836,helen began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in making some people ill and others angry 
5837,now that the wave of excitement was ebbing  and had left her  mr  bast  and mrs  bast stranded for the night in a shropshire hotel  she asked herself what forces had made the wave flow 
5838,at all events  no harm was done 
5839,margaret would play the game properly now  and though helen disapproved of her sister s methods  she knew that the basts would benefit by them in the long run 
5840,mr  wilcox is so illogical  she explained to leonard  who had put his wife to bed  and was sitting with her in the empty coffee room 
5841,if we told him it was his duty to take you on  he might refuse to do it 
5842,the fact is  he isn t properly educated 
5843,i don t want to set you against him  but you ll find him a trial 
5844,i can never thank you sufficiently  miss schlegel  was all that leonard felt equal to 
5845,i believe in personal responsibility 
5846,don t you 
5847,and in personal everything 
5848,i hate  i suppose i oughtn t to say that  but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely 
5849,or perhaps it isn t their fault 
5850,perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads  and then it s a waste of time to blame them 
5851,there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i  had you heard that 
5852,i get no time for reading 
5853,had you thought it  then 
5854,that there are two kinds of people  our kind  who live straight from the middle of their heads  and the other kind who can t  because their heads have no middle 
5855,they can t say i 
5856,they aren t in fact  and so they re supermen 
5857,pierpont morgan has never said i in his life 
5858,leonard roused himself 
5859,if his benefactress wanted intellectual conversation  she must have it 
5860,she was more important than his ruined past 
5861,i never got on to nietzsche  he said 
5862,but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists 
5863,oh no  that s wrong  replied helen 
5864,no superman ever said i want  because i want must lead to the question  who am i 
5865,and so to pity and to justice 
5866,he only says want 
5867,want europe  if he s napoleon  want wives  if he s bluebeard  want botticelli  if he s pierpont morgan 
5868,never the i   and if you could pierce through the superman  you d find panic and emptiness in the middle 
5869,leonard was silent for a moment 
5870,then he said  may i take it  miss schlegel  that you and i are both the sort that say i  
5871,of course 
5872,and your sister  too 
5873,of course  repeated helen  a little sharply 
5874,she was annoyed with margaret  but did not want her discussed 
5875,all presentable people say i 
5876,but mr  wilcox  he is not perhaps  
5877,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr  wilcox either 
5878,quite so  quite so  he agreed 
5879,helen asked herself why she had snubbed him 
5880,once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise  and then had pulled him up short 
5881,was she afraid of him presuming 
5882,if so  it was disgusting of her 
5883,but he was thinking the snub quite natural 
5884,everything she did was natural  and incapable of causing offence 
5885,while the miss schlegels were together he had felt them scarcely human  a sort of admonitory whirligig 
5886,but a miss schlegel alone was different 
5887,she was in helen s case unmarried  in margaret s about to be married  in neither case an echo of her sister 
5888,a light had fallen at last into this rich upper world  and he saw that it was full of men and women  some of whom were more friendly to him than others 
5889,helen had become his miss schlegel  who scolded him and corresponded with him  and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence 
5890,margaret  though not unkind  was severe and remote 
5891,he would not presume to help her  for instance 
5892,he had never liked her  and began to think that his original impression was true  and that her sister did not like her either 
5893,helen was certainly lonely 
5894,she  who gave away so much  was receiving too little 
5895,leonard was pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about mr  wilcox 
5896,jacky had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn 
5897,after the first shock  he did not mind for himself 
5898,by now he had no illusions about his wife  and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure 
5899,to keep perfection perfect  that should be his ideal  if the future gave him time to have ideals 
5900,helen  and margaret for helen s sake  must not know 
5901,helen disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife 
5902,mrs  bast  does she ever say i  
5903,she asked  half mischievously  and then  is she very tired 
5904,it s better she stops in her room  said leonard 
5905,shall i sit up with her 
5906,no  thank you  she does not need company 
5907,mr  bast  what kind of woman is your wife 
5908,leonard blushed up to his eyes 
5909,you ought to know my ways by now 
5910,does that question offend you 
5911,no  oh no  miss schlegel  no 
5912,because i love honesty 
5913,don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one 
5914,you and she can have nothing in common 
5915,he did not deny it  but said shyly  i suppose that s pretty obvious  but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm 
5916,when things went wrong  or i heard things  i used to think it was her fault  but  looking back  it s more mine 
5917,i needn t have married her  but as i have i must stick to her and keep her 
5918,how long have you been married 
5919,nearly three years 
5920,what did your people say 
5921,they will not have anything to do with us 
5922,they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married  and cut us off altogether 
5923,helen began to pace up and down the room 
5924,my good boy  what a mess  she said gently 
5925,who are your people 
5926,he could answer this 
5927,his parents  who were dead  had been in trade  his sisters had married commercial travellers  his brother was a lay reader 
5928,and your grandparents 
5929,leonard told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now 
5930,they were just nothing at all  he said agricultural labourers and that sort 
5931,from which part 
5932,lincolnshire mostly  but my mother s father  he  oddly enough  came from these parts round here 
5933,from this very shropshire 
5934,yes  that is odd 
5935,my mother s people were lancashire 
5936,but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs  bast 
5937,oh  i don t know 
5938,excuse me  you do know 
5939,i am not a baby 
5940,i can bear anything you tell me  and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help 
5941,have they heard anything against her 
5942,he was silent 
5943,i think i have guessed now  said helen very gravely 
5944,i don t think so  miss schlegel  i hope not 
5945,we must be honest  even over these things 
5946,i have guessed 
5947,i am frightfully  dreadfully sorry  but it does not make the least difference to me  i shall feel just the same to both of you 
5948,i blame  not your wife for these things  but men 
5949,leonard left it at that  so long as she did not guess the man  she stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds  the hotel looked over a dark square  the mists had begun  when she turned back to him her eyes were shining  don t you worry  he pleaded  i can t bear that  we shall be all right if i get work  if i could only get work  something regular to do 
5950,then it wouldn t be so bad again 
5951,i don t trouble after books as i used 
5952,i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again 
5953,it stops one thinking 
5954,settle down to what 
5955,oh  just settle down 
5956,and that s to be life  said helen  with a catch in her throat 
5957,how can you  with all the beautiful things to see and do  with music  with walking at night  
5958,walking is well enough when a man s in work  he answered 
5959,oh  i did talk a lot of nonsense once  but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you 
5960,when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons  i seemed to see life straight and real  and it isn t a pretty sight 
5961,my books are back again  thanks to you  but they ll never be the same to me again  and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful 
5962,why not 
5963,asked helen  throwing up the window 
5964,because i see one must have money 
5965,well  you re wrong 
5966,i wish i was wrong  but  the clergyman  he has money of his own  or else he s paid  the poet or the musician  just the same  the tramp  he s no different 
5967,the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end  and is paid for with other people s money 
5968,miss schlegel  the real thing s money  and all the rest is a dream 
5969,you re still wrong 
5970,you ve forgotten death 
5971,leonard could not understand 
5972,if we lived forever  what you say would be true 
5973,but we have to die  we have to leave life presently 
5974,injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever 
5975,as it is  we must hold to other things  because death is coming 
5976,i love death  not morbidly  but because he explains 
5977,he shows me the emptiness of money 
5978,death and money are the eternal foes 
5979,not death and life 
5980,never mind what lies behind death  mr  bast  but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say  i am i 
5981,i wonder 
5982,we are all in a mist  i know  but i can help you this far  men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any 
5983,sane  sound englishmen  building up empires  levelling all the world into what they call common sense 
5984,but mention death to them and they re offended  because death s really imperial  and he cries out against them for ever 
5985,i am as afraid of death as any one 
5986,but not of the idea of death 
5987,but what is the difference 
5988,infinite difference  said helen  more gravely than before 
5989,leonard looked at her wondering  and had the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night 
5990,but he could not receive them  because his heart was still full of little things 
5991,as the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at queen s hall  so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner harmonies now 
5992,death  life  and materialism were fine words  but would mr  wilcox take him on as a clerk 
5993,talk as one would  mr  wilcox was king of this world  the superman  with his own morality  whose head remained in the clouds 
5994,i must be stupid  he said apologetically 
5995,while to helen the paradox became clearer and clearer 
5996,death destroys a man  the idea of death saves him 
5997,behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it 
5998,men of the world may recoil from the charnel house that they will one day enter  but love knows better 
5999,death is his foe  but his peer  and in their age long struggle the thews of love have been strengthened  and his vision cleared  until there is no one who can stand against him 
6000,so never give in  continued the girl  and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the invisible lodges against the visible 
6001,her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened leonard to the earth 
6002,woven of bitter experience  it resisted her 
6003,presently the waitress entered and gave her a letter from margaret 
6004,another note  addressed to leonard  was inside 
6005,they read them  listening to the murmurings of the river 
6006,for many hours margaret did nothing  then she controlled herself  and wrote some letters 
6007,she was too bruised to speak to henry  she could pity him  and even determine to marry him  but as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech 
6008,on the surface the sense of his degradation was too strong 
6009,she could not command voice or look  and the gentle words that she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other person 
6010,my dearest boy  she began  this is not to part us 
6011,it is everything or nothing  and i mean it to be nothing 
6012,it happened long before we ever met  and even if it had happened since  i should be writing the same  i hope 
6013,i do understand 
6014,but she crossed out i do understand   it struck a false note 
6015,henry could not bear to be understood 
6016,she also crossed out  it is everything or nothing 
6017,henry would resent so strong a grasp of the situation 
6018,she must not comment  comment is unfeminine 
6019,i think that ll about do  she thought 
6020,then the sense of his degradation choked her 
6021,was he worth all this bother 
6022,to have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything  yes  it was  and she could not be his wife 
6023,she tried to translate his temptation into her own language  and her brain reeled 
6024,men must be different even to want to yield to such a temptation 
6025,her belief in comradeship was stifled  and she saw life as from that glass saloon on the great western which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh air 
6026,are the sexes really races  each with its own code of morality  and their mutual love a mere device of nature to keep things going 
6027,strip human intercourse of the proprieties  and is it reduced to this 
6028,her judgment told her no 
6029,she knew that out of nature s device we have built a magic that will win us immortality 
6030,far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call  far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and the garbage that nourishes it 
6031,we are evolving  in ways that science cannot measure  to ends that theology dares not contemplate 
6032,men did produce one jewel  the gods will say  and  saying  will give us immortality 
6033,margaret knew all this  but for the moment she could not feel it  and transformed the marriage of evie and mr  cahill into a carnival of fools  and her own marriage  too miserable to think of that  she tore up the letter  and then wrote another 
6034,dear mr  bast 
6035,i have spoken to mr  wilcox about you  as i promised  and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for you 
6036,yours truly 
6037,m  j  schlegel 
6038,she enclosed this in a note to helen  over which she took less trouble than she might have done  but her head was aching  and she could not stop to pick her words 
6039,dear helen 
6040,give him this 
6041,the basts are no good 
6042,henry found the woman drunk on the lawn 
6043,i am having a room got ready for you here  and will you please come round at once on getting this 
6044,the basts are not at all the type we should trouble about 
6045,i may go round to them myself in the morning  and do anything that is fair 
6046,in writing this  margaret felt that she was being practical 
6047,something might be arranged for the basts later on  but they must be silenced for the moment 
6048,she hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and helen 
6049,she rang the bell for a servant  but no one answered it  mr  wilcox and the warringtons were gone to bed  and the kitchen was abandoned to saturnalia 
6050,consequently she went over to the george herself 
6051,she did not enter the hotel  for discussion would have been perilous  and  saying that the letter was important  she gave it to the waitress 
6052,as she recrossed the square she saw helen and mr  bast looking out of the window of the coffee room  and feared she was already too late 
6053,her task was not yet over  she ought to tell henry what she had done 
6054,this came easily  for she saw him in the hall 
6055,the night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall  and the noise had disturbed him 
6056,who s there 
6057,he called  quite the householder 
6058,margaret walked in and past him 
6059,i have asked helen to sleep  she said 
6060,she is best here  so don t lock the front door 
6061,i thought some one had got in  said henry 
6062,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him 
6063,i don t know about later  but now the basts must clearly go 
6064,did you say that your sister is sleeping here  after all 
6065,probably 
6066,is she to be shown up to your room 
6067,i have naturally nothing to say to her  i am going to bed 
6068,will you tell the servants about helen 
6069,could some one go to carry her bag 
6070,he tapped a little gong  which had been bought to summon the servants 
6071,you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear 
6072,henry opened a door  and down the corridor came shouts of laughter 
6073,far too much screaming there  he said  and strode towards it 
6074,margaret went upstairs  uncertain whether to be glad that they had met  or sorry 
6075,they had behaved as if nothing had happened  and her deepest instincts told her that this was wrong 
6076,for his own sake  some explanation was due 
6077,and yet  what could an explanation tell her  a date  a place  a few details  which she could imagine all too clearly  now that the first shock was over  she saw that there was every reason to premise a mrs  bast  henry s inner life had long laid open to her  his intellectual confusion  his obtuseness to personal influence  his strong but furtive passions 
6078,should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded 
6079,perhaps 
6080,perhaps  if the dishonour had been done to her  but it was done long before her day 
6081,she struggled against the feeling 
6082,she told herself that mrs  wilcox s wrong was her own 
6083,but she was not a barren theorist 
6084,as she undressed  her anger  her regard for the dead  her desire for a scene  all grew weak 
6085,henry must have it as he liked  for she loved him  and some day she would use her love to make him a better man 
6086,pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis 
6087,pity  if one may generalise  is at the bottom of woman 
6088,when men like us  it is for our better qualities  and however tender their liking  we dare not be unworthy of it  or they will quietly let us go 
6089,but unworthiness stimulates woman 
6090,it brings out her deeper nature  for good or for evil 
6091,here was the core of the question 
6092,henry must be forgiven  and made better by love  nothing else mattered 
6093,mrs  wilcox  that unquiet yet kindly ghost  must be left to her own wrong 
6094,to her everything was in proportion now  and she  too  would pity the man who was blundering up and down their lives 
6095,had mrs  wilcox known of his trespass 
6096,an interesting question  but margaret fell asleep  tethered by affection  and lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from wales 
6097,she felt herself at one with her future home  colouring it and coloured by it  and awoke to see  for the second time  oniton castle conquering the morning mists 
6098,henry dear   was her greeting 
6099,he had finished his breakfast  and was beginning the times 
6100,his sister in law was packing 
6101,margaret knelt by him and took the paper from him  feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick 
6102,then  putting her face where it had been  she looked up in his eyes 
6103,henry dear  look at me 
6104,no  i won t have you shirking 
6105,look at me 
6106,there 
6107,that s all 
6108,you re referring to last evening  he said huskily 
6109,i have released you from your engagement 
6110,i could find excuses  but i won t 
6111,no  i won t 
6112,a thousand times no 
6113,i m a bad lot  and must be left at that 
6114,expelled from his old fortress  mr  wilcox was building a new one 
6115,he could no longer appear respectable to her  so he defended himself instead in a lurid past 
6116,it was not true repentance 
6117,leave it where you will  boy 
6118,it s not going to trouble us  i know what i m talking about  and it will make no difference 
6119,no difference 
6120,he inquired 
6121,no difference  when you find that i am not the fellow you thought 
6122,he was annoyed with miss schlegel here 
6123,he would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow  or even to rage 
6124,against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not altogether womanly 
6125,her eyes gazed too straight  they had read books that are suitable for men only 
6126,and though he had dreaded a scene  and though she had determined against one  there was a scene  all the same 
6127,it was somehow imperative 
6128,i am unworthy of you  he began 
6129,had i been worthy  i should not have released you from your engagement 
6130,i know what i am talking about 
6131,i can t bear to talk of such things 
6132,we had better leave it 
6133,she kissed his hand 
6134,he jerked it from her  and  rising to his feet  went on  you  with your sheltered life  and refined pursuits  and friends  and books  you and your sister  and women like you  i say  how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man 
6135,it is difficult for us  said margaret  but if we are worth marrying  we do guess 
6136,cut off from decent society and family ties  what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas 
6137,isolated 
6138,no one near 
6139,i know by bitter experience  and yet you say it makes no difference 
6140,not to me 
6141,he laughed bitterly 
6142,margaret went to the sideboard and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes 
6143,being the last down  she turned out the spirit lamp that kept them warm 
6144,she was tender  but grave 
6145,she knew that henry was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between the male soul and the female  and she did not desire to hear him on this point 
6146,did helen come 
6147,she asked 
6148,he shook his head 
6149,but that won t do at all  at all 
6150,we don t want her gossiping with mrs  bast 
6151,good god  no  he exclaimed  suddenly natural 
6152,then he caught himself up 
6153,let them gossip  my game s up  though i thank you for your unselfishness  little as my thanks are worth 
6154,didn t she send me a message or anything 
6155,i heard of none 
6156,would you ring the bell  please 
6157,what to do 
6158,why  to inquire 
6159,he swaggered up to it tragically  and sounded a peal 
6160,margaret poured herself out some coffee 
6161,the butler came  and said that miss schlegel had slept at the george  so far as he had heard 
6162,should he go round to the george 
6163,i ll go  thank you  said margaret  and dismissed him 
6164,it is no good  said henry 
6165,those things leak out  you cannot stop a story once it has started 
6166,i have known cases of other men  i despised them once  i thought that i m different  i shall never be tempted  oh  margaret   he came and sat down near her  improvising emotion 
6167,she could not bear to listen to him 
6168,we fellows all come to grief once in our time 
6169,will you believe that 
6170,there are moments when the strongest man   let him who standeth  take heed lest he fall  that s true  isn t it  if you knew all  you would excuse me  i was far from good influences  far even from england 
6171,i was very  very lonely  and longed for a woman s voice 
6172,that s enough 
6173,i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now 
6174,yes  that s enough  dear 
6175,i have   he lowered his voice   i have been through hell 
6176,gravely she considered this claim 
6177,had he 
6178,had he suffered tortures of remorse  or had it been  there  that s over 
6179,now for respectable life again  
6180,the latter  if she read him rightly 
6181,a man who has been through hell does not boast of his virility 
6182,he is humble and hides it  if  indeed  it still exists 
6183,only in legend does the sinner come forth penitent  but terrible  to conquer pure woman by his resistless power 
6184,henry was anxious to be terrible  but had not got it in him 
6185,he was a good average englishman  who had slipped 
6186,the really culpable point  his faithlessness to mrs  wilcox  never seemed to strike him 
6187,she longed to mention mrs  wilcox 
6188,and bit by bit the story was told her 
6189,it was a very simple story 
6190,ten years ago was the time  a garrison town in cyprus the place 
6191,now and then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him  and she answered  i have already forgiven you  henry 
6192,she chose her words carefully  and so saved him from panic 
6193,she played the girl  until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world 
6194,when the butler came to clear away  henry was in a very different mood  asked the fellow what he was in such a hurry for  complained of the noise last night in the servants hall  margaret looked intently at the butler  he  as a handsome young man  was faintly attractive to her as a woman  an attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible  yet the skies would have fallen if she had mentioned it to henry 
6195,on her return from the george the building operations were complete  and the old henry fronted her  competent  cynical  and kind 
6196,he had made a clean breast  had been forgiven  and the great thing now was to forget his failure  and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments 
6197,jacky rejoined howards end and dude street  and the vermilion motor car  and the argentine hard dollars  and all the things and people for whom he had never had much use and had less now 
6198,their memory hampered him 
6199,he could scarcely attend to margaret  who brought back disquieting news from the george 
6200,helen and her clients had gone 
6201,well  let them go  the man and his wife  i mean  for the more we see of your sister the better 
6202,but they have gone separately  helen very early  the basts just before i arrived 
6203,they have left no message 
6204,they have answered neither of my notes 
6205,i don t like to think what it all means 
6206,what did you say in the notes 
6207,i told you last night 
6208,oh  ah  yes 
6209,dear  would you like one turn in the garden 
6210,margaret took his arm 
6211,the beautiful weather soothed her 
6212,but the wheels of evie s wedding were still at work  tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had drawn them in  and she could not be with him long 
6213,it had been arranged that they should motor to shrewsbury  whence he would go north  and she back to london with the warringtons 
6214,for a fraction of time she was happy 
6215,then her brain recommenced 
6216,i am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the george 
6217,helen would not have left unless she had heard something 
6218,i mismanaged that 
6219,it is wretched 
6220,i ought to have parted her from that woman at once 
6221,margaret  he exclaimed  loosing her arm impressively 
6222,yes  yes  henry 
6223,i am far from a saint  in fact  the reverse  but you have taken me  for better or worse 
6224,bygones must be bygones 
6225,you have promised to forgive me 
6226,margaret  a promise is a promise 
6227,never mention that woman again 
6228,except for some practical reason  never 
6229,practical 
6230,you practical 
6231,yes  i m practical  she murmured  stooping over the mowing machine and playing with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand 
6232,he had silenced her  but her fears made him uneasy 
6233,not for the first time  he was threatened with blackmail 
6234,he was rich and supposed to be moral  the basts knew that he was not  and might find it profitable to hint as much 
6235,at all events  you mustn t worry  he said 
6236,this is a man s business 
6237,he thought intently 
6238,on no account mention it to anybody 
6239,margaret flushed at advice so elementary  but he was really paving the way for a lie 
6240,if necessary he would deny that he had ever known mrs  bast  and prosecute her for libel 
6241,perhaps he never had known her 
6242,here was margaret  who behaved as if he had not 
6243,there the house 
6244,round them were half a dozen gardeners  clearing up after his daughter s wedding 
6245,all was so solid and spruce  that the past flew up out of sight like a spring blind  leaving only the last five minutes unrolled 
6246,glancing at these  he saw that the car would be round during the next five  and plunged into action 
6247,gongs were tapped  orders issued  margaret was sent to dress  and the housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass that she had left across the hall 
6248,as is man to the universe  so was the mind of mr  wilcox to the minds of some men  a concentrated light upon a tiny spot  a little ten minutes moving self contained through its appointed years 
6249,no pagan he  who lives for the now  and may be wiser than all philosophers 
6250,he lived for the five minutes that have past  and the five to come  he had the business mind 
6251,how did he stand now  as his motor slipped out of oniton and breasted the great round hills 
6252,margaret had heard a certain rumour  but was all right 
6253,she had forgiven him  god bless her  and he felt the manlier for it 
6254,charles and evie had not heard it  and never must hear 
6255,no more must paul 
6256,over his children he felt great tenderness  which he did not try to track to a because  mrs  wilcox was too far back in his life 
6257,he did not connect her with the sudden aching love that he felt for evie 
6258,poor little evie  he trusted that cahill would make her a decent husband 
6259,and margaret 
6260,how did she stand 
6261,she had several minor worries 
6262,clearly her sister had heard something 
6263,she dreaded meeting her in town 
6264,and she was anxious about leonard  for whom they certainly were responsible 
6265,nor ought mrs  bast to starve 
6266,but the main situation had not altered 
6267,she still loved henry 
6268,his actions  not his disposition  had disappointed her  and she could bear that 
6269,and she loved her future home 
6270,standing up in the car  just where she had leapt from it two days before  she gazed back with deep emotion upon oniton 
6271,besides the grange and the castle keep  she could now pick out the church and the black and white gables of the george 
6272,there was the bridge  and the river nibbling its green peninsula 
6273,she could even see the bathing she would  but while she was looking for charles s new spring board  the forehead of the hill rose and hid the whole scene 
6274,she never saw it again 
6275,day and night the river flows down into england  day after day the sun retreats into the welsh mountains  and the tower chimes  see the conquering hero 
6276,but the wilcoxes have no part in the place  nor in any place 
6277,it is not their names that recur in the parish register 
6278,it is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening 
6279,they have swept into the valley and swept out of it  leaving a little dust and a little money behind 
6280,tibby was now approaching his last year at oxford 
6281,he had moved out of college  and was contemplating the universe  or such portions of it as concerned him  from his comfortable lodgings in long wall 
6282,he was not concerned with much 
6283,when a young man is untroubled by passions and sincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily limited 
6284,tibby wished neither to strengthen the position of the rich nor to improve that of the poor  and so was well content to watch the elms nodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of magdalen 
6285,there are worse lives 
6286,though selfish  he was never cruel  though affected in manner  he never posed 
6287,like margaret  he disdained the heroic equipment  and it was only after many visits that men discovered schlegel to possess a character and a brain 
6288,he had done well in mods  much to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper exercise  and was now glancing disdainfully at chinese in case he should some day consent to qualify as a student interpreter 
6289,to him thus employed helen entered 
6290,a telegram had preceded her 
6291,he noticed  in a distant way  that his sister had altered 
6292,as a rule he found her too pronounced  and had never come across this look of appeal  pathetic yet dignified  the look of a sailor who has lost everything at sea 
6293,i have come from oniton  she began 
6294,there has been a great deal of trouble there 
6295,who s for lunch 
6296,said tibby  picking up the claret  which was warming in the hearth 
6297,helen sat down submissively at the table 
6298,why such an early start 
6299,he asked 
6300,sunrise or something  when i could get away 
6301,so i surmise 
6302,why 
6303,i don t know what s to be done  tibby 
6304,i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg  and do not want to face her  and i am not going back to wickham place 
6305,i stopped here to tell you this 
6306,the landlady came in with the cutlets 
6307,tibby put a marker in the leaves of his chinese grammar and helped them 
6308,oxford  the oxford of the vacation  dreamed and rustled outside  and indoors the little fire was coated with grey where the sunshine touched it 
6309,helen continued her odd story 
6310,give meg my love and say that i want to be alone 
6311,i mean to go to munich or else bonn 
6312,such a message is easily given  said her brother 
6313,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture  you and she are to do exactly as you like 
6314,my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold 
6315,what does one want with dusty economic books  which have made the world no better  or with mother s hideous chiffoniers 
6316,i have also another commission for you 
6317,i want you to deliver a letter 
6318,she got up 
6319,i haven t written it yet 
6320,why shouldn t i post it  though 
6321,she sat down again 
6322,my head is rather wretched 
6323,i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in 
6324,tibby locked the door 
6325,his friends often found it in this condition 
6326,then he asked whether anything had gone wrong at evie s wedding 
6327,not there  said helen  and burst into tears 
6328,he had known her hysterical  it was one of her aspects with which he had no concern  and yet these tears touched him as something unusual 
6329,they were nearer the things that did concern him  such as music 
6330,he laid down his knife and looked at her curiously 
6331,then  as she continued to sob  he went on with his lunch 
6332,the time came for the second course  and she was still crying 
6333,apple charlotte was to follow  which spoils by waiting 
6334,do you mind mrs  martlett coming in 
6335,he asked  or shall i take it from her at the door 
6336,could i bathe my eyes  tibby 
6337,he took her to his bedroom  and introduced the pudding in her absence 
6338,having helped himself  he put it down to warm in the hearth 
6339,his hand stretched towards the grammar  and soon he was turning over the pages  raising his eyebrows scornfully  perhaps at human nature  perhaps at chinese 
6340,to him thus employed helen returned 
6341,she had pulled herself together  but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes 
6342,now for the explanation  she said 
6343,why didn t i begin with it 
6344,i have found out something about mr  wilcox 
6345,he has behaved very wrongly indeed  and ruined two people s lives 
6346,it all came on me very suddenly last night  i am very much upset  and i do not know what to do 
6347,mrs  bast  
6348,oh  those people 
6349,helen seemed silenced 
6350,shall i lock the door again 
6351,no thanks  tibbikins 
6352,you re being very good to me  i want to tell you the story before i go abroad  you must do exactly what you like  treat it as part of the furniture 
6353,meg cannot have heard it yet  i think 
6354,but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself 
6355,i don t even know whether she ought to be told 
6356,knowing as she does that i dislike him  she will suspect me  and think that i want to ruin her match 
6357,i simply don t know what to make of such a thing 
6358,i trust your judgment 
6359,what would you do 
6360,i gather he has had a mistress  said tibby 
6361,helen flushed with shame and anger 
6362,and ruined two people s lives 
6363,and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing  and there always will be rich and poor 
6364,he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus  i don t wish to make him worse than he is  and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him 
6365,but there it is 
6366,they met 
6367,he goes his way and she goes hers 
6368,what do you suppose is the end of such women 
6369,he conceded that it was a bad business 
6370,they end in two ways  either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them  and because mr  wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy  or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late 
6371,she  i can t blame her 
6372,but this isn t all  she continued after a long pause  during which the landlady served them with coffee 
6373,i come now to the business that took us to oniton 
6374,we went all three 
6375,acting on mr  wilcox s advice  the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one  from which he is dismissed 
6376,there are certain excuses  but in the main mr  wilcox is to blame  as meg herself admitted 
6377,it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself 
6378,but he meets the woman  and  like the cur that he is  he refuses  and tries to get rid of them 
6379,he makes meg write 
6380,two notes came from her late that evening  one for me  one for leonard  dismissing him with barely a reason 
6381,i couldn t understand 
6382,then it comes out that mrs  bast had spoken to mr  wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms  and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her 
6383,this leonard knew all along 
6384,he thought it natural he should be ruined twice 
6385,natural 
6386,could you have contained yourself 
6387,it is certainly a very bad business  said tibby 
6388,his reply seemed to calm his sister 
6389,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion 
6390,but you are right outside it  and you must know 
6391,in a day or two  or perhaps a week  take whatever steps you think fit 
6392,i leave it in your hands 
6393,she concluded her charge 
6394,the facts as they touch meg are all before you  she added  and tibby sighed and felt it rather hard that  because of his open mind  he should be empanelled to serve as a juror 
6395,he had never been interested in human beings  for which one must blame him  but he had had rather too much of them at wickham place 
6396,just as some people cease to attend when books are mentioned  so tibby s attention wandered when personal relations came under discussion 
6397,ought margaret to know what helen knew the basts to know 
6398,similar questions had vexed him from infancy  and at oxford he had learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly overrated by specialists 
6399,the epigram  with its faint whiff of the eighties  meant nothing 
6400,but he might have let it off now if his sister had not been ceaselessly beautiful 
6401,you see  helen  have a cigarette  i don t see what i m to do 
6402,then there s nothing to be done 
6403,i dare say you are right 
6404,let them marry 
6405,there remains the question of compensation 
6406,do you want me to adjudicate that too 
6407,had you not better consult an expert 
6408,this part is in confidence  said helen 
6409,it has nothing to do with meg  and do not mention it to her 
6410,the compensation  i do not see who is to pay it if i don t  and i have already decided on the minimum sum 
6411,as soon as possible i am placing it to your account  and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me  i shall never forget your kindness  tibbikins  if you do this 
6412,what is the sum 
6413,five thousand 
6414,good god alive  said tibby  and went crimson 
6415,now  what is the good of driblets 
6416,to go through life having done one thing  to have raised one person from the abyss  not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets  making the grey more grey 
6417,no doubt people will think me extraordinary 
6418,i don t care an iota what people think  cried he  heated to unusual manliness of diction 
6419,but it s half what you have 
6420,not nearly half 
6421,she spread out her hands over her soiled skirt 
6422,i have far too much  and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet 
6423,what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two 
6424,it isn t enough 
6425,he could not recover 
6426,he was not angry or even shocked  and he saw that helen would still have plenty to live on 
6427,but it amazed him to think what haycocks people can make of their lives 
6428,his delicate intonations would not work  and he could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a great deal of bother for him personally 
6429,i didn t expect you to understand me 
6430,i understand nobody 
6431,but you ll do it 
6432,apparently 
6433,i leave you two commissions  then 
6434,the first concerns mr  wilcox  and you are to use your discretion 
6435,the second concerns the money  and is to be mentioned to no one  and carried out literally 
6436,you will send a hundred pounds on account to morrow 
6437,he walked with her to the station  passing through those streets whose serried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued 
6438,the lovely creature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue  and only the ganglion of vulgarity round carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom  how faint its claim to represent england 
6439,helen  rehearsing her commission  noticed nothing  the basts were in her brain  and she retold the crisis in a meditative way  which might have made other men curious 
6440,she was seeing whether it would hold 
6441,he asked her once why she had taken the basts right into the heart of evie s wedding 
6442,she stopped like a frightened animal and said  does that seem to you so odd 
6443,her eyes  the hand laid on the mouth  quite haunted him  until they were absorbed into the figure of st  mary the virgin  before whom he paused for a moment on the walk home 
6444,it is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties 
6445,margaret summoned him the next day 
6446,she was terrified at helen s flight  and he had to say that she had called in at oxford 
6447,then she said  did she seem worried at any rumour about henry 
6448,he answered  yes 
6449,i knew it was that  she exclaimed 
6450,i ll write to her 
6451,tibby was relieved 
6452,he then sent the cheque to the address that helen gave him  and stated that he was instructed to forward later on five thousand pounds 
6453,an answer came back very civil and quiet in tone  such an answer as tibby himself would have given 
6454,the cheque was returned  the legacy refused  the writer being in no need of money 
6455,tibby forwarded this to helen  adding in the fulness of his heart that leonard bast seemed somewhat a monumental person after all 
6456,helen s reply was frantic 
6457,he was to take no notice 
6458,he was to go down at once and say that she commanded acceptance 
6459,he went 
6460,a scurf of books and china ornaments awaited him 
6461,the basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent  and had wandered no one knew whither 
6462,helen had begun bungling with her money by this time  and had even sold out her shares in the nottingham and derby railway 
6463,for some weeks she did nothing 
6464,then she reinvested  and  owing to the good advice of her stockbrokers  became rather richer than she had been before 
6465,houses have their own ways of dying  falling as variously as the generations of men  some with a tragic roar  some quietly  but to an after life in the city of ghosts  while from others  and thus was the death of wickham place  the spirit slips before the body perishes 
6466,it had decayed in the spring  disintegrating the girls more than they knew  and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions 
6467,by september it was a corpse  void of emotion  and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty years of happiness 
6468,through its round topped doorway passed furniture  and pictures  and books  until the last room was gutted and the last van had rumbled away 
6469,it stood for a week or two longer  open eyed  as if astonished at its own emptiness 
6470,then it fell 
6471,navvies came  and spilt it back into the grey 
6472,with their muscles and their beery good temper  they were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been human  and had not mistaken culture for an end 
6473,the furniture  with a few exceptions  went down into hertfordshire  mr  wilcox having most kindly offered howards end as a warehouse 
6474,mr  bryce had died abroad  an unsatisfactory affair  and as there seemed little guarantee that the rent would be paid regularly  he cancelled the agreement  and resumed possession himself 
6475,until he relet the house  the schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower rooms 
6476,margaret demurred  but tibby accepted the offer gladly  it saved him from coming to any decision about the future 
6477,the plate and the more valuable pictures found a safer home in london  but the bulk of the things went country ways  and were entrusted to the guardianship of miss avery 
6478,shortly before the move  our hero and heroine were married 
6479,they have weathered the storm  and may reasonably expect peace 
6480,to have no illusions and yet to love  what stronger surety can a woman find  she had seen her husband s past as well as his heart  she knew her own heart with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible  the heart of mrs  wilcox was alone hidden  and perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of the dead  they were married quietly  really quietly  for as the day approached she refused to go through another oniton 
6481,her brother gave her away  her aunt  who was out of health  presided over a few colourless refreshments 
6482,the wilcoxes were represented by charles  who witnessed the marriage settlement  and by mr  cahill 
6483,paul did send a cablegram 
6484,in a few minutes  and without the aid of music  the clergyman made them man and wife  and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world 
6485,she  a monogamist  regretted the cessation of some of life s innocent odours  he  whose instincts were polygamous  felt morally braced by the change and less liable to the temptations that had assailed him in the past 
6486,they spent their honeymoon near innsbruck 
6487,henry knew of a reliable hotel there  and margaret hoped for a meeting with her sister 
6488,in this she was disappointed 
6489,as they came south  helen retreated over the brenner  and wrote an unsatisfactory post card from the shores of the lake of garda  saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be ignored 
6490,evidently she disliked meeting henry 
6491,two months are surely enough to accustom an outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted in two days  and margaret had again to regret her sister s lack of self control 
6492,in a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters  so little is known about them  it is hard enough for those who are personally touched to judge  then how futile must be the verdict of society 
6493,i don t say there is no standard  for that would destroy morality  only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood 
6494,helen thanked her for her kind letter  rather a curious reply 
6495,she moved south again  and spoke of wintering in naples 
6496,mr  wilcox was not sorry that the meeting failed 
6497,helen left him time to grow skin over his wound 
6498,there were still moments when it pained him 
6499,had he only known that margaret was awaiting him  margaret  so lively and intelligent  and yet so submissive  he would have kept himself worthier of her 
6500,incapable of grouping the past  he confused the episode of jacky with another episode that had taken place in the days of his bachelorhood 
6501,the two made one crop of wild oats  for which he was heartily sorry  and he could not see that those oats are of a darker stock which are rooted in another s dishonour 
6502,unchastity and infidelity were as confused to him as to the middle ages  his only moral teacher 
6503,ruth  poor old ruth   did not enter into his calculations at all  for poor old ruth had never found him out 
6504,his affection for his present wife grew steadily 
6505,her cleverness gave him no trouble  and  indeed  he liked to see her reading poetry or something about social questions  it distinguished her from the wives of other men 
6506,he had only to call  and she clapped the book up and was ready to do what he wished 
6507,then they would argue so jollily  and once or twice she had him in quite a tight corner  but as soon as he grew really serious  she gave in 
6508,man is for war  woman for the recreation of the warrior  but he does not dislike it if she makes a show of fight 
6509,she cannot win in a real battle  having no muscles  only nerves 
6510,nerves make her jump out of a moving motor car  or refuse to be married fashionably 
6511,the warrior may well allow her to triumph on such occasions  they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace 
6512,margaret had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon 
6513,he told her  casually  as was his habit  that oniton grange was let 
6514,she showed her annoyance  and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted 
6515,i didn t want to bother you  he replied 
6516,besides  i have only heard for certain this morning 
6517,where are we to live 
6518,said margaret  trying to laugh 
6519,i loved the place extraordinarily 
6520,don t you believe in having a permanent home  henry 
6521,he assured her that she misunderstood him 
6522,it is home life that distinguishes us from the foreigner 
6523,but he did not believe in a damp home 
6524,this is news 
6525,i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp 
6526,my dear girl 
6527,  he flung out his hand   have you eyes 
6528,have you a skin 
6529,how could it be anything but damp in such a situation 
6530,in the first place  the grange is on clay  and built where the castle moat must have been  then there s that detestable little river  steaming all night like a kettle 
6531,feel the cellar walls  look up under the eaves 
6532,ask sir james or any one 
6533,those shropshire valleys are notorious 
6534,the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill  but  for my part  i think the country is too far from london  and the scenery nothing special 
6535,margaret could not resist saying  why did you go there  then 
6536,i  because   he drew his head back and grew rather angry 
6537,why have we come to the tyrol  if it comes to that 
6538,one might go on asking such questions indefinitely 
6539,one might  but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer 
6540,out it came  and he believed it as soon as it was spoken 
6541,the truth is  i took oniton on account of evie 
6542,don t let this go any further 
6543,certainly not 
6544,i shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain 
6545,no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged 
6546,poor little girl 
6547,she was so keen on it all  and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting 
6548,afraid it would get snapped up  just like all of your sex 
6549,well  no harm s done 
6550,she has had her country wedding  and i ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school 
6551,where shall we live  then  henry 
6552,i should enjoy living somewhere 
6553,i have not yet decided 
6554,what about norfolk 
6555,margaret was silent 
6556,marriage had not saved her from the sense of flux 
6557,london was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilisation which is altering human nature so profoundly  and throws upon personal relations a stress greater than they have ever borne before 
6558,under cosmopolitanism  if it comes  we shall receive no help from the earth 
6559,trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle  and the binding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to love alone 
6560,may love be equal to the task 
6561,it is now what 
6562,continued henry 
6563,nearly october 
6564,let us camp for the winter at ducie street  and look out for something in the spring 
6565,if possible  something permanent 
6566,i can t be as young as i was  for these alterations don t suit me 
6567,but  my dear  which would you rather have  alterations or rheumatism 
6568,i see your point  said margaret  getting up 
6569,if oniton is really damp  it is impossible  and must be inhabited by little boys 
6570,only  in the spring  let us look before we leap 
6571,i will take warning by evie  and not hurry you 
6572,remember that you have a free hand this time 
6573,these endless moves must be bad for the furniture  and are certainly expensive 
6574,what a practical little woman it is 
6575,what s it been reading 
6576,theo  theo  how much 
6577,theosophy 
6578,so ducie street was her first fate  a pleasant enough fate  the house  being only a little larger than wickham place  trained her for the immense establishment that was promised in the spring  they were frequently away  but at home life ran fairly regularly  in the morning henry went to business  and his sandwich  a relic this of some prehistoric craving  was always cut by her own hand 
6579,he did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch  but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven 
6580,when he had gone  there was the house to look after  and the servants to humanise  and several kettles of helen s to keep on the boil 
6581,her conscience pricked her a little about the basts  she was not sorry to have lost sight of them 
6582,no doubt leonard was worth helping  but being henry s wife  she preferred to help some one else 
6583,as for theatres and discussion societies  they attracted her less and less 
6584,she began to miss new movements  and to spend her spare time re reading or thinking  rather to the concern of her chelsea friends 
6585,they attributed the change to her marriage  and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable 
6586,yet the main because lay deeper still  she had outgrown stimulants  and was passing from words to things 
6587,it was doubtless a pity not to keep up with wedekind or john  but some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty  if the mind itself is to become a creative power 
6588,she was looking at plans one day in the following spring  they had finally decided to go down into sussex and build  when mrs  charles wilcox was announced 
6589,have you heard the news 
6590,dolly cried  as soon as she entered the room 
6591,charles is so ang  i mean he is sure you know about it  or  rather  that you don t know 
6592,why  dolly  said margaret  placidly kissing her 
6593,here s a surprise 
6594,how are the boys and the baby 
6595,boys and the baby were well  and in describing a great row that there had been at the hilton tennis club  dolly forgot her news 
6596,the wrong people had tried to get in 
6597,the rector  as representing the older inhabitants  had said  charles had said  the tax collector had said  charles had regretted not saying  and she closed the description with  but lucky you  with four courts of your own at midhurst 
6598,it will be very jolly  replied margaret 
6599,are those the plans 
6600,does it matter my seeing them 
6601,of course not 
6602,charles has never seen the plans 
6603,they have only just arrived 
6604,here is the ground floor  no  that s rather difficult 
6605,try the elevation 
6606,we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky line 
6607,what makes it smell so funny 
6608,said dolly  after a moment s inspection 
6609,she was incapable of understanding plans or maps 
6610,i suppose the paper 
6611,and which way up is it 
6612,just the ordinary way up 
6613,that s the sky line and the part that smells strongest is the sky 
6614,well  ask me another 
6615,margaret  oh  what was i going to say 
6616,how s helen 
6617,quite well 
6618,is she never coming back to england 
6619,every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t 
6620,so it is  said margaret  trying to conceal her vexation 
6621,she was getting rather sore on this point 
6622,helen is odd  awfully 
6623,she has now been away eight months 
6624,but hasn t she any address 
6625,a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address 
6626,do write her a line 
6627,i will look it up for you 
6628,no  don t bother 
6629,that s eight months she has been away  surely 
6630,exactly 
6631,she left just after evie s wedding 
6632,it would be eight months 
6633,just when baby was born  then 
6634,just so 
6635,dolly sighed  and stared enviously round the drawing room 
6636,she was beginning to lose her brightness and good looks 
6637,the charles s were not well off  for mr  wilcox  having brought up his children with expensive tastes  believed in letting them shift for themselves 
6638,after all  he had not treated them generously 
6639,yet another baby was expected  she told margaret  and they would have to give up the motor 
6640,margaret sympathised  but in a formal fashion  and dolly little imagined that the stepmother was urging mr  wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance 
6641,she sighed again  and at last the particular grievance was remembered 
6642,oh  yes  she cried  that is it  miss avery has been unpacking your packing cases 
6643,why has she done that 
6644,how unnecessary 
6645,ask another 
6646,i suppose you ordered her to 
6647,i gave no such orders 
6648,perhaps she was airing the things 
6649,she did undertake to light an occasional fire 
6650,it was far more than an air  said dolly solemnly 
6651,the floor sounds covered with books 
6652,charles sent me to know what is to be done  for he feels certain you don t know 
6653,books  cried margaret  moved by the holy word 
6654,dolly  are you serious 
6655,has she been touching our books 
6656,hasn t she  though 
6657,what used to be the hall s full of them 
6658,charles thought for certain you knew of it 
6659,i am very much obliged to you  dolly 
6660,what can have come over miss avery 
6661,i must go down about it at once 
6662,some of the books are my brother s  and are quite valuable 
6663,she had no right to open any of the cases 
6664,i say she s dotty 
6665,she was the one that never got married  you know 
6666,oh  i say  perhaps  she thinks your books are wedding presents to herself 
6667,old maids are taken that way sometimes 
6668,miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie 
6669,i hadn t heard of that  said margaret 
6670,a visit from dolly had its compensations 
6671,didn t you know she gave evie a present last august  and evie returned it  and then  oh  goloshes 
6672,you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote 
6673,but it was wrong of evie to return it 
6674,it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing 
6675,but the present was so expensive 
6676,why does that make any difference  dolly 
6677,still  when it costs over five pounds  i didn t see it  but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop 
6678,you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman 
6679,now  can you 
6680,you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married 
6681,oh  mine was old earthenware stuff  not worth a halfpenny 
6682,evie s was quite different 
6683,you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that 
6684,uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible  and when four men agree  what is a girl to do 
6685,evie didn t want to upset the old thing  so thought a sort of joking letter best  and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble 
6686,but miss avery said  
6687,dolly s eyes grew round 
6688,it was a perfectly awful letter 
6689,charles said it was the letter of a madman 
6690,in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond 
6691,did she give any reasons 
6692,we think she meant to be invited to oniton  and so climb into society 
6693,she s rather old for that  said margaret pensively 
6694,may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother 
6695,that s a notion 
6696,give every one their due  eh 
6697,well  i suppose i ought to be toddling 
6698,come along  mr  muff  you want a new coat  but i don t know who ll give it you  i m sure  and addressing her apparel with mournful humour  dolly moved from the room 
6699,margaret followed her to ask whether henry knew about miss avery s rudeness 
6700,oh yes 
6701,i wonder  then  why he let me ask her to look after the house 
6702,but she s only a farm woman  said dolly  and her explanation proved correct 
6703,henry only censured the lower classes when it suited him 
6704,he bore with miss avery as with crane  because he could get good value out of them 
6705,i have patience with a man who knows his job  he would say  really having patience with the job  and not the man 
6706,paradoxical as it may sound  he had something of the artist about him  he would pass over an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his wife 
6707,margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble herself 
6708,parties were evidently ruffled 
6709,with henry s permission  she wrote a pleasant note to miss avery  asking her to leave the cases untouched 
6710,then  at the first convenient opportunity  she went down herself  intending to repack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse  the plan had been amateurish and a failure 
6711,tibby promised to accompany her  but at the last moment begged to be excused 
6712,so  for the second time in her life  she entered the house alone 
6713,the day of her visit was exquisite  and the last of unclouded happiness that she was to have for many months 
6714,her anxiety about helen s extraordinary absence was still dormant  and as for a possible brush with miss avery  that only gave zest to the expedition 
6715,she had also eluded dolly s invitation to luncheon 
6716,walking straight up from the station  she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church 
6717,the church itself stood in the village once 
6718,but it there attracted so many worshippers that the devil  in a pet  snatched it from its foundations  and poised it on an inconvenient knoll  three quarters of a mile away 
6719,if this story is true  the chestnut avenue must have been planted by the angels 
6720,no more tempting approach could be imagined for the lukewarm christian  and if he still finds the walk too long  the devil is defeated all the same  science having built holy trinity  a chapel of ease  near the charles s and roofed it with tin 
6721,up the avenue margaret strolled slowly  stopping to watch the sky that gleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts  or to finger the little horseshoes on the lower branches 
6722,why has not england a great mythology 
6723,our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness  and the greater melodies about our country side have all issued through the pipes of greece 
6724,deep and true as the native imagination can be  it seems to have failed here 
6725,it has stopped with the witches and the fairies 
6726,it cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field  or give names to half a dozen stars 
6727,england still waits for the supreme moment of her literature  for the great poet who shall voice her  or  better still for the thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk 
6728,at the church the scenery changed 
6729,the chestnut avenue opened into a road  smooth but narrow  which led into the untouched country 
6730,she followed it for over a mile 
6731,its little hesitations pleased her 
6732,having no urgent destiny  it strolled downhill or up as it wished  taking no trouble about the gradients  or about the view  which nevertheless expanded 
6733,the great estates that throttle the south of hertfordshire were less obtrusive here  and the appearance of the land was neither aristocratic nor suburban 
6734,to define it was difficult  but margaret knew what it was not  it was not snobbish 
6735,though its contours were slight  there was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which surrey will never attain  and the distant brow of the chilterns towered like a mountain 
6736,left to itself  was margaret s opinion  this county would vote liberal 
6737,the comradeship  not passionate  that is our highest gift as a nation  was promised by it  as by the low brick farm where she called for the key 
6738,but the inside of the farm was disappointing 
6739,a most finished young person received her 
6740,yes  mrs  wilcox  no  mrs  wilcox  oh yes  mrs  wilcox  auntie received your letter quite duly 
6741,auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment 
6742,shall i send the servant to direct you 
6743,followed by  of course  auntie does not generally look after your place  she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional 
6744,it gives her something to do 
6745,she spends quite a lot of her time there 
6746,my husband says to me sometimes  where s auntie 
6747,i say  need you ask 
6748,she s at howards end 
6749,yes  mrs  wilcox 
6750,mrs  wilcox  could i prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake 
6751,not if i cut it for you 
6752,margaret refused the cake  but unfortunately this gave her gentility in the eyes of miss avery s niece 
6753,i cannot let you go on alone 
6754,now don t 
6755,you really mustn t 
6756,i will direct you myself if it comes to that 
6757,i must get my hat 
6758,now   roguishly   mrs  wilcox  don t you move while i m gone 
6759,stunned  margaret did not move from the best parlour  over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen 
6760,but the other rooms looked in keeping  though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior 
6761,here had lived an elder race  to which we look back with disquietude 
6762,the country which we visit at week ends was really a home to it  and the graver sides of life  the deaths  the partings  the yearnings for love  have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields 
6763,all was not sadness 
6764,the sun was shining without 
6765,the thrush sang his two syllables on the budding guelder rose 
6766,some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden straw 
6767,it was the presence of sadness at all that surprised margaret  and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness 
6768,in these english farms  if anywhere  one might see life steadily and see it whole  group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth  connect  connect without bitterness until all men are brothers 
6769,but her thoughts were interrupted by the return of miss avery s niece  and were so tranquillising that she suffered the interruption gladly 
6770,it was quicker to go out by the back door  and  after due explanations  they went out by it 
6771,the niece was now mortified by innumerable chickens  who rushed up to her feet for food  and by a shameless and maternal sow 
6772,she did not know what animals were coming to 
6773,but her gentility withered at the touch of the sweet air 
6774,the wind was rising  scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over evie s pendant 
6775,one of those delicious gales of spring  in which leaves still in bud seem to rustle  swept over the land and then fell silent 
6776,georgie  sang the thrush 
6777,cuckoo  came furtively from the cliff of pine trees 
6778,georgie  pretty georgie  and the other birds joined in with nonsense 
6779,the hedge was a half painted picture which would be finished in a few days 
6780,celandines grew on its banks  lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows  the wild rose bushes  still bearing their withered hips  showed also the promise of blossom 
6781,spring had come  clad in no classical garb  yet fairer than all springs  fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of tuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind 
6782,the two women walked up the lane full of outward civility 
6783,but margaret was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such a day  and the niece was thinking about hats 
6784,thus engaged  they reached howards end 
6785,petulant cries of auntie  severed the air 
6786,there was no reply  and the front door was locked 
6787,are you sure that miss avery is up here 
6788,asked margaret 
6789,oh  yes  mrs  wilcox  quite sure 
6790,she is here daily 
6791,margaret tried to look in through the dining room window  but the curtain inside was drawn tightly 
6792,so with the drawing room and the hall 
6793,the appearance of these curtains was familiar  yet she did not remember their being there on her other visit  her impression was that mr  bryce had taken everything away 
6794,they tried the back 
6795,here again they received no answer  and could see nothing  the kitchen window was fitted with a blind  while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them  which looked ominously like the lids of packing cases 
6796,margaret thought of her books  and she lifted up her voice also 
6797,at the first cry she succeeded 
6798,well  well  replied some one inside the house 
6799,if it isn t mrs  wilcox come at last 
6800,have you got the key  auntie 
6801,madge  go away  said miss avery  still invisible 
6802,auntie  it s mrs  wilcox  
6803,margaret supported her 
6804,your niece and i have come together 
6805,madge  go away 
6806,this is no moment for your hat 
6807,the poor woman went red 
6808,auntie gets more eccentric lately  she said nervously 
6809,miss avery  called margaret 
6810,i have come about the furniture 
6811,could you kindly let me in 
6812,yes  mrs  wilcox  said the voice  of course 
6813,but after that came silence 
6814,they called again without response 
6815,they walked round the house disconsolately 
6816,i hope miss avery is not ill  hazarded margaret 
6817,well  if you ll excuse me  said madge  perhaps i ought to be leaving you now 
6818,the servants need seeing to at the farm 
6819,auntie is so odd at times 
6820,gathering up her elegancies  she retired defeated  and  as if her departure had loosed a spring  the front door opened at once 
6821,miss avery said  well  come right in  mrs  wilcox  quite pleasantly and calmly 
6822,thank you so much  began margaret  but broke off at the sight of an umbrella stand 
6823,it was her own 
6824,come right into the hall first  said miss avery 
6825,she drew the curtain  and margaret uttered a cry of despair 
6826,for an appalling thing had happened 
6827,the hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from wickham place 
6828,the carpet had been laid  the big work table drawn up near the window  the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace  and her father s sword  this is what bewildered her particularly  had been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes 
6829,miss avery must have worked for days 
6830,i m afraid this isn t what we meant  she began 
6831,mr  wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched 
6832,for instance  these books are my brother s 
6833,we are storing them for him and for my sister  who is abroad 
6834,when you kindly undertook to look after things  we never expected you to do so much 
6835,the house has been empty long enough  said the old woman 
6836,margaret refused to argue 
6837,i dare say we didn t explain  she said civilly 
6838,it has been a mistake  and very likely our mistake 
6839,mrs  wilcox  it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years 
6840,the house is mrs  wilcox s  and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer 
6841,to help the poor decaying brain  margaret said 
6842,yes  mrs  wilcox s house  the mother of mr  charles 
6843,mistake upon mistake  said miss avery 
6844,mistake upon mistake 
6845,well  i don t know  said margaret  sitting down in one of her own chairs 
6846,i really don t know what s to be done 
6847,she could not help laughing 
6848,the other said  yes  it should be a merry house enough 
6849,i don t know  i dare say 
6850,well  thank you very much  miss avery 
6851,yes  that s all right 
6852,delightful 
6853,there is still the parlour 
6854,she went through the door opposite and drew a curtain 
6855,light flooded the drawing room furniture from wickham place 
6856,and the dining room 
6857,more curtains were drawn  more windows were flung open to the spring 
6858,then through here   miss avery continued passing and reprising through the hall 
6859,her voice was lost  but margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen blind 
6860,i ve not finished here yet  she announced  returning 
6861,there s still a deal to do 
6862,the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs  for there is no need to go into expense at hilton 
6863,it is all a mistake  repeated margaret  feeling that she must put her foot down 
6864,a misunderstanding 
6865,mr  wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end 
6866,oh  indeed 
6867,on account of his hay fever 
6868,we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex  and part of this furniture  my part  will go down there presently 
6869,she looked at miss avery intently  trying to understand the kink in her brain 
6870,here was no maundering old woman 
6871,her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous 
6872,she looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious nobility 
6873,you think that you won t come back to live here  mrs  wilcox  but you will 
6874,that remains to be seen  said margaret  smiling 
6875,we have no intention of doing so for the present 
6876,we happen to need a much larger house 
6877,circumstances oblige us to give big parties 
6878,of course  some day  one never knows  does one 
6879,miss avery retorted  some day 
6880,tcha  tcha 
6881,don t talk about some day 
6882,you are living here now 
6883,am i 
6884,you are living here  and have been for the last ten minutes  if you ask me 
6885,it was a senseless remark  but with a queer feeling of disloyalty margaret rose from her chair 
6886,she felt that henry had been obscurely censured 
6887,they went into the dining room  where the sunlight poured in upon her mother s chiffonier  and upstairs  where many an old god peeped from a new niche 
6888,the furniture fitted extraordinarily well 
6889,in the central room  over the hall  the room that helen had slept in four years ago  miss avery had placed tibby s old bassinette 
6890,the nursery  she said 
6891,margaret turned away without speaking 
6892,at last everything was seen 
6893,the kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw  but  as far as she could make out  nothing had been broken or scratched 
6894,a pathetic display of ingenuity 
6895,then they took a friendly stroll in the garden 
6896,it had gone wild since her last visit 
6897,the gravel sweep was weedy  and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage 
6898,and evie s rockery was only bumps 
6899,perhaps evie was responsible for miss avery s oddness 
6900,but margaret suspected that the because lay deeper  and that the girl s silly letter had but loosed the irritation of years 
6901,it s a beautiful meadow  she remarked 
6902,it was one of those open air drawing rooms that have been formed  hundreds of years ago  out of the smaller fields 
6903,so the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles  and at the bottom there was a little green annex  a sort of powder closet for the cows 
6904,yes  the maidy s well enough  said miss avery  for those  that is  who don t suffer from sneezing 
6905,and she cackled maliciously 
6906,i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time  oh  they ought to do this  they mustn t do that  he d learn them to be lads  and just then the tickling took him  he has it from his father  with other things  there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june  i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth 
6907,my brother gets hay fever too  said margaret 
6908,this house lies too much on the land for them 
6909,naturally  they were glad enough to slip in at first 
6910,but wilcoxes are better than nothing  as i see you ve found 
6911,margaret laughed 
6912,they keep a place going  don t they 
6913,yes  it is just that 
6914,they keep england going  it is my opinion 
6915,but miss avery upset her by replying  ay  they breed like rabbits 
6916,well  well  it s a funny world 
6917,but he who made it knows what he wants in it  i suppose 
6918,if mrs  charlie is expecting her fourth  it isn t for us to repine 
6919,they breed and they also work  said margaret  conscious of some invitation to disloyalty  which was echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds 
6920,it certainly is a funny world  but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it  i think it ll never be a bad one  never really bad 
6921,no  better n nothing  said miss avery  and turned to the wych elm 
6922,on their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more clearly than before 
6923,in the house margaret had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife from the second 
6924,now she said  i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died  but we stayed civil 
6925,it was a very civil family 
6926,old mrs  howard never spoke against anybody  nor let any one be turned away without food 
6927,then it was never trespassers will be prosecuted in their land  but would people please not come in 
6928,mrs  howard was never created to run a farm 
6929,had they no men to help them 
6930,margaret asked 
6931,miss avery replied  things went on until there were no men 
6932,until mr  wilcox came along  corrected margaret  anxious that her husband should receive his dues 
6933,i suppose so  but ruth should have married a  no disrespect to you to say this  for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way  whether she got him first or no 
6934,whom should she have married 
6935,a soldier  exclaimed the old woman 
6936,some real soldier 
6937,margaret was silent 
6938,it was a criticism of henry s character far more trenchant than any of her own 
6939,she felt dissatisfied 
6940,but that s all over  she went on 
6941,a better time is coming now  though you ve kept me long enough waiting 
6942,in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening 
6943,have you ordered in coals 
6944,we are not coming  said margaret firmly 
6945,she respected miss avery too much to humour her 
6946,not coming 
6947,never coming 
6948,it has all been a mistake 
6949,the furniture must be repacked at once  and i am very sorry  but i am making other arrangements  and must ask you to give me the keys 
6950,certainly  mrs  wilcox  said miss avery  and resigned her duties with a smile 
6951,relieved at this conclusion  and having sent her compliments to madge  margaret walked back to the station 
6952,she had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal  but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected  so she decided to consult henry 
6953,it was as well that she did this 
6954,he was strongly against employing the local man whom he had previously recommended  and advised her to store in london after all 
6955,but before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her 
6956,it was not unexpected entirely 
6957,aunt juley s health had been bad all winter 
6958,she had had a long series of colds and coughs  and had been too busy to get rid of them 
6959,she had scarcely promised her niece to really take my tiresome chest in hand  when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia 
6960,margaret and tibby went down to swanage 
6961,helen was telegraphed for  and that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories 
6962,on a perfect day  when the sky seemed blue porcelain  and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand  margaret hurried up through the rhododendrons  confronted again by the senselessness of death 
6963,one death may explain itself  but it throws no light upon another  the groping inquiry must begin anew 
6964,preachers or scientists may generalise  but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love  not one heaven awaits them  not even one oblivion 
6965,aunt juley  incapable of tragedy  slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so long 
6966,she was very weak  she could not rise to the occasion  or realise the great mystery which all agree must await her  it only seemed to her that she was quite done up  more done up than ever before  that she saw and heard and felt less every moment  and that  unless something changed  she would soon feel nothing 
6967,her spare strength she devoted to plans  could not margaret take some steamer expeditions 
6968,were mackerel cooked as tibby liked them 
6969,she worried herself about helen s absence  and also that she should be the because of helen s return 
6970,the nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural  and perhaps hers was an average approach to the great gate 
6971,but margaret saw death stripped of any false romance  whatever the idea of death may contain  the process can be trivial and hideous 
6972,important  margaret dear  take the lulworth when helen comes 
6973,helen won t be able to stop  aunt juley 
6974,she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you 
6975,she must go back to germany as soon as you are well 
6976,how very odd of helen 
6977,mr  wilcox  
6978,yes  dear 
6979,can he spare you 
6980,henry wished her to come  and had been very kind 
6981,yet again margaret said so 
6982,mrs  munt did not die 
6983,quite outside her will  a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope 
6984,she returned  without emotion  as fidgety as ever 
6985,on the fourth day she was out of danger 
6986,margaret  important  it went on  i should like you to have some companion to take walks with 
6987,do try miss conder 
6988,i have been for a little walk with miss conder 
6989,but she is not really interesting 
6990,if only you had helen 
6991,i have tibby  aunt juley 
6992,no  but he has to do his chinese 
6993,some real companion is what you need 
6994,really  helen is odd 
6995,helen is odd  very  agreed margaret 
6996,not content with going abroad  why does she want to go back there at once 
6997,no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us 
6998,she has not the least balance 
6999,that was the stock criticism about helen  but margaret s voice trembled as she made it 
7000,by now she was deeply pained at her sister s behaviour 
7001,it may be unbalanced to fly out of england  but to stay away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head 
7002,a sick bed could recall helen  but she was deaf to more human calls  after a glimpse at her aunt  she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante 
7003,she scarcely existed  her letters had become dull and infrequent  she had no wants and no curiosity 
7004,and it was all put down to poor henry s account 
7005,henry  long pardoned by his wife  was still too infamous to be greeted by his sister in law 
7006,it was morbid  and  to her alarm  margaret fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in helen s life for nearly four years 
7007,the flight from oniton  the unbalanced patronage of the basts  the explosion of grief up on the downs  all connected with paul  an insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time  margaret and mrs  wilcox had feared that they might kiss again  foolishly  the real danger was reaction 
7008,reaction against the wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane 
7009,at twenty five she had an idee fixe 
7010,what hope was there for her as an old woman 
7011,the more margaret thought about it the more alarmed she became 
7012,for many months she had put the subject away  but it was too big to be slighted now 
7013,there was almost a taint of madness 
7014,were all helen s actions to be governed by a tiny mishap  such as may happen to any young man or woman 
7015,can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant 
7016,the blundering little encounter at howards end was vital 
7017,it propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren  it was stronger than sisterly intimacy  stronger than reason or books 
7018,in one of her moods helen had confessed that she still enjoyed it in a certain sense 
7019,paul had faded  but the magic of his caress endured 
7020,and where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction  propagation at both ends 
7021,well  it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed beds  and we without power to choose the seed 
7022,but man is an odd  sad creature as yet  intent on pilfering the earth  and heedless of the growths within himself 
7023,he cannot be bored about psychology 
7024,he leaves it to the specialist  which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam engine 
7025,he cannot be bothered to digest his own soul 
7026,margaret and helen have been more patient  and it is suggested that margaret has succeeded  so far as success is yet possible 
7027,she does understand herself  she has some rudimentary control over her own growth 
7028,whether helen has succeeded one cannot say 
7029,the day that mrs  munt rallied helen s letter arrived 
7030,she had posted it at munich  and would be in london herself on the morrow 
7031,it was a disquieting letter  though the opening was affectionate and sane 
7032,dearest meg 
7033,give helen s love to aunt juley 
7034,tell her that i love  and have loved her ever since i can remember 
7035,i shall be in london thursday 
7036,my address will be care of the bankers 
7037,i have not yet settled on a hotel  so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news 
7038,if aunt juley is much better  or if  for a terrible reason  it would be no good my coming down to swanage  you must not think it odd if i do not come 
7039,i have all sorts of plans in my head 
7040,i am living abroad at present  and want to get back as quickly as possible 
7041,will you please tell me where our furniture is 
7042,i should like to take out one or two books  the rest are for you 
7043,forgive me  dearest meg 
7044,this must read like rather a tiresome letter  but all letters are from your loving
7045,helen 
7046,it was a tiresome letter  for it tempted margaret to tell a lie 
7047,if she wrote that aunt juley was still in danger her sister would come 
7048,unhealthiness is contagious 
7049,we cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating 
7050,to act for the best might do helen good  but would do herself harm  and  at the risk of disaster  she kept her colours flying a little longer 
7051,she replied that their aunt was much better  and awaited developments 
7052,tibby approved of her reply 
7053,mellowing rapidly  he was a pleasanter companion than before 
7054,oxford had done much for him 
7055,he had lost his peevishness  and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food 
7056,but he had not grown more human 
7057,the years between eighteen and twenty two  so magical for most  were leading him gently from boyhood to middle age 
7058,he had never known young manliness  that quality which warms the heart till death  and gives mr  wilcox an imperishable charm 
7059,he was frigid  through no fault of his own  and without cruelty 
7060,he thought helen wrong and margaret right  but the family trouble was for him what a scene behind footlights is for most people 
7061,he had only one suggestion to make  and that was characteristic 
7062,why don t you tell mr  wilcox 
7063,about helen 
7064,perhaps he has come across that sort of thing 
7065,he would do all he could  but  
7066,oh  you know best 
7067,but he is practical 
7068,it was the student s belief in experts 
7069,margaret demurred for one or two reasons 
7070,presently helen s answer came 
7071,she sent a telegram requesting the address of the furniture  as she would now return at once 
7072,margaret replied  certainly not  meet me at the bankers at four 
7073,she and tibby went up to london 
7074,helen was not at the bankers   and they were refused her address 
7075,helen had passed into chaos 
7076,margaret put her arm round her brother 
7077,he was all that she had left  and never had he seemed more unsubstantial 
7078,tibby love  what next 
7079,he replied  it is extraordinary 
7080,dear  your judgment s often clearer than mine 
7081,have you any notion what s at the back 
7082,none  unless it s something mental 
7083,oh  that  said margaret  quite impossible  but the suggestion had been uttered  and in a few minutes she took it up herself  nothing else explained  and london agreed with tibby  the mask fell off the city  and she saw it for what it really is  a caricature of infinity 
7084,the familiar barriers  the streets along which she moved  the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years  became negligible suddenly 
7085,helen seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly flowing slabs of mud 
7086,she had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the one 
7087,margaret s own faith held firm 
7088,she knew the human soul will be merged  if it be merged at all  with the stars and the sea 
7089,yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years 
7090,it was symbolic the catastrophe should come now  on a london afternoon  while rain fell slowly 
7091,henry was the only hope 
7092,henry was definite 
7093,he might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them  and she determined to take tibby s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands 
7094,they must call at his office 
7095,he could not well make it worse 
7096,she went for a few moments into st  paul s  whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely  as if preaching the gospel of form 
7097,but within  st  paul s is as its surroundings  echoes and whispers  inaudible songs  invisible mosaics  wet footmarks  crossing and recrossing the floor 
7098,si monumentum requiris  circumspice  it points us back to london 
7099,there was no hope of helen here 
7100,henry was unsatisfactory at first 
7101,that she had expected 
7102,he was overjoyed to see her back from swanage  and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble 
7103,when they told him of their search  he only chaffed tibby and the schlegels generally  and declared that it was just like helen to lead her relatives a dance 
7104,that is what we all say  replied margaret 
7105,but why should it be just like helen 
7106,why should she be allowed to be so queer  and to grow queerer 
7107,don t ask me  i m a plain man of business 
7108,i live and let live 
7109,my advice to you both is  don t worry 
7110,margaret  you ve got black marks again under your eyes 
7111,you know that s strictly forbidden 
7112,first your aunt  then your sister 
7113,no  we aren t going to have it 
7114,are we  theobald 
7115,he rang the bell 
7116,i ll give you some tea  and then you go straight to ducie street 
7117,i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband 
7118,all the same  you have not quite seen our point  said tibby 
7119,mr  wilcox  who was in good spirits  retorted  i don t suppose i ever shall 
7120,he leant back  laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family  while the fire flickered over the map of africa 
7121,margaret motioned to her brother to go on 
7122,rather diffident  he obeyed her 
7123,margaret s point is this  he said 
7124,our sister may be mad 
7125,charles  who was working in the inner room  looked round 
7126,come in  charles  said margaret kindly 
7127,could you help us at all 
7128,we are again in trouble 
7129,i m afraid i cannot 
7130,what are the facts 
7131,we are all mad more or less  you know  in these days 
7132,the facts are as follows  replied tibby  who had at times a pedantic lucidity 
7133,the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us 
7134,she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address 
7135,she refuses to answer questions 
7136,margaret finds her letters colourless 
7137,there are other facts  but these are the most striking 
7138,she has never behaved like this before  then 
7139,asked henry 
7140,of course not  said his wife  with a frown 
7141,well  my dear  how am i to know 
7142,a senseless spasm of annoyance came over her 
7143,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection  she said 
7144,you must have noticed that much in her  surely 
7145,oh yes  she and i have always hit it off together 
7146,no  henry  can t you see   i don t mean that 
7147,she recovered herself  but not before charles had observed her 
7148,stupid and attentive  he was watching the scene 
7149,i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past  one could trace it back to the heart in the long run 
7150,she behaved oddly because she cared for some one  or wanted to help them 
7151,there s no possible excuse for her now 
7152,she is grieving us deeply  and that is why i am sure that she is not well 
7153,mad is too terrible a word  but she is not well 
7154,i shall never believe it 
7155,i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well  trouble you about her  i mean 
7156,henry began to grow serious 
7157,ill health was to him something perfectly definite 
7158,generally well himself  he could not realise that we sink to it by slow gradations 
7159,the sick had no rights  they were outside the pale  one could lie to them remorselessly 
7160,when his first wife was seized  he had promised to take her down into hertfordshire  but meanwhile arranged with a nursing home instead 
7161,helen  too  was ill 
7162,and the plan that he sketched out for her capture  clever and well meaning as it was  drew its ethics from the wolf pack 
7163,you want to get hold of her 
7164,he said 
7165,that s the problem  isn t it 
7166,she has got to see a doctor 
7167,for all i know she has seen one already 
7168,yes  yes  don t interrupt 
7169,he rose to his feet and thought intently 
7170,the genial  tentative host disappeared  and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of greece and africa  and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin 
7171,i ve got it  he said at last 
7172,it s perfectly easy 
7173,leave it to me 
7174,we ll send her down to howards end 
7175,how will you do that 
7176,after her books 
7177,tell her that she must unpack them herself 
7178,then you can meet her there 
7179,but  henry  that s just what she won t let me do 
7180,it s part of her  whatever it is  never to see me 
7181,of course you won t tell her you re going 
7182,when she is there  looking at the cases  you ll just stroll in 
7183,if nothing is wrong with her  so much the better 
7184,but there ll be the motor round the corner  and we can run her to a specialist in no time 
7185,margaret shook her head 
7186,it s quite impossible 
7187,why 
7188,it doesn t seem impossible to me  said tibby  it is surely a very tippy plan 
7189,it is impossible  because   she looked at her husband sadly 
7190,it s not the particular language that helen and i talk  if you see my meaning 
7191,it would do splendidly for other people  whom i don t blame 
7192,but helen doesn t talk  said tibby 
7193,that s our whole difficulty 
7194,she won t talk your particular language  and on that account you think she s ill 
7195,no  henry  it s sweet of you  but i couldn t 
7196,i see  he said  you have scruples 
7197,i suppose so 
7198,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer 
7199,you could have got her down to swanage by a word  but you had scruples 
7200,and scruples are all very well 
7201,i am as scrupulous as any man alive  i hope  but when it is a case like this  when there is a question of madness  
7202,i deny it s madness 
7203,you said just now  
7204,it s madness when i say it  but not when you say it 
7205,henry shrugged his shoulders 
7206,margaret 
7207,margaret  he groaned 
7208,no education can teach a woman logic 
7209,now  my dear  my time is valuable 
7210,do you want me to help you or not 
7211,not in that way 
7212,answer my question 
7213,plain question  plain answer 
7214,charles surprised them by interrupting 
7215,pater  we may as well keep howards end out of it  he said 
7216,why  charles 
7217,charles could give no reason  but margaret felt as if  over tremendous distance  a salutation had passed between them 
7218,the whole house is at sixes and sevens  he said crossly 
7219,we don t want any more mess 
7220,who s we  
7221,asked his father 
7222,my boy  pray who s we  
7223,i am sure i beg your pardon  said charles 
7224,i appear always to be intruding 
7225,by now margaret wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her husband 
7226,retreat was impossible 
7227,he was determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion  and helen faded as he talked 
7228,her fair  flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing  for she was ill  without rights  and any of her friends might hunt her 
7229,sick at heart  margaret joined in the chase 
7230,she wrote her sister a lying letter  at her husband s dictation  she said the furniture was all at howards end  but could be seen on monday next at p m   when a charwoman would be in attendance 
7231,it was a cold letter  and the more plausible for that 
7232,helen would think she was offended 
7233,and on monday next she and henry were to lunch with dolly  and then ambush themselves in the garden 
7234,after they had gone  mr  wilcox said to his son  i can t have this sort of behaviour  my boy 
7235,margaret s too sweet natured to mind  but i mind for her 
7236,charles made no answer 
7237,is anything wrong with you  charles  this afternoon 
7238,no  pater  but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon 
7239,how 
7240,don t ask me 
7241,one speaks of the moods of spring  but the days that are her true children have only one mood  they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds  and the whistling of birds 
7242,new flowers may come out  the green embroidery of the hedges increase  but the same heaven broods overhead  soft  thick  and blue  the same figures  seen and unseen  are wandering by coppice and meadow 
7243,the morning that margaret had spent with miss avery  and the afternoon she set out to entrap helen  were the scales of a single balance 
7244,time might never have moved  rain never have fallen  and man alone  with his schemes and ailments  was troubling nature until he saw her through a veil of tears 
7245,she protested no more 
7246,whether henry was right or wrong  he was most kind  and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him 
7247,she must trust him absolutely 
7248,as soon as he had taken up a business  his obtuseness vanished 
7249,he profited by the slightest indications  and the capture of helen promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of evie 
7250,they went down in the morning as arranged  and he discovered that their victim was actually in hilton 
7251,on his arrival he called at all the livery stables in the village  and had a few minutes serious conversation with the proprietors 
7252,what he said  margaret did not know  perhaps not the truth  but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the london train  and had taken a fly to howards end 
7253,she was bound to drive  said henry 
7254,there will be her books 
7255,i cannot make it out  said margaret for the hundredth time 
7256,finish your coffee  dear 
7257,we must be off 
7258,yes  margaret  you know you must take plenty  said dolly 
7259,margaret tried  but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes 
7260,dolly stole glances at her father in law which he did not answer 
7261,in the silence the motor came round to the door 
7262,you re not fit for it  he said anxiously 
7263,let me go alone 
7264,i know exactly what to do 
7265,oh yes  i am fit  said margaret  uncovering her face 
7266,only most frightfully worried 
7267,i cannot feel that helen is really alive 
7268,her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else 
7269,her voice isn t in them 
7270,i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station 
7271,i wish i d never mentioned it 
7272,i know that charles is vexed 
7273,yes  he is   she seized dolly s hand and kissed it 
7274,there  dolly will forgive me 
7275,there 
7276,now we ll be off 
7277,henry had been looking at her closely 
7278,he did not like this breakdown 
7279,don t you want to tidy yourself 
7280,he asked 
7281,have i time 
7282,yes  plenty 
7283,she went to the lavatory by the front door  and as soon as the bolt slipped  mr  wilcox said quietly 
7284,dolly  i m going without her 
7285,dolly s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement 
7286,she followed him on tiptoe out to the car 
7287,tell her i thought it best 
7288,yes  mr  wilcox  i see 
7289,say anything you like 
7290,all right 
7291,the car started well  and with ordinary luck would have got away 
7292,but porgly woggles  who was playing in the garden  chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the path 
7293,crane  in trying to pass him  ran one wheel over a bed of wallflowers 
7294,dolly screamed 
7295,margaret  hearing the noise  rushed out hatless  and was in time to jump on the footboard 
7296,she said not a single word  he was only treating her as she had treated helen  and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what helen would feel against them 
7297,she thought  i deserve it  i am punished for lowering my colours 
7298,and she accepted his apologies with a calmness that astonished him 
7299,i still consider you are not fit for it  he kept saying 
7300,perhaps i was not at lunch 
7301,but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now 
7302,i was meaning to act for the best 
7303,just lend me your scarf  will you 
7304,this wind takes one s hair so 
7305,certainly  dear girl 
7306,are you all right now 
7307,look 
7308,my hands have stopped trembling 
7309,and have quite forgiven me 
7310,then listen 
7311,her cab should already have arrived at howards end 
7312, we re a little late  but no matter  
7313,our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm  as  if possible  one doesn t want a scene before servants 
7314,a certain gentleman   he pointed at crane s back   won t drive in  but will wait a little short of the front gate  behind the laurels 
7315,have you still the keys of the house 
7316,yes 
7317,well  they aren t wanted 
7318,do you remember how the house stands 
7319,yes 
7320,if we don t find her in the porch  we can stroll round into the garden 
7321,our object  
7322,here they stopped to pick up the doctor 
7323,i was just saying to my wife  mansbridge  that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel 
7324,the house  as you know  is my property  so it should seem quite natural for us to be there 
7325,the trouble is evidently nervous  wouldn t you say so  margaret 
7326,the doctor  a very young man  began to ask questions about helen 
7327,was she normal 
7328,was there anything congenital or hereditary 
7329,had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family 
7330,nothing  answered margaret  wondering what would have happened if she had added  though she did resent my husband s immorality 
7331,she always was highly strung  pursued henry  leaning back in the car as it shot past the church 
7332,a tendency to spiritualism and those things  though nothing serious 
7333,musical  literary  artistic  but i should say normal  a very charming girl 
7334,margaret s anger and terror increased every moment 
7335,how dare these men label her sister 
7336,what horrors lay ahead 
7337,what impertinences that shelter under the name of science 
7338,the pack was turning on helen  to deny her human rights  and it seemed to margaret that all schlegels were threatened with her 
7339,were they normal 
7340,what a question to ask 
7341,and it is always those who know nothing about human nature  who are bored by psychology  and shocked by physiology  who ask it 
7342,however piteous her sister s state  she knew that she must be on her side 
7343,they would be mad together if the world chose to consider them so 
7344,it was now five minutes past three 
7345,the car slowed down by the farm  in the yard of which miss avery was standing 
7346,henry asked her whether a cab had gone past 
7347,she nodded  and the next moment they caught sight of it  at the end of the lane 
7348,the car ran silently like a beast of prey 
7349,so unsuspicious was helen that she was sitting in the porch  with her back to the road 
7350,she had come 
7351,only her head and shoulders were visible 
7352,she sat framed in the vine  and one of her hands played with the buds 
7353,the wind ruffled her hair  the sun glorified it  she was as she had always been 
7354,margaret was seated next to the door 
7355,before her husband could prevent her  she slipped out 
7356,she ran to the garden gate  which was shut  passed through it  and deliberately pushed it in his face 
7357,the noise alarmed helen 
7358,margaret saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement  and  rushing into the porch  learnt the simple explanation of all their fears  her sister was with child 
7359,is the truant all right 
7360,called henry 
7361,she had time to whisper  oh  my darling   the keys of the house were in her hand 
7362,she unlocked howards end and thrust helen into it 
7363,yes  all right  she said  and stood with her back to the door 
7364,margaret  you look upset  said henry 
7365,mansbridge had followed 
7366,crane was at the gate  and the flyman had stood up on the box 
7367,margaret shook her head at them  she could not speak any more 
7368,she remained clutching the keys  as if all their future depended on them 
7369,henry was asking more questions 
7370,she shook her head again 
7371,his words had no sense 
7372,she heard him wonder why she had let helen in 
7373,you might have given me a knock with the gate  was another of his remarks 
7374,presently she heard herself speaking 
7375,she  or someone for her  said  go away 
7376,henry came nearer 
7377,he repeated  margaret  you look upset again 
7378,my dear  give me the keys 
7379,what are you doing with helen 
7380,oh  dearest  do go away  and i will manage it all 
7381,manage what 
7382,he stretched out his hand for the keys 
7383,she might have obeyed if it had not been for the doctor 
7384,stop that at least  she said piteously  the doctor had turned back  and was questioning the driver of helen s cab 
7385,a new feeling came over her  she was fighting for women against men 
7386,she did not care about rights  but if men came into howards end  it should be over her body 
7387,come  this is an odd beginning  said her husband 
7388,the doctor came forward now  and whispered two words to mr  wilcox  the scandal was out 
7389,sincerely horrified  henry stood gazing at the earth 
7390,i cannot help it  said margaret 
7391,do wait 
7392,it s not my fault 
7393,please all four of you go away now 
7394,now the flyman was whispering to crane 
7395,we are relying on you to help us  mrs  wilcox  said the young doctor 
7396,could you go in and persuade your sister to come out 
7397,on what grounds 
7398,said margaret  suddenly looking him straight in the eyes 
7399,thinking it professional to prevaricate  he murmured something about a nervous breakdown 
7400,i beg your pardon  but it is nothing of the sort 
7401,you are not qualified to attend my sister  mr  mansbridge 
7402,if we require your services  we will let you know 
7403,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish  he retorted 
7404,you could  but you have not 
7405,you are  therefore  not qualified to attend my sister 
7406,come  come  margaret  said henry  never raising his eyes 
7407,this is a terrible business  an appalling business 
7408,it s doctor s orders 
7409,open the door 
7410,forgive me  but i will not 
7411,i don t agree 
7412,margaret was silent 
7413,this business is as broad as it s long  contributed the doctor 
7414,we had better all work together 
7415,you need us  mrs  wilcox  and we need you 
7416,quite so  said henry 
7417,i do not need you in the least  said margaret 
7418,the two men looked at each other anxiously 
7419,no more does my sister  who is still many weeks from her confinement 
7420,margaret  margaret 
7421,well  henry  send your doctor away 
7422,what possible use is he now 
7423,mr  wilcox ran his eye over the house 
7424,he had a vague feeling that he must stand firm and support the doctor 
7425,he himself might need support  for there was trouble ahead 
7426,it all turns on affection now  said margaret 
7427,affection 
7428,don t you see 
7429,resuming her usual methods  she wrote the word on the house with her finger 
7430,surely you see 
7431,i like helen very much  you not so much 
7432,mr  mansbridge doesn t know her 
7433,that s all 
7434,and affection  when reciprocated  gives rights 
7435,put that down in your note book  mr  mansbridge 
7436,it s a useful formula 
7437,henry told her to be calm 
7438,you don t know what you want yourselves  said margaret  folding her arms 
7439,for one sensible remark i will let you in 
7440,but you cannot make it 
7441,you would trouble my sister for no reason 
7442,i will not permit it 
7443,i ll stand here all the day sooner 
7444,mansbridge  said henry in a low voice  perhaps not now 
7445,the pack was breaking up 
7446,at a sign from his master  crane also went back into the car 
7447,now  henry  you  she said gently 
7448,none of her bitterness had been directed at him 
7449,go away now  dear 
7450,i shall want your advice later  no doubt 
7451,forgive me if i have been cross 
7452,but  seriously  you must go 
7453,he was too stupid to leave her 
7454,now it was mr  mansbridge who called in a low voice to him 
7455,i shall soon find you down at dolly s  she called  as the gate at last clanged between them 
7456,the fly moved out of the way  the motor backed  turned a little  backed again  and turned in the narrow road 
7457,a string of farm carts came up in the middle  but she waited through all  for there was no hurry 
7458,when all was over and the car had started  she opened the door 
7459,oh  my darling  she said 
7460,my darling  forgive me 
7461,helen was standing in the hall 
7462,margaret bolted the door on the inside 
7463,then she would have kissed her sister  but helen  in a dignified voice  that came strangely from her  said 
7464,convenient 
7465,you did not tell me that the books were unpacked 
7466,i have found nearly everything that i want 
7467,i told you nothing that was true 
7468,it has been a great surprise  certainly 
7469,has aunt juley been ill 
7470,helen  you wouldn t think i d invent that 
7471,i suppose not  said helen  turning away  and crying a very little 
7472,but one loses faith in everything after this 
7473,we thought it was illness  but even then  i haven t behaved worthily 
7474,helen selected another book 
7475,i ought not to have consulted any one 
7476,what would our father have thought of me 
7477,she did not think of questioning her sister  or of rebuking her 
7478,both might be necessary in the future  but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that helen could have committed  that want of confidence that is the work of the devil 
7479,yes  i am annoyed  replied helen 
7480,my wishes should have been respected 
7481,i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary  but after aunt juley recovered  it was not necessary 
7482,planning my life  as i now have to do 
7483,come away from those books  called margaret 
7484,helen  do talk to me 
7485,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard 
7486,one can t go through a great deal of      she left out the noun   without planning one s actions in advance 
7487,i am going to have a child in june  and in the first place conversations  discussions  excitement  are not good for me  i will go through them if necessary  but only then 
7488,in the second place i have no right to trouble people 
7489,i cannot fit in with england as i know it 
7490,i have done something that the english never pardon 
7491,it would not be right for them to pardon it 
7492,so i must live where i am not known 
7493,but why didn t you tell me  dearest 
7494,yes  replied helen judicially 
7495,i might have  but decided to wait 
7496,i believe you would never have told me 
7497,oh yes  i should 
7498,we have taken a flat in munich 
7499,margaret glanced out of the window 
7500,by we i mean myself and monica 
7501,but for her  i am and have been and always wish to be alone 
7502,i have not heard of monica 
7503,you wouldn t have 
7504,she s an italian  by birth at least 
7505,she makes her living by journalism 
7506,i met her originally on garda 
7507,monica is much the best person to see me through 
7508,you are very fond of her  then 
7509,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me 
7510,margaret guessed at monica s type   italiano inglesiato they had named it  the crude feminist of the south  whom one respects but avoids 
7511,and helen had turned to it in her need 
7512,you must not think that we shall never meet  said helen  with a measured kindness 
7513,i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared  and the longer you can be with me the better 
7514,but you haven t understood yet  meg  and of course it is very difficult for you 
7515,this is a shock to you 
7516,it isn t to me  who have been thinking over our futures for many months  and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps  such as this 
7517,i cannot live in england 
7518,helen  you ve not forgiven me for my treachery 
7519,you couldn t talk like this to me if you had 
7520,oh  meg dear  why do we talk at all 
7521,she dropped a book and sighed wearily 
7522,then  recovering herself  she said  tell me  how is it that all the books are down here 
7523,series of mistakes 
7524,and a great deal of furniture has been unpacked 
7525,all 
7526,who lives here  then 
7527,no one 
7528,i suppose you are letting it  though 
7529,the house is dead  said margaret  with a frown 
7530,why worry on about it 
7531,but i am interested 
7532,you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life 
7533,i am still helen  i hope 
7534,now this hasn t the feel of a dead house 
7535,the hall seems more alive even than in the old days  when it held the wilcoxes own things 
7536,interested  are you 
7537,very well  i must tell you  i suppose 
7538,my husband lent it on condition we  but by a mistake all our things were unpacked  and miss avery  instead of   she stopped 
7539,look here  i can t go on like this 
7540,i warn you i won t 
7541,helen  why should you be so miserably unkind to me  simply because you hate henry 
7542,i don t hate him now  said helen 
7543,i have stopped being a schoolgirl  and  meg  once again  i m not being unkind 
7544,but as for fitting in with your english life  no  put it out of your head at once 
7545,imagine a visit from me at ducie street 
7546,it s unthinkable 
7547,margaret could not contradict her 
7548,it was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans  not bitter or excitable  neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt  merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her 
7549,she had been through  how much 
7550,margaret did not know 
7551,but it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends 
7552,tell me about yourself  said helen  who had chosen her books  and was lingering over the furniture 
7553,there s nothing to tell 
7554,but your marriage has been happy  meg 
7555,yes  but i don t feel inclined to talk 
7556,you feel as i do 
7557,not that  but i can t 
7558,no more can i 
7559,it is a nuisance  but no good trying 
7560,something had come between them 
7561,perhaps it was society  which henceforward would exclude helen 
7562,perhaps it was a third life  already potent as a spirit 
7563,they could find no meeting place 
7564,both suffered acutely  and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived 
7565,look here  meg  is the coast clear 
7566,you mean that you want to go away from me 
7567,i suppose so  dear old lady  it isn t any use 
7568,i knew we should have nothing to say 
7569,give my love to aunt juley and tibby  and take more yourself than i can say 
7570,promise to come and see me in munich later 
7571,certainly  dearest 
7572,for that is all we can do 
7573,it seemed so 
7574,most ghastly of all was helen s common sense  monica had been extraordinarily good for her 
7575,i am glad to have seen you and the things 
7576,she looked at the bookcase lovingly  as if she was saying farewell to the past 
7577,margaret unbolted the door 
7578,she remarked  the car has gone  and here s your cab 
7579,she led the way to it  glancing at the leaves and the sky 
7580,the spring had never seemed more beautiful 
7581,the driver  who was leaning on the gate  called out  please  lady  a message  and handed her henry s visiting card through the bars 
7582,how did this come 
7583,she asked 
7584,crane had returned with it almost at once 
7585,she read the card with annoyance 
7586,it was covered with instructions in domestic french 
7587,when she and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to dolly s 
7588,il faut dormir sur ce sujet 
7589,while helen was to be found une comfortable chambre a l hotel 
7590,the final sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the charles s had only one spare room  and so could not invite a third guest 
7591,henry would have done what he could  she interpreted 
7592,helen had not followed her into the garden 
7593,the door once open  she lost her inclination to fly 
7594,she remained in the hall  going from bookcase to table 
7595,she grew more like the old helen  irresponsible and charming 
7596,this is mr  wilcox s house 
7597,she inquired 
7598,surely you remember howards end 
7599,remember 
7600,i who remember everything 
7601,but it looks to be ours now 
7602,miss avery was extraordinary  said margaret  her own spirits lightening a little 
7603,again she was invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty 
7604,but it brought her relief  and she yielded to it 
7605,she loved mrs  wilcox  and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty 
7606,in consequence here are all the library books 
7607,not all the books 
7608,she hasn t unpacked the art books  in which she may show her sense 
7609,and we never used to have the sword here 
7610,the sword looks well  though 
7611,magnificent 
7612,yes  doesn t it 
7613,where s the piano  meg 
7614,i warehoused that in london 
7615,why 
7616,nothing 
7617,curious  too  that the carpet fits 
7618,the carpet s a mistake  announced helen 
7619,i know that we had it in london  but this floor ought to be bare 
7620,it is far too beautiful 
7621,you still have a mania for under furnishing 
7622,would you care to come into the dining room before you start 
7623,there s no carpet there 
7624,they went in  and each minute their talk became more natural 
7625,oh  what a place for mother s chiffonier  cried helen 
7626,look at the chairs  though 
7627,oh  look at them 
7628,wickham place faced north  didn t it 
7629,north west 
7630,anyhow  it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun 
7631,feel 
7632,their dear little backs are quite warm 
7633,but why has miss avery made them set to partners 
7634,i shall just  
7635,over here  meg 
7636,put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn 
7637,margaret moved a chair 
7638,helen sat down in it 
7639,ye  es 
7640,the window s too high 
7641,try a drawing room chair 
7642,no  i don t like the drawing room so much 
7643,the beam has been match boarded 
7644,it would have been so beautiful otherwise 
7645,helen  what a memory you have for some things 
7646,you re perfectly right 
7647,it s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women 
7648,men don t know what we want  
7649,and never will 
7650,i don t agree 
7651,in two thousand years they ll know 
7652,look where tibby spilt the soup 
7653,coffee 
7654,it was coffee surely 
7655,helen shook her head 
7656,impossible 
7657,tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time 
7658,was father alive 
7659,yes 
7660,then you re right and it must have been soup 
7661,i was thinking of much later  that unsuccessful visit of aunt juley s  when she didn t realise that tibby had grown up  it was coffee then  for he threw it down on purpose  there was some rhyme  tea  coffee  coffee tea  that she said to him every morning at breakfast 
7662,wait a minute  how did it go 
7663,i know  no  i don t 
7664,what a detestable boy tibby was 
7665,but the rhyme was simply awful 
7666,no decent person could put up with it 
7667,ah  that greengage tree  cried helen  as if the garden was also part of their childhood 
7668,why do i connect it with dumb bells 
7669,and there come the chickens 
7670,the grass wants cutting 
7671,i love yellow hammers 
7672,margaret interrupted her 
7673,i have got it  she announced 
7674,tea  tea  coffee  tea  or chocolaritee 
7675,that every morning for three weeks 
7676,no wonder tibby was wild 
7677,tibby is moderately a dear now  said helen 
7678,there 
7679,i knew you d say that in the end 
7680,of course he s a dear 
7681,a bell rang 
7682,listen  what s that 
7683,helen said  perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege 
7684,what nonsense  listen 
7685,and the triviality faded from their faces  though it left something behind  the knowledge that they never could be parted because their love was rooted in common things 
7686,explanations and appeals had failed  they had tried for a common meeting ground  and had only made each other unhappy 
7687,and all the time their salvation was lying round them  the past sanctifying the present  the present  with wild heart throb  declaring that there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of children 
7688,helen  still smiling  came up to her sister 
7689,she said  it is always meg 
7690,they looked into each other s eyes 
7691,the inner life had paid 
7692,solemnly the clapper tolled 
7693,no one was in the front 
7694,margaret went to the kitchen  and struggled between packing cases to the window 
7695,their visitor was only a little boy with a tin can 
7696,and triviality returned 
7697,little boy  what do you want 
7698,please  i am the milk 
7699,did miss avery send you 
7700,said margaret  rather sharply 
7701,yes  please 
7702,then take it back and say we require no milk 
7703,while she called to helen  no  it s not the siege  but possibly an attempt to provision us against one 
7704,but i like milk  cried helen 
7705,why send it away 
7706,do you 
7707,oh  very well 
7708,but we ve nothing to put it in  and he wants the can 
7709,please  i m to call in the morning for the can  said the boy 
7710,the house will be locked up then 
7711,in the morning would i bring eggs too 
7712,are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week 
7713,the child hung his head 
7714,well  run away and do it again 
7715,nice little boy  whispered helen 
7716,i say  what s your name 
7717,mine s helen 
7718,tom 
7719,that was helen all over 
7720,the wilcoxes  too  would ask a child its name  but they never told their names in return 
7721,tom  this one here is margaret 
7722,and at home we ve another called tibby 
7723,mine are lop eareds  replied tom  supposing tibby to be a rabbit 
7724,you re a very good and rather a clever little boy 
7725,mind you come again   isn t he charming 
7726,undoubtedly  said margaret 
7727,he is probably the son of madge  and madge is dreadful 
7728,but this place has wonderful powers 
7729,what do you mean 
7730,i don t know 
7731,because i probably agree with you 
7732,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live 
7733,i do agree  said helen  as she sipped the milk 
7734,but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago 
7735,meaning that i was dead 
7736,i felt it 
7737,yes  the house has a surer life than we  even if it was empty  and  as it is  i can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture 
7738,after all  wickham place was a grave 
7739,meg  i ve a startling idea 
7740,what is it 
7741,drink some milk to steady you 
7742,margaret obeyed 
7743,no  i won t tell you yet  said helen  because you may laugh or be angry 
7744,let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing 
7745,they opened window after window  till the inside  too  was rustling to the spring 
7746,curtains blew  picture frames tapped cheerfully 
7747,helen uttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place  that in its wrong one 
7748,she was angry with miss avery for not having moved the wardrobes up 
7749,then one would see really 
7750,she admired the view 
7751,she was the helen who had written the memorable letters four years ago 
7752,as they leant out  looking westward  she said  about my idea 
7753,couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night 
7754,i don t think we could well do that  said margaret 
7755,here are beds  tables  towels  
7756,i know  but the house isn t supposed to be slept in  and henry s suggestion was  
7757,i require no suggestions 
7758,i shall not alter anything in my plans 
7759,but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you 
7760,it will be something to look back on 
7761,oh  meg lovey  do let s 
7762,but  helen  my pet  said margaret  we can t without getting henry s leave 
7763,of course  he would give it  but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now  and this is equally intimate 
7764,ducie street is his house 
7765,this is ours 
7766,our furniture  our sort of people coming to the door 
7767,do let us camp out  just one night  and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk 
7768,why not 
7769,it s a moon 
7770,margaret hesitated 
7771,i feel charles wouldn t like it  she said at last 
7772,even our furniture annoyed him  and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me  i sympathise with charles 
7773,he feels it s his mother s house 
7774,he loves it in rather an untaking way 
7775,henry i could answer for  not charles 
7776,i know he won t like it  said helen 
7777,but i am going to pass out of their lives 
7778,what difference will it make in the long run if they say  and she even spent the night at howards end  
7779,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives 
7780,we have thought that twice before 
7781,because my plans  
7782,  which you change in a moment 
7783,then because my life is great and theirs are little  said helen  taking fire 
7784,i know of things they can t know of  and so do you 
7785,we know that there s poetry 
7786,we know that there s death 
7787,they can only take them on hearsay 
7788,we know this is our house  because it feels ours 
7789,oh  they may take the title deeds and the door keys  but for this one night we are at home 
7790,it would be lovely to have you once more alone  said margaret 
7791,it may be a chance in a thousand 
7792,yes  and we could talk 
7793,she dropped her voice 
7794,it won t be a very glorious story 
7795,but under that wych elm  honestly  i see little happiness ahead 
7796,cannot i have this one night with you 
7797,i needn t say how much it would mean to me 
7798,then let us 
7799,it is no good hesitating 
7800,shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave 
7801,oh  we don t want leave 
7802,but margaret was a loyal wife 
7803,in spite of imagination and poetry  perhaps on account of them  she could sympathise with the technical attitude that henry would adopt 
7804,if possible  she would be technical  too 
7805,a night s lodging  and they demanded no more  need not involve the discussion of general principles 
7806,charles may say no  grumbled helen 
7807,we shan t consult him 
7808,go if you like  i should have stopped without leave 
7809,it was the touch of selfishness  which was not enough to mar helen s character  and even added to its beauty 
7810,she would have stopped without leave and escaped to germany the next morning 
7811,margaret kissed her 
7812,expect me back before dark 
7813,i am looking forward to it so much 
7814,it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing 
7815,not a thing  only an ending  said helen rather sadly  and the sense of tragedy closed in on margaret again as soon as she left the house 
7816,she was afraid of miss avery 
7817,it is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy  however superficially 
7818,she was glad to see no watching figure as she drove past the farm  but only little tom  turning somersaults in the straw 
7819,the tragedy began quietly enough  and  like many another talk  by the man s deft assertion of his superiority 
7820,henry heard her arguing with the driver  stepped out and settled the fellow  who was inclined to be rude  and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn 
7821,dolly  who had not been told  ran out with offers of tea 
7822,he refused them  and ordered them to wheel baby s perambulator away  as they desired to be alone 
7823,but the diddums can t listen  he isn t nine months old  she pleaded 
7824,that s not what i was saying  retorted her father in law 
7825,baby was wheeled out of earshot  and did not hear about the crisis till later years 
7826,it was now the turn of margaret 
7827,is it what we feared 
7828,he asked 
7829,it is 
7830,dear girl  he began  there is a troublesome business ahead of us  and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through 
7831,margaret bent her head 
7832,i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched 
7833,as you know  i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred 
7834,to speak as i must will pain me  but there are occasions  we are husband and wife  not children 
7835,i am a man of the world  and you are a most exceptional woman 
7836,all margaret s senses forsook her 
7837,she blushed  and looked past him at the six hills  covered with spring herbage 
7838,noting her colour  he grew still more kind 
7839,i see that you feel as i felt when  my poor little wife 
7840,oh  be brave 
7841,just one or two questions  and i have done with you 
7842,was your sister wearing a wedding ring 
7843,margaret stammered a no 
7844,there was an appalling silence 
7845,henry  i really came to ask a favour about howards end 
7846,one point at a time 
7847,i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer 
7848,she rose to her feet and held the chair between them 
7849,her colour had ebbed  and she was grey 
7850,it did not displease him that she should receive his question thus 
7851,take your time  he counselled her 
7852,remember that this is far worse for me than for you 
7853,she swayed  he feared she was going to faint 
7854,then speech came  and she said slowly  seducer 
7855,no  i do not know her seducer s name 
7856,would she not tell you 
7857,i never even asked her who seduced her  said margaret  dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully 
7858,that is singular 
7859,then he changed his mind 
7860,natural perhaps  dear girl  that you shouldn t ask 
7861,but until his name is known  nothing can be done 
7862,sit down 
7863,how terrible it is to see you so upset 
7864,i knew you weren t fit for it 
7865,i wish i hadn t taken you 
7866,margaret answered  i like to stand  if you don t mind  for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills 
7867,as you like 
7868,have you anything else to ask me  henry 
7869,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything 
7870,i have often noticed your insight  dear 
7871,i only wish my own was as good 
7872,you may have guessed something  even though your sister said nothing 
7873,the slightest hint would help us 
7874,who is we  
7875,i thought it best to ring up charles 
7876,that was unnecessary  said margaret  growing warmer 
7877,this news will give charles disproportionate pain 
7878,he has at once gone to call on your brother 
7879,that too was unnecessary 
7880,let me explain  dear  how the matter stands 
7881,you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen 
7882,it is in helen s interests that we are acting 
7883,it is still not too late to save her name 
7884,then margaret hit out for the first time 
7885,are we to make her seducer marry her 
7886,she asked 
7887,if possible  yes 
7888,but  henry  suppose he turned out to be married already 
7889,one has heard of such cases 
7890,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct  and be thrashed within an inch of his life 
7891,so her first blow missed 
7892,she was thankful of it 
7893,what had tempted her to imperil both of their lives 
7894,henry s obtuseness had saved her as well as himself 
7895,exhausted with anger  she sat down again  blinking at him as he told her as much as he thought fit 
7896,at last she said  may i ask you my question now 
7897,certainly  my dear 
7898,to morrow helen goes to munich  
7899,well  possibly she is right 
7900,henry  let a lady finish 
7901,to morrow she goes  to night  with your permission  she would like to sleep at howards end 
7902,it was the crisis of his life 
7903,again she would have recalled the words as soon as they were uttered 
7904,she had not led up to them with sufficient care 
7905,she longed to warn him that they were far more important than he supposed 
7906,she saw him weighing them  as if they were a business proposition 
7907,why howards end 
7908,he said at last 
7909,would she not be more comfortable  as i suggested  at the hotel 
7910,margaret hastened to give him reasons 
7911,it is an odd request  but you know what helen is and what women in her state are 
7912,he frowned  and moved irritably 
7913,she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good 
7914,i think she s right 
7915,being one of those imaginative girls  the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her 
7916,this is a fact 
7917,it is the end of her girlhood 
7918,her last words to me were  a beautiful ending 
7919,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons  in fact 
7920,exactly 
7921,you have quite understood 
7922,it is her last hope of being with it 
7923,i don t agree there  my dear 
7924,helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes  possibly more than her share  for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies  wouldn t you  and i d raise no objection  i could understand it if it was her old home  because a home  or a house  he changed the word  designedly  he had thought of a telling point   because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred  i don t know why 
7925,associations and so on 
7926,now helen has no associations with howards end  though i and charles and evie have 
7927,i do not see why she wants to stay the night there 
7928,she will only catch cold 
7929,leave it that you don t see  cried margaret 
7930,call it fancy 
7931,but realise that fancy is a scientific fact 
7932,helen is fanciful  and wants to 
7933,then he surprised her  a rare occurrence 
7934,he shot an unexpected bolt 
7935,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two 
7936,we shall never get her out of the house  perhaps 
7937,well 
7938,said margaret  with the precipice in sight 
7939,and suppose we don t get her out of the house 
7940,would it matter 
7941,she would do no one any harm 
7942,again the irritated gesture 
7943,no  henry  she panted  receding 
7944,i didn t mean that 
7945,we will only trouble howards end for this one night 
7946,i take her to london to morrow  
7947,do you intend to sleep in a damp house  too 
7948,she cannot be left alone 
7949,that s quite impossible 
7950,madness 
7951,you must be here to meet charles 
7952,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary  and i have no desire to meet him 
7953,margaret  my margaret 
7954,what has this business to do with charles 
7955,if it concerns me little  it concerns you less  and charles not at all 
7956,as the future owner of howards end  said mr  wilcox arching his fingers  i should say that it did concern charles 
7957,in what way 
7958,will helen s condition depreciate the property 
7959,my dear  you are forgetting yourself 
7960,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking 
7961,they looked at each other in amazement 
7962,the precipice was at their feet now 
7963,helen commands my sympathy  said henry 
7964,as your husband  i shall do all for her that i can  and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning 
7965,but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened 
7966,i should be false to my position in society if i did 
7967,she controlled herself for the last time 
7968,no  let us go back to helen s request  she said 
7969,it is unreasonable  but the request of an unhappy girl 
7970,tomorrow she will go to germany  and trouble society no longer 
7971,to night she asks to sleep in your empty house  a house which you do not care about  and which you have not occupied for over a year 
7972,may she 
7973,will you give my sister leave 
7974,will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven  and as you have actually been forgiven 
7975,forgive her for one night only 
7976,that will be enough 
7977,as i have actually been forgiven   
7978,never mind for the moment what i mean by that  said margaret 
7979,answer my question 
7980,perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him 
7981,if so  he blotted it out 
7982,straight from his fortress he answered  i seem rather unaccommodating  but i have some experience of life  and know how one thing leads to another 
7983,i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel 
7984,i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider 
7985,i am sorry  but see that she leaves my house at once 
7986,you have mentioned mrs  wilcox 
7987,i beg your pardon 
7988,a rare occurrence 
7989,in reply  may i mention mrs  bast 
7990,you have not been yourself all day  said henry  and rose from his seat with face unmoved 
7991,margaret rushed at him and seized both his hands 
7992,she was transfigured 
7993,not any more of this  she cried 
7994,you shall see the connection if it kills you  henry 
7995,you have had a mistress  i forgave you  my sister has a lover  you drive her from the house 
7996,do you see the connection 
7997,stupid  hypocritical  cruel  oh  contemptible   a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead 
7998,a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure  and casts her off to ruin other men 
7999,and gives bad financial advice  and then says he is not responsible 
8000,these men are you 
8001,you can t recognise them  because you cannot connect 
8002,i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness 
8003,i ve spoilt you long enough 
8004,all your life you have been spoiled 
8005,mrs  wilcox spoiled you 
8006,no one has ever told what you are  muddled  criminally muddled 
8007,men like you use repentance as a blind  so don t repent 
8008,only say to yourself  what helen has done  i ve done 
8009,the two cases are different  henry stammered 
8010,his real retort was not quite ready 
8011,his brain was still in a whirl  and he wanted a little longer 
8012,in what way different 
8013,you have betrayed mrs  wilcox  helen only herself 
8014,you remain in society  helen can t 
8015,you have had only pleasure  she may die 
8016,you have the insolence to talk to me of differences  henry 
8017,oh  the uselessness of it 
8018,henry s retort came 
8019,i perceive you are attempting blackmail 
8020,it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband 
8021,my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats  and i can only repeat what i said before  i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end 
8022,margaret loosed his hands 
8023,he went into the house  wiping first one and then the other on his handkerchief 
8024,for a little she stood looking at the six hills  tombs of warriors  breasts of the spring 
8025,then she passed out into what was now the evening 
8026,charles and tibby met at ducie street  where the latter was staying 
8027,their interview was short and absurd 
8028,they had nothing in common but the english language  and tried by its help to express what neither of them understood 
8029,charles saw in helen the family foe 
8030,he had singled her out as the most dangerous of the schlegels  and  angry as he was  looked forward to telling his wife how right he had been 
8031,his mind was made up at once  the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them farther 
8032,if occasion offered she might be married to a villain  or  possibly  to a fool 
8033,but this was a concession to morality  it formed no part of his main scheme 
8034,honest and hearty was charles s dislike  and the past spread itself out very clearly before him  hatred is a skilful compositor 
8035,as if they were heads in a note book  he ran through all the incidents of the schlegels campaign  the attempt to compromise his brother  his mother s legacy  his father s marriage  the introduction of the furniture  the unpacking of the same 
8036,he had not yet heard of the request to sleep at howards end  that was to be their master stroke and the opportunity for his 
8037,but he already felt that howards end was the objective  and  though he disliked the house  was determined to defend it 
8038,tibby  on the other hand  had no opinions 
8039,he stood above the conventions  his sister had a right to do what she thought right 
8040,it is not difficult to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages among them  men can always be more unconventional than women  and a bachelor of independent means need encounter no difficulties at all 
8041,unlike charles  tibby had money enough  his ancestors had earned it for him  and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to move into another 
8042,his was the leisure without sympathy  an attitude as fatal as the strenuous  a little cold culture may be raised on it  but no art 
8043,his sisters had seen the family danger  and had never forgotten to discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea 
8044,tibby gave all the praise to himself  and so despised the struggling and the submerged 
8045,hence the absurdity of the interview  the gulf between them was economic as well as spiritual 
8046,but several facts passed  charles pressed for them with an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand 
8047,on what date had helen gone abroad 
8048,to whom 
8049, charles was anxious to fasten the scandal on germany  
8050,then  changing his tactics  he said roughly  i suppose you realise that you are your sister s protector 
8051,in what sense 
8052,if a man played about with my sister  i d send a bullet through him  but perhaps you don t mind 
8053,i mind very much  protested tibby 
8054,who d ye suspect  then 
8055,speak out man 
8056,one always suspects some one 
8057,no one 
8058,i don t think so 
8059,involuntarily he blushed 
8060,he had remembered the scene in his oxford rooms 
8061,you are hiding something  said charles 
8062,as interviews go  he got the best of this one 
8063,when you saw her last  did she mention any one s name 
8064,yes or no  he thundered  so that tibby started 
8065,in my rooms she mentioned some friends  called the basts 
8066,who are the basts 
8067,people  friends of hers at evie s wedding 
8068,i don t remember 
8069,but  by great scott  i do 
8070,my aunt told me about some rag tag 
8071,was she full of them when you saw her 
8072,is there a man 
8073,did she speak of the man 
8074,or  look here  have you had any dealings with him 
8075,tibby was silent 
8076,without intending it  he had betrayed his sister s confidence  he was not enough interested in human life to see where things will lead to 
8077,he had a strong regard for honesty  and his word  once given  had always been kept up to now 
8078,he was deeply vexed  not only for the harm he had done helen  but for the flaw he had discovered in his own equipment 
8079,i see  you are in his confidence  they met at your rooms  oh  what a family  what a family  god help the poor pater  
8080,and tibby found himself alone 
8081,leonard  he would figure at length in a newspaper report  but that evening he did not count for much 
8082,the foot of the tree was in shadow  since the moon was still hidden behind the house 
8083,but above  to right  to left  down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming 
8084,leonard seemed not a man  but a because 
8085,perhaps it was helen s way of falling in love  a curious way to margaret  whose agony and whose contempt of henry were yet imprinted with his image 
8086,helen forgot people 
8087,they were husks that had enclosed her emotion 
8088,she could pity  or sacrifice herself  or have instincts  but had she ever loved in the noblest way  where man and woman  having lost themselves in sex  desire to lose sex itself in comradeship 
8089,margaret wondered  but said no word of blame 
8090,this was helen s evening 
8091,troubles enough lay ahead of her  the loss of friends and of social advantages  the agony  the supreme agony  of motherhood  which is not even yet a matter of common knowledge 
8092,for the present let the moon shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently  dying away from the gale of the day  and let the earth  that brings increase  bring peace 
8093,not even to herself dare she blame helen 
8094,she could not assess her trespass by any moral code  it was everything or nothing 
8095,morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing  and group most sins in an order all must approve  but it cannot group helen 
8096,the surer its pronouncements on this point  the surer may we be that morality is not speaking 
8097,christ was evasive when they questioned him 
8098,it is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone 
8099,this was helen s evening  won at what cost  and not to be marred by the sorrows of others 
8100,of her own tragedy margaret never uttered a word 
8101,one isolates  said helen slowly 
8102,i isolated mr  wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill 
8103,consequently  i was full of pity  and almost of revenge 
8104,for weeks i had blamed mr  wilcox only  and so  when your letters came  
8105,i need never have written them  sighed margaret 
8106,they never shielded henry 
8107,how hopeless it is to tidy away the past  even for others 
8108,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts 
8109,looking back  that was wrong of me 
8110,looking back  darling  i know that it was right 
8111,it is right to save the man whom one loves 
8112,i am less enthusiastic about justice now 
8113,but we both thought you wrote at his dictation 
8114,it seemed the last touch of his callousness 
8115,being very much wrought up by this time  and mrs  bast was upstairs  i had not seen her  and had talked for a long time to leonard  i had snubbed him for no reason  and that should have warned me i was in danger 
8116,so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation 
8117,he said that he guessed the explanation  he knew of it  and you mustn t know 
8118,i pressed him to tell me 
8119,he said no one must know  it was something to do with his wife 
8120,right up to the end we were mr  bast and miss schlegel 
8121,i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes  and guessed that mr  wilcox had ruined him in two ways  not one 
8122,i drew him to me  i made him tell me  i felt very lonely myself 
8123,he is not to blame 
8124,he would have gone on worshipping me  i want never to see him again  though it sounds appalling 
8125,i wanted to give him money and feel finished 
8126,oh  meg  the little that is known about these things 
8127,she laid her face against the tree 
8128,the little  too  that is known about growth 
8129,both times it was loneliness  and the night  and panic afterwards 
8130,did leonard grow out of paul 
8131,margaret did not speak for a moment 
8132,so tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the teeth  the teeth that had been thrust into the tree s bark to medicate it 
8133,from where she sat she could see them gleam 
8134,she had been trying to count them 
8135,leonard is a better growth than madness  she said 
8136,i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge 
8137,i did react until i found poor leonard 
8138,i am steady now 
8139,i shan t ever like your henry  dearest meg  or even speak kindly about him  but all that blinding hate is over 
8140,i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more 
8141,i understand how you married him  and you will now be very happy 
8142,margaret did not reply 
8143,yes  repeated helen  her voice growing more tender  i do at last understand 
8144,except mrs  wilcox  dearest  no one understands our little movements 
8145,because in death  i agree 
8146,not quite 
8147,i feel that you and i and henry are only fragments of that woman s mind 
8148,she knows everything 
8149,she is everything 
8150,she is the house  and the tree that leans over it 
8151,people have their own deaths as well as their own lives  and even if there is nothing beyond death  we shall differ in our nothingness 
8152,i cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine 
8153,she knew about realities 
8154,she knew when people were in love  though she was not in the room 
8155,i don t doubt that she knew when henry deceived her 
8156,good night  mrs  wilcox  called a voice 
8157,oh  good night  miss avery 
8158,why should miss avery work for us 
8159,helen murmured 
8160,why  indeed 
8161,miss avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided it from the farm 
8162,an old gap  which mr  wilcox had filled up  had reappeared  and her track through the dew followed the path that he had turfed over  when he improved the garden and made it possible for games 
8163,this is not quite our house yet  said helen 
8164,when miss avery called  i felt we are only a couple of tourists 
8165,we shall be that everywhere  and for ever 
8166,but affectionate tourists 
8167,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home 
8168,i can t pretend very long  said helen 
8169,sitting under this tree one forgets  but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany 
8170,not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case 
8171,unless you will come with me 
8172,margaret thought for a moment 
8173,in the past year she had grown so fond of england that to leave it was a real grief 
8174,yet what detained her 
8175,no doubt henry would pardon her outburst  and go on blustering and muddling into a ripe old age 
8176,but what was the good 
8177,she had just as soon vanish from his mind 
8178,are you serious in asking me  helen 
8179,should i get on with your monica 
8180,you would not  but i am serious in asking you 
8181,still  no more plans now 
8182,and no more reminiscences 
8183,they were silent for a little 
8184,it was helen s evening 
8185,the present flowed by them like a stream 
8186,the tree rustled 
8187,it had made music before they were born  and would continue after their deaths  but its song was of the moment 
8188,the moment had passed 
8189,the tree rustled again 
8190,their senses were sharpened  and they seemed to apprehend life 
8191,life passed 
8192,the tree rustled again 
8193,sleep now  said margaret 
8194,the peace of the country was entering into her 
8195,it has no commerce with memory  and little with hope 
8196,least of all is it concerned with the hopes of the next five minutes 
8197,it is the peace of the present  which passes understanding 
8198,its murmur came now  and now once more as they trod the gravel  and now  as the moonlight fell upon their father s sword 
8199,they passed upstairs  kissed  and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep 
8200,the house had enshadowed the tree at first  but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled  and were clear for a few moments at midnight 
8201,margaret awoke and looked into the garden 
8202,how incomprehensible that leonard bast should have won her this night of peace 
8203,was he also part of mrs  wilcox s mind 
8204,far different was leonard s development 
8205,the months after oniton  whatever minor troubles they might bring him  were all overshadowed by remorse 
8206,when helen looked back she could philosophise  or she could look into the future and plan for her child 
8207,but the father saw nothing beyond his own sin 
8208,weeks afterwards  in the midst of other occupations  he would suddenly cry out  brute  you brute  i couldn t have   and be rent into two people who held dialogues 
8209,or brown rain would descend  blotting out faces and the sky 
8210,even jacky noticed the change in him 
8211,most terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep 
8212,sometimes he was happy at first  but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing down his thoughts when they would move 
8213,or little irons scorched his body 
8214,or a sword stabbed him 
8215,he would sit at the edge of his bed  holding his heart and moaning  oh what shall i do  whatever shall i do 
8216,nothing brought ease 
8217,he could put distance between him and the trespass  but it grew in his soul 
8218,remorse is not among the eternal verities 
8219,the greeks were right to dethrone her 
8220,her action is too capricious  as though the erinyes selected for punishment only certain men and certain sins 
8221,and of all means to regeneration remorse is surely the most wasteful 
8222,it cuts away healthy tissues with the poisoned 
8223,it is a knife that probes far deeper than the evil 
8224,leonard was driven straight through its torments and emerged pure  but enfeebled  a better man  who would never lose control of himself again  but also a smaller man  who had less to control 
8225,nor did purity mean peace 
8226,the use of the knife can become a habit as hard to shake off as passion itself  and leonard continued to start with a cry out of dreams 
8227,he built up a situation that was far enough from the truth 
8228,it never occurred to him that helen was to blame 
8229,he forgot the intensity of their talk  the charm that had been lent him by sincerity  the magic of oniton under darkness and of the whispering river 
8230,helen loved the absolute 
8231,leonard had been ruined absolutely  and had appeared to her as a man apart  isolated from the world 
8232,a real man  who cared for adventure and beauty  who desired to live decently and pay his way  who could have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut car that was crushing him 
8233,memories of evie s wedding had warped her  the starched servants  the yards of uneaten food  the rustle of overdressed women  motor cars oozing grease on the gravel  a pretentious band 
8234,she had tasted the lees of this on her arrival  in the darkness  after failure  they intoxicated her 
8235,she and the victim seemed alone in a world of unreality  and she loved him absolutely  perhaps for half an hour 
8236,in the morning she was gone 
8237,the note that she left  tender and hysterical in tone  and intended to be most kind  hurt her lover terribly 
8238,it was as if some work of art had been broken by him  some picture in the national gallery slashed out of its frame 
8239,when he recalled her talents and her social position  he felt that the first passer by had a right to shoot him down 
8240,he was afraid of the waitress and the porters at the railway station 
8241,he was afraid at first of his wife  though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness  and to think  there is nothing to choose between us  after all 
8242,the expedition to shropshire crippled the basts permanently 
8243,helen in her flight forgot to settle the hotel bill  and took their return tickets away with her  they had to pawn jacky s bangles to get home  and the smash came a few days afterwards 
8244,it is true that helen offered him five thousand pounds  but such a sum meant nothing to him 
8245,he could not see that the girl was desperately righting herself  and trying to save something out of the disaster  if it was only five thousand pounds 
8246,but he had to live somehow 
8247,he turned to his family  and degraded himself to a professional beggar 
8248,there was nothing else for him to do 
8249,a letter from leonard  thought blanche  his sister  and after all this time 
8250,she hid it  so that her husband should not see  and when he had gone to his work read it with some emotion  and sent the prodigal a little money out of her dress allowance 
8251,a letter from leonard  said the other sister  laura  a few days later 
8252,she showed it to her husband 
8253,he wrote a cruel  insolent reply  but sent more money than blanche  so leonard soon wrote to him again 
8254,and during the winter the system was developed 
8255,leonard realised that they need never starve  because it would be too painful for his relatives 
8256,society is based on the family  and the clever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely 
8257,without a generous thought on either side  pounds and pounds passed 
8258,the donors disliked leonard  and he grew to hate them intensely 
8259,when laura censured his immoral marriage  he thought bitterly  she minds that 
8260,what would she say if she knew the truth 
8261,when blanche s husband offered him work  he found some pretext for avoiding it 
8262,he had wanted work keenly at oniton  but too much anxiety had shattered him  he was joining the unemployable 
8263,when his brother  the lay reader  did not reply to a letter  he wrote again  saying that he and jacky would come down to his village on foot 
8264,he did not intend this as blackmail 
8265,still the brother sent a postal order  and it became part of the system 
8266,and so passed his winter and his spring 
8267,in the horror there are two bright spots 
8268,he never confused the past 
8269,he remained alive  and blessed are those who live  if it is only to a sense of sinfulness 
8270,the anodyne of muddledom  by which most men blur and blend their mistakes  never passed leonard s lips  
8271,and if i drink oblivion of a day  so shorten i the stature of my soul 
8272,it is a hard saying  and a hard man wrote it  but it lies at the root of all character 
8273,and the other bright spot was his tenderness for jacky 
8274,he pitied her with nobility now  not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a woman through thick and thin  he tried to be less irritable  he wondered what her hungry eyes desired  nothing that she could express  or that he or any man could give her 
8275,would she ever receive the justice that is mercy  the justice for by products that the world is too busy to bestow 
8276,she was fond of flowers  generous with money  and not revengeful 
8277,if she had borne him a child he might have cared for her 
8278,unmarried  leonard would never have begged  he would have flickered out and died 
8279,but the whole of life is mixed 
8280,he had to provide for jacky  and went down dirty paths that she might have a few feathers and the dishes of food that suited her 
8281,one day he caught sight of margaret and her brother 
8282,he was in st  paul s 
8283,he had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that had educated him in former years 
8284,but the light was bad  the picture ill placed  and time and judgment were inside him now 
8285,death alone still charmed him  with her lap of poppies  on which all men shall sleep 
8286,he took one glance  and turned aimlessly away towards a chair 
8287,then down the nave he saw miss schlegel and her brother 
8288,they stood in the fairway of passengers  and their faces were extremely grave 
8289,he was perfectly certain that they were in trouble about their sister 
8290,once outside  and he fled immediately  he wished that he had spoken to them 
8291,what was his life 
8292,what were a few angry words  or even imprisonment 
8293,he had done wrong  that was the true terror 
8294,whatever they might know  he would tell them everything he knew 
8295,he re entered st  paul s 
8296,but they had moved in his absence  and had gone to lay their difficulties before mr  wilcox and charles 
8297,the sight of margaret turned remorse into new channels 
8298,he desired to confess  and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature  which is about to lose the essence of human intercourse  it did not take an ignoble form 
8299,he did not suppose that confession would bring him happiness 
8300,it was rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle 
8301,so does the suicide yearn 
8302,the impulses are akin  and the crime of suicide lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave behind 
8303,confession need harm no one  it can satisfy that test  and though it was un english  and ignored by our anglican cathedral  leonard had a right to decide upon it 
8304,moreover  he trusted margaret 
8305,he wanted her hardness now 
8306,that cold  intellectual nature of hers would be just  if unkind 
8307,he would do whatever she told him  even if he had to see helen 
8308,that was the supreme punishment she would exact 
8309,and perhaps she would tell him how helen was 
8310,that was the supreme reward 
8311,he knew nothing about margaret  not even whether she was married to mr  wilcox  and tracking her out took several days 
8312,that evening he toiled through the wet to wickham place  where the new flats were now appearing 
8313,was he also the because of their move 
8314,were they expelled from society on his account 
8315,thence to a public library  but could find no satisfactory schlegel in the directory 
8316,on the morrow he searched again 
8317,he hung about outside mr  wilcox s office at lunch time  and  as the clerks came out said  excuse me  sir  but is your boss married 
8318,most of them stared  some said  what s that to you 
8319,but one  who had not yet acquired reticence  told him what he wished 
8320,leonard could not learn the private address 
8321,that necessitated more trouble with directories and tubes 
8322,ducie street was not discovered till the monday  the day that margaret and her husband went down on their hunting expedition to howards end 
8323,he called at about four o clock 
8324,the weather had changed  and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental steps  black and white marble in triangles 
8325,leonard lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell 
8326,he felt in curious health  doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body  and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed  with his back propped against the wall 
8327,when the parlourmaid came he could not see her face  the brown rain had descended suddenly 
8328,does mrs  wilcox live here 
8329,he asked 
8330,she s out  was the answer 
8331,when will she be back 
8332,i ll ask  said the parlourmaid 
8333,margaret had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed 
8334,putting the door on the chain  for leonard s appearance demanded this  she went through to the smoking room  which was occupied by tibby 
8335,tibby was asleep 
8336,he had had a good lunch 
8337,charles wilcox had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview 
8338,he said drowsily  i don t know 
8339,hilton 
8340,howards end 
8341,who is it 
8342,i ll ask  sir 
8343,no  don t bother 
8344,they have taken the car to howards end  said the parlourmaid to leonard 
8345,he thanked her  and asked whereabouts that place was 
8346,you appear to want to know a good deal  she remarked 
8347,but margaret had forbidden her to be mysterious 
8348,she told him against her better judgment that howards end was in hertfordshire 
8349,is it a village  please 
8350,village 
8351,it s mr  wilcox s private house  at least  it s one of them 
8352,mrs  wilcox keeps her furniture there 
8353,hilton is the village 
8354,yes 
8355,and when will they be back 
8356,mr  schlegel doesn t know 
8357,we can t know everything  can we 
8358,she shut him out  and went to attend to the telephone  which was ringing furiously 
8359,he loitered away another night of agony 
8360,confession grew more difficult 
8361,as soon as possible he went to bed 
8362,he watched a patch of moonlight cross the floor of their lodging  and  as sometimes happens when the mind is overtaxed  he fell asleep for the rest of the room  but kept awake for the patch of moonlight 
8363,horrible 
8364,then began one of those disintegrating dialogues 
8365,part of him said  why horrible 
8366,it s ordinary light from the moon 
8367,but it moves 
8368,so does the moon 
8369,but it is a clenched fist 
8370,why not 
8371,but it is going to touch me 
8372,let it 
8373,and  seeming to gather motion  the patch ran up his blanket 
8374,presently a blue snake appeared  then another parallel to it 
8375,is there life in the moon 
8376,of course 
8377,but i thought it was uninhabited 
8378,not by time  death  judgment  and the smaller snakes 
8379,smaller snakes  said leonard indignantly and aloud 
8380,what a notion 
8381,by a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the room up 
8382,jacky  the bed  their food  their clothes on the chair  gradually entered his consciousness  and the horror vanished outwards  like a ring that is spreading through water 
8383,i say  jacky  i m going out for a bit 
8384,she was breathing regularly 
8385,the patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket  and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet 
8386,why had he been afraid 
8387,he went to the window  and saw that the moon was descending through a clear sky 
8388,he saw her volcanoes  and the bright expanses that a gracious error has named seas 
8389,they paled  for the sun  who had lit them up  was coming to light the earth 
8390,sea of serenity  sea of tranquillity  ocean of the lunar storms  merged into one lucent drop  itself to slip into the sempiternal dawn 
8391,and he had been afraid of the moon 
8392,he dressed among the contending lights  and went through his money 
8393,it was running low again  but enough for a return ticket to hilton 
8394,as it clinked  jacky opened her eyes 
8395,hullo  len 
8396,what ho  len 
8397,what ho  jacky  see you again later 
8398,she turned over and slept 
8399,the house was unlocked  their landlord being a salesman at covent garden 
8400,leonard passed out and made his way down to the station 
8401,the train  though it did not start for an hour  was already drawn up at the end of the platform  and he lay down in it and slept 
8402,with the first jolt he was in daylight  they had left the gateways of king s cross  and were under blue sky 
8403,tunnels followed  and after each the sky grew bluer  and from the embankment at finsbury park he had his first sight of the sun 
8404,it rolled along behind the eastern smokes  a wheel  whose fellow was the descending moon  and as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky  not its lord 
8405,he dozed again 
8406,over tewin water it was day 
8407,to the left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches  to the right leonard saw up into the tewin woods and towards the church  with its wild legend of immortality 
8408,six forest trees  that is a fact  grow out of one of the graves in tewin churchyard 
8409,the grave s occupant  that is the legend  is an atheist  who declared that if god existed  six forest trees would grow out of her grave 
8410,these things in hertfordshire  and farther afield lay the house of a hermit  mrs  wilcox had known him  who barred himself up  and wrote prophecies  and gave all he had to the poor 
8411,while  powdered in between  were the villas of business men  who saw life more steadily  though with the steadiness of the half closed eye 
8412,over all the sun was streaming  to all the birds were singing  to all the primroses were yellow  and the speedwell blue  and the country  however they interpreted her  was uttering her cry of now 
8413,she did not free leonard yet  and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at hilton 
8414,but remorse had become beautiful 
8415,hilton was asleep  or at the earliest  breakfasting 
8416,leonard noticed the contrast when he stepped out of it into the country 
8417,here men had been up since dawn 
8418,their hours were ruled  not by a london office  but by the movements of the crops and the sun 
8419,that they were men of the finest type only the sentimentalists can declare 
8420,but they kept to the life of daylight 
8421,they are england s hope 
8422,clumsily they carry forward the torch of the sun  until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up 
8423,half clodhopper  half board school prig  they can still throw back to a nobler stock  and breed yeomen 
8424,at the chalk pit a motor passed him 
8425,in it was another type  whom nature favours  the imperial 
8426,healthy  ever in motion  it hopes to inherit the earth 
8427,it breeds as quickly as the yeoman  and as soundly  strong is the temptation to acclaim it as a super yeoman  who carries his country s virtue overseas 
8428,but the imperialist is not what he thinks or seems 
8429,he is a destroyer 
8430,he prepares the way for cosmopolitanism  and though his ambitions may be fulfilled  the earth that he inherits will be grey 
8431,to leonard  intent on his private sin  there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere 
8432,it was not the optimism which he had been taught at school 
8433,again and again must the drums tap  and the goblins stalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial 
8434,it was rather paradoxical  and arose from his sorrow 
8435,death destroys a man  but the idea of death saves him  that is the best account of it that has yet been given 
8436,squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us  and strengthen the wings of love 
8437,they can beckon  it is not certain that they will  for they are not love s servants 
8438,but they can beckon  and the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him 
8439,as he approached the house all thought stopped 
8440,contradictory notions stood side by side in his mind 
8441,he was terrified but happy  ashamed  but had done no sin 
8442,he knew the confession  mrs  wilcox  i have done wrong  but sunrise had robbed its meaning  and he felt rather on a supreme adventure 
8443,he entered a garden  steadied himself against a motor car that he found in it  found a door open and entered a house 
8444,yes  it would be very easy 
8445,from a room to the left he heard voices  margaret s amongst them 
8446,his own name was called aloud  and a man whom he had never seen said  oh  is he there 
8447,i am not surprised 
8448,i now thrash him within an inch of his life 
8449,mrs  wilcox  said leonard  i have done wrong 
8450,the man took him by the collar and cried  bring me a stick 
8451,women were screaming 
8452,a stick  very bright  descended 
8453,it hurt him  not where it descended  but in the heart 
8454,books fell over him in a shower 
8455,nothing had sense 
8456,get some water  commanded charles  who had all through kept very calm 
8457,he s shamming 
8458,of course i only used the blade 
8459,here  carry him out into the air 
8460,thinking that he understood these things  margaret obeyed him 
8461,they laid leonard  who was dead  on the gravel  helen poured water over him 
8462,that s enough  said charles 
8463,yes  murder s enough  said miss avery  coming out of the house with the sword 
8464,when charles left ducie street he had caught the first train home  but had no inkling of the newest development until late at night 
8465,then his father  who had dined alone  sent for him  and in very grave tones inquired for margaret 
8466,i don t know where she is  pater said charles 
8467,dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her 
8468,tell me when she comes in 
8469,another hour passed 
8470,the servants went to bed  and charles visited his father again  to receive further instructions 
8471,mrs  wilcox had still not returned 
8472,i ll sit up for her as late as you like  but she can hardly be coming 
8473,isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel 
8474,perhaps  said mr  wilcox thoughtfully   perhaps 
8475,can i do anything for you  sir 
8476,not to night  my boy 
8477,mr  wilcox liked being called sir 
8478,he raised his eyes  and gave his son more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured 
8479,he saw charles as little boy and strong man in one 
8480,though his wife had proved unstable his children were left to him 
8481,after midnight he tapped on charles s door 
8482,i can t sleep  he said 
8483,i had better have a talk with you and get it over 
8484,he complained of the heat 
8485,charles took him out into the garden  and they paced up and down in their dressing gowns 
8486,charles became very quiet as the story unrolled  he had known all along that margaret was as bad as her sister 
8487,she will feel differently in the morning  said mr  wilcox  who had of course said nothing about mrs  bast 
8488,but i cannot let this kind of thing continue without comment 
8489,i am morally certain that she is with her sister at howards end 
8490,the house is mine  and  charles  it will be yours  and when i say that no one is to live there  i mean that no one is to live there 
8491,i won t have it 
8492,he looked angrily at the moon 
8493,to my mind this question is connected with something far greater  the rights of property itself 
8494,undoubtedly  said charles 
8495,mr  wilcox linked his arm in his son s  but somehow liked him less as he told him more 
8496,i don t want you to conclude that my wife and i had anything of the nature of a quarrel 
8497,she was only overwrought  as who would not be 
8498,i shall do what i can for helen  but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once 
8499,do you see 
8500,that is a sine qua non 
8501,then at eight to morrow i may go up in the car 
8502,eight or earlier 
8503,say that you are acting as my representative  and  of course  use no violence  charles 
8504,on the morrow  as charles returned  leaving leonard dead upon the gravel  it did not seem to him that he had used violence 
8505,death was due to heart disease 
8506,his stepmother herself had said so  and even miss avery had acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword 
8507,on his way through the village he informed the police  who thanked him  and said there must be an inquest 
8508,he found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the sun 
8509,it has been pretty horrible  said charles gravely 
8510,they were there  and they had the man up there with them too 
8511,what  what man 
8512,i told you last night 
8513,his name was bast 
8514,my god  is it possible 
8515,said mr  wilcox 
8516,in your mother s house 
8517,charles  in your mother s house 
8518,i know  pater 
8519,that was what i felt 
8520,as a matter of fact  there is no need to trouble about the man 
8521,he was in the last stages of heart disease  and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off 
8522,the police are seeing about it at this moment 
8523,mr  wilcox listened attentively 
8524,i got up there  oh  it couldn t have been more than half past seven 
8525,the avery woman was lighting a fire for them 
8526,they were still upstairs 
8527,i waited in the drawing room 
8528,we were all moderately civil and collected  though i had my suspicions 
8529,i gave them your message  and mrs  wilcox said  oh yes  i see  yes  in that way of hers 
8530,nothing else 
8531,i promised to tell you  with her love  that she was going to germany with her sister this evening 
8532,that was all we had time for 
8533,mr  wilcox seemed relieved 
8534,because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding  for suddenly mrs  wilcox screamed out his name 
8535,i recognised it  and i went for him in the hall 
8536,was i right  pater 
8537,i thought things were going a little too far 
8538,right  my dear boy 
8539,i don t know 
8540,but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t 
8541,then did he just  just  crumple up as you said 
8542,he shrunk from the simple word 
8543,he caught hold of the bookcase  which came down over him 
8544,so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden 
8545,we all thought he was shamming 
8546,however  he s dead right enough 
8547,awful business 
8548,sword 
8549,cried his father  with anxiety in his voice 
8550,what sword 
8551,whose sword 
8552,a sword of theirs 
8553,what were you doing with it 
8554,well  didn t you see  pater  i had to snatch up the first thing handy 
8555,i hadn t a riding whip or stick 
8556,i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword 
8557,then what 
8558,he pulled over the bookcase  as i said  and fell  said charles  with a sigh 
8559,it was no fun doing errands for his father  who was never quite satisfied 
8560,but the real because was heart disease 
8561,of that you re sure 
8562,that or a fit 
8563,however  we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics 
8564,they went in to breakfast 
8565,charles had a racking headache  consequent on motoring before food 
8566,he was also anxious about the future  reflecting that the police must detain helen and margaret for the inquest and ferret the whole thing out 
8567,he saw himself obliged to leave hilton 
8568,one could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal  it was not fair on one s wife 
8569,his comfort was that the pater s eyes were opened at last 
8570,there would be a horrible smash up  and probably a separation from margaret  then they would all start again  more as they had been in his mother s time 
8571,i think i ll go round to the police station  said his father when breakfast was over 
8572,what for 
8573,cried dolly  who had still not been told 
8574,very well  sir 
8575,which car will you have 
8576,i think i ll walk 
8577,it s a good half mile  said charles  stepping into the garden 
8578,the sun s very hot for april 
8579,shan t i take you up  and then  perhaps  a little spin round by tewin 
8580,you go on as if i didn t know my own mind  said mr  wilcox fretfully 
8581,charles hardened his mouth 
8582,you young fellows one idea is to get into a motor 
8583,i tell you  i want to walk  i m very fond of walking 
8584,oh  all right  i m about the house if you want me for anything 
8585,i thought of not going up to the office to day  if that is your wish 
8586,it is  indeed  my boy  said mr  wilcox  and laid a hand on his sleeve 
8587,charles did not like it  he was uneasy about his father  who did not seem himself this morning 
8588,there was a petulant touch about him  more like a woman 
8589,could it be that he was growing old 
8590,the wilcoxes were not lacking in affection  they had it royally  but they did not know how to use it 
8591,it was the talent in the napkin  and  for a warm hearted man  charles had conveyed very little joy 
8592,as he watched his father shuffling up the road  he had a vague regret  a wish that something had been different somewhere  a wish  though he did not express it thus  that he had been taught to say i in his youth 
8593,he meant to make up for margaret s defection  but knew that his father had been very happy with her until yesterday 
8594,how had she done it 
8595,by some dishonest trick  no doubt  but how 
8596,mr  wilcox reappeared at eleven  looking very tired 
8597,there was to be an inquest on leonard s body to morrow  and the police required his son to attend 
8598,i expected that  said charles 
8599,i shall naturally be the most important witness there 
8600,out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with aunt juley s illness and was not even to end with leonard s death  it seemed impossible to margaret that healthy life should re emerge 
8601,events succeeded in a logical  yet senseless  train 
8602,people lost their humanity  and took values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing cards 
8603,it was natural that henry should do this and because helen to do that  and then think her wrong for doing it  natural that she herself should think him wrong  natural that leonard should want to know how helen was  and come  and charles be angry with him for coming  natural  but unreal 
8604,in this jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true selves 
8605,here leonard lay dead in the garden  from natural causes  yet life was a deep  deep river  death a blue sky  life was a house  death a wisp of hay  a flower  a tower  life and death were anything and everything  except this ordered insanity  where the king takes the queen  and the ace the king 
8606,ah  no  there was beauty and adventure behind  such as the man at her feet had yearned for  there was hope this side of the grave  there were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now 
8607,as a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning  so she  from the turmoil and horror of those days  caught glimpses of the diviner wheels 
8608,and helen  dumb with fright  but trying to keep calm for the child s sake  and miss avery  calm  but murmuring tenderly  no one ever told the lad he ll have a child   they also reminded her that horror is not the end 
8609,to what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know  but there seemed great chance that a child would be born into the world  to take the great chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers 
8610,she moved through the sunlit garden  gathering narcissi  crimson eyed and white 
8611,there was nothing else to be done  the time for telegrams and anger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of leonard should be folded on his breast and be filled with flowers 
8612,here was the father  leave it at that 
8613,let squalor be turned into tragedy  whose eyes are the stars  and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn 
8614,and even the influx of officials  even the return of the doctor  vulgar and acute  could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty 
8615,science explained people  but could not understand them 
8616,after long centuries among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves  but this would never give understanding 
8617,one could open the heart to mr  mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to them  for they wanted everything down in black and white  and black and white was exactly what they were left with 
8618,they questioned her closely about charles 
8619,she never suspected why 
8620,death had come  and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease 
8621,they asked to see her father s sword 
8622,she explained that charles s anger was natural  but mistaken 
8623,miserable questions about leonard followed  all of which she answered unfalteringly 
8624,then back to charles again 
8625,no doubt mr  wilcox may have induced death  she said  but if it wasn t one thing it would have been another as you know 
8626,at last they thanked her and took the sword and the body down to hilton 
8627,she began to pick up the books from the floor 
8628,helen had gone to the farm 
8629,it was the best place for her  since she had to wait for the inquest 
8630,though  as if things were not hard enough  madge and her husband had raised trouble  they did not see why they should receive the offscourings of howards end 
8631,and  of course  they were right 
8632,the whole world was going to be right  and amply avenge any brave talk against the conventions 
8633,nothing matters  the schlegels had said in the past  except one s self respect and that of one s friends 
8634,when the time came  other things mattered terribly 
8635,however  madge had yielded  and helen was assured of peace for one day and night  and to morrow she would return to germany 
8636,as for herself  she determined to go too 
8637,no message came from henry  perhaps he expected her to apologise 
8638,now that she had time to think over her own tragedy  she was unrepentant 
8639,she neither forgave him for his behaviour nor wished to forgive him 
8640,her speech to him seemed perfect 
8641,she would not have altered a word 
8642,it had to be uttered once in a life  to adjust the lopsidedness of the world 
8643,it was spoken not only to her husband  but to thousands of men like him  a protest against the inner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age 
8644,though he would build up his life without hers  she could not apologise 
8645,he had refused to connect  on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man  and their love must take the consequences 
8646,no  there was nothing more to be done 
8647,they had tried not to go over the precipice  but perhaps the fall was inevitable 
8648,and it comforted her to think that the future was certainly inevitable  because and effect would go jangling forward to some goal doubtless  but to none that she could imagine 
8649,at such moments the soul retires within  to float upon the bosom of a deeper stream  and has communion with the dead  and sees the world s glory not diminished  but different in kind to what she has supposed 
8650,she alters her focus until trivial things are blurred 
8651,margaret had been tending this way all the winter 
8652,leonard s death brought her to the goal 
8653,alas  that henry should fade away as reality emerged  and only her love for him should remain clear  stamped with his image like the cameos we rescue out of dreams 
8654,with unfaltering eye she traced his future 
8655,he would soon present a healthy mind to the world again  and what did he or the world care if he was rotten at the core 
8656,he would grow into a rich  jolly old man  at times a little sentimental about women  but emptying his glass with anyone 
8657,tenacious of power  he would keep charles and the rest dependent  and retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age 
8658,he would settle down  though she could not realise this 
8659,in her eyes henry was always moving and causing others to move  until the ends of the earth met 
8660,but in time he must get too tired to move  and settle down 
8661,what next 
8662,the inevitable word 
8663,the release of the soul to its appropriate heaven 
8664,would they meet in it 
8665,margaret believed in immortality for herself 
8666,an eternal future had always seemed natural to her 
8667,and henry believed in it for himself 
8668,yet  would they meet again 
8669,are there not rather endless levels beyond the grave  as the theory that he had censured teaches 
8670,and his level  whether higher or lower  could it possibly be the same as hers 
8671,thus gravely meditating  she was summoned by him 
8672,he sent up crane in the motor 
8673,other servants passed like water  but the chauffeur remained  though impertinent and disloyal 
8674,margaret disliked crane  and he knew it 
8675,is it the keys that mr  wilcox wants 
8676,she asked 
8677,he didn t say  madam 
8678,you haven t any note for me 
8679,he didn t say  madam 
8680,after a moment s thought she locked up howards end 
8681,it was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever 
8682,she raked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen  and spread the coals in the gravelled yard 
8683,she closed the windows and drew the curtains 
8684,henry would probably sell the place now 
8685,she was determined not to spare him  for nothing new had happened as far as they were concerned 
8686,her mood might never have altered from yesterday evening 
8687,he was standing a little outside charles s gate  and motioned the car to stop 
8688,when his wife got out he said hoarsely  i prefer to discuss things with you outside 
8689,it will be more appropriate in the road  i am afraid  said margaret 
8690,did you get my message 
8691,what about 
8692,i am going to germany with my sister 
8693,i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home 
8694,our talk last night was more important than you have realised 
8695,i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you 
8696,i am extremely tired  said henry  in injured tones 
8697,i have been walking about all the morning  and wish to sit down 
8698,certainly  if you will consent to sit on the grass 
8699,the great north road should have been bordered all its length with glebe 
8700,henry s kind had filched most of it 
8701,she moved to the scrap opposite  wherein were the six hills 
8702,they sat down on the farther side  so that they could not be seen by charles or dolly 
8703,here are your keys  said margaret 
8704,she tossed them towards him 
8705,they fell on the sunlit slope of grass  and he did not pick them up 
8706,i have something to tell you  he said gently 
8707,she knew this superficial gentleness  this confession of hastiness  that was only intended to enhance her admiration of the male 
8708,i don t want to hear it  she replied 
8709,my sister is going to be ill 
8710,my life is going to be with her now 
8711,we must manage to build up something  she and i and her child 
8712,where are you going 
8713,munich 
8714,we start after the inquest  if she is not too ill 
8715,after the inquest 
8716,yes 
8717,have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be 
8718,yes  heart disease 
8719,no  my dear  manslaughter 
8720,margaret drove her fingers through the grass 
8721,the hill beneath her moved as if it were alive 
8722,manslaughter  repeated mr  wilcox 
8723,charles may go to prison 
8724,i dare not tell him 
8725,i don t know what to do  what to do  i m broken  i m ended 
8726,no sudden warmth arose in her 
8727,she did not see that to break him was her only hope 
8728,she did not enfold the sufferer in her arms 
8729,but all through that day and the next a new life began to move 
8730,the verdict was brought in 
8731,charles was committed for trial 
8732,it was against all reason that he should be punished  but the law  notwithstanding  sentenced him to three years imprisonment 
8733,then henry s fortress gave way 
8734,he could bear no one but his wife  he shambled up to margaret afterwards and asked her to do what she could with him 
8735,she did what seemed easiest  she took him down to recruit at howards end 
8736,tom s father was cutting the big meadow 
8737,he passed again and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass  encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the field 
8738,tom was negotiating with helen 
8739,i haven t any idea  she replied 
8740,do you suppose baby may  meg 
8741,margaret put down her work and regarded them absently 
8742,what was that 
8743,she asked 
8744,tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay 
8745,i haven t the least notion  answered margaret  and took up her work again 
8746,now  tom  baby is not to stand  he is not to lie on his face  he is not to lie so that his head wags  he is not to be teased or tickled  and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter 
8747,will you be as careful as all that 
8748,tom held out his arms 
8749,that child is a wonderful nursemaid  remarked margaret 
8750,he is fond of baby 
8751,that s why he does it  was helen s answer 
8752,they re going to be lifelong friends 
8753,starting at the ages of six and one 
8754,of course 
8755,it will be a great thing for tom 
8756,it may be a greater thing for baby 
8757,fourteen months had passed  but margaret still stopped at howards end 
8758,no better plan had occurred to her 
8759,the meadow was being recut  the great red poppies were reopening in the garden 
8760,july would follow with the little red poppies among the wheat  august with the cutting of the wheat 
8761,these little events would become part of her year after year 
8762,every summer she would fear lest the well should give out  every winter lest the pipes should freeze  every westerly gale might blow the wych elm down and bring the end of all things  and so she could not read or talk during a westerly gale 
8763,the air was tranquil now 
8764,she and her sister were sitting on the remains of evie s rockery  where the lawn merged into the field 
8765,what a time they all are  said helen 
8766,what can they be doing inside 
8767,margaret  who was growing less talkative  made no answer 
8768,the noise of the cutter came intermittently  like the breaking of waves 
8769,close by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell holes 
8770,i wish henry was out to enjoy this  said helen 
8771,this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house 
8772,it s very hard 
8773,it has to be  said margaret 
8774,the hay fever is his chief objection against living here  but he thinks it worth while 
8775,meg  is or isn t he ill 
8776,i can t make out 
8777,not ill 
8778,eternally tired 
8779,he has worked very hard all his life  and noticed nothing 
8780,those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing 
8781,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle 
8782,dreadfully 
8783,that is why i wish dolly had not come  too  to day 
8784,still  he wanted them all to come 
8785,it has to be 
8786,why does he want them 
8787,margaret did not answer 
8788,meg  may i tell you something 
8789,i like henry 
8790,you d be odd if you didn t  said margaret 
8791,i usen t to 
8792,usen t 
8793,she lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past 
8794,they had crossed it  always excepting leonard and charles 
8795,they were building up a new life  obscure  yet gilded with tranquillity 
8796,leonard was dead  charles had two years more in prison 
8797,one usen t always to see clearly before that time 
8798,it was different now 
8799,i like henry because he does worry 
8800,and he likes you because you don t 
8801,helen sighed 
8802,she seemed humiliated  and buried her face in her hands 
8803,after a time she said  about love  a transition less abrupt than it appeared 
8804,margaret never stopped working 
8805,i mean a woman s love for a man  i supposed i should hang my life on to that once  and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me 
8806,but everything is peaceful now  i seem cured 
8807,that herr forstmeister  whom frieda keeps writing about  must be a noble character  but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone 
8808,it isn t shame or mistrust of myself 
8809,i simply couldn t 
8810,i m ended 
8811,i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl  and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing 
8812,but it hasn t been  it has been itself a dream 
8813,do you agree 
8814,i do not agree 
8815,i do not 
8816,i ought to remember leonard as my lover  said helen  stepping down into the field 
8817,i tempted him  and killed him  and it is surely the least i can do 
8818,i would like to throw out all my heart to leonard on such an afternoon as this 
8819,but i cannot 
8820,it is no good pretending 
8821,i am forgetting him 
8822,her eyes filled with tears 
8823,how nothing seems to match  how  my darling  my precious   she broke off 
8824,tommy 
8825,yes  please 
8826,baby s not to try and stand   there s something wanting in me  i see you loving henry  and understanding him better daily  and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least  but i  is it some awful  appalling  criminal defect 
8827,margaret silenced her 
8828,she said  it is only that people are far more different than is pretended 
8829,all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop 
8830,here and there they have the matter out  and it comforts them 
8831,don t fret yourself  helen 
8832,develop what you have  love your child 
8833,i do not love children 
8834,i am thankful to have none 
8835,i can play with their beauty and charm  but that is all  nothing real  not one scrap of what there ought to be  and others  others go farther still  and move outside humanity altogether 
8836,a place  as well as a person  may catch the glow 
8837,don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end 
8838,it is part of the battle against sameness 
8839,differences  eternal differences  planted by god in a single family  so that there may always be colour  sorrow perhaps  but colour in the daily grey 
8840,then i can t have you worrying about leonard 
8841,don t drag in the personal when it will not come 
8842,forget him 
8843,yes  yes  but what has leonard got out of life 
8844,perhaps an adventure 
8845,is that enough 
8846,not for us 
8847,but for him 
8848,helen took up a bunch of grass 
8849,she looked at the sorrel  and the red and white and yellow clover  and the quaker grass  and the daisies  and the bents that composed it 
8850,she raised it to her face 
8851,is it sweetening yet 
8852,asked margaret 
8853,no  only withered 
8854,it will sweeten to morrow 
8855,helen smiled 
8856,oh  meg  you are a person  she said 
8857,think of the racket and torture this time last year 
8858,but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried 
8859,what a change  and all through you 
8860,oh  we merely settled down 
8861,you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive  all through the autumn and the winter 
8862,yes  but who settled us down 
8863,margaret did not reply 
8864,the scything had begun  and she took off her pince nez to watch it 
8865,you  cried helen 
8866,you did it all  sweetest  though you re too stupid to see 
8867,living here was your plan  i wanted you  he wanted you  and everyone said it was impossible  but you knew  just think of our lives without you  meg  i and baby with monica  revolting by theory  he handed about from dolly to evie 
8868,but you picked up the pieces  and made us a home 
8869,can t it strike you  even for a moment  that your life has been heroic 
8870,can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest  when you began to act  and did all 
8871,you were both ill at the time  said margaret 
8872,i did the obvious things 
8873,i had two invalids to nurse 
8874,here was a house  ready furnished and empty 
8875,it was obvious 
8876,i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home 
8877,no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle  but things that i can t phrase have helped me 
8878,i hope it will be permanent  said helen  drifting away to other thoughts 
8879,i think so 
8880,there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own 
8881,all the same  london s creeping 
8882,she pointed over the meadow  over eight or nine meadows  but at the end of them was a red rust 
8883,you see that in surrey and even hampshire now  she continued 
8884,i can see it from the purbeck downs 
8885,and london is only part of something else  i m afraid 
8886,life s going to be melted down  all over the world 
8887,margaret knew that her sister spoke truly 
8888,howards end  oniton  the purbeck downs  the oderberge  were all survivals  and the melting pot was being prepared for them 
8889,logically  they had no right to be alive 
8890,one s hope was in the weakness of logic 
8891,were they possibly the earth beating time 
8892,because a thing is going strong now  it need not go strong for ever  she said 
8893,this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years 
8894,it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement  because it will rest on the earth 
8895,all the signs are against it now  but i can t help hoping  and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past 
8896,they turned and looked at it 
8897,their own memories coloured it now  for helen s child had been born in the central room of the nine 
8898,then margaret said  oh  take care    for something moved behind the window of the hall  and the door opened 
8899,the conclave s breaking at last 
8900,i ll go 
8901,it was paul 
8902,helen retreated with the children far into the field 
8903,friendly voices greeted her 
8904,margaret rose  to encounter a man with a heavy black moustache 
8905,my father has asked for you  he said with hostility 
8906,she took her work and followed him 
8907,we have been talking business  he continued  but i dare say you knew all about it beforehand 
8908,yes  i did 
8909,clumsy of movement  for he had spent all his life in the saddle  paul drove his foot against the paint of the front door 
8910,mrs  wilcox gave a little cry of annoyance 
8911,she did not like anything scratched  she stopped in the hall to take dolly s boa and gloves out of a vase 
8912,her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining room  and by his side  holding his hand rather ostentatiously  was evie 
8913,dolly  dressed in purple  sat near the window 
8914,the room was a little dark and airless  they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay 
8915,margaret joined the family without speaking  the five of them had met already at tea  and she knew quite well what was going to be said 
8916,averse to wasting her time  she went on sewing 
8917,the clock struck six 
8918,is this going to suit everyone 
8919,said henry in a weary voice 
8920,he used the old phrases  but their effect was unexpected and shadowy 
8921,because i don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that i have been unfair 
8922,it s apparently got to suit us  said paul 
8923,i beg your pardon  my boy 
8924,you have only to speak  and i will leave the house to you instead 
8925,paul frowned ill temperedly  and began scratching at his arm 
8926,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me  and i have come home to look after the business  it s no good my settling down here  he said at last 
8927,it s not really the country  and it s not the town 
8928,very well 
8929,does my arrangement suit you  evie 
8930,of course  father 
8931,and you  dolly 
8932,dolly raised her faded little face  which sorrow could wither but not steady 
8933,perfectly splendidly  she said 
8934,i thought charles wanted it for the boys  but last time i saw him he said no  because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again 
8935,charles says we ought to change our name  but i cannot think what to  for wilcox just suits charles and me  and i can t think of any other name 
8936,there was a general silence 
8937,dolly looked nervously round  fearing that she had been inappropriate 
8938,paul continued to scratch his arm 
8939,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely  said henry 
8940,and let everyone understand that  and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise 
8941,margaret did not answer 
8942,there was something uncanny in her triumph 
8943,she  who had never expected to conquer anyone  had charged straight through these wilcoxes and broken up their lives 
8944,in consequence  i leave my wife no money  said henry 
8945,that is her own wish 
8946,all that she would have had will be divided among you 
8947,i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime  so that you may be independent of me 
8948,that is her wish  too 
8949,she also is giving away a great deal of money 
8950,she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years  she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew  down in the field 
8951,is all that clear 
8952,does everyone understand 
8953,paul rose to his feet 
8954,he was accustomed to natives  and a very little shook him out of the englishman 
8955,feeling manly and cynical  he said  down in the field 
8956,oh  come 
8957,i think we might have had the whole establishment  piccaninnies included 
8958,mrs  cahill whispered  don t  paul 
8959,you promised you d take care 
8960,feeling a woman of the world  she rose and prepared to take her leave 
8961,her father kissed her 
8962,good bye  old girl  he said  don t you worry about me 
8963,good bye  dad 
8964,then it was dolly s turn 
8965,anxious to contribute  she laughed nervously  and said  good bye  mr  wilcox 
8966,it does seem curious that mrs  wilcox should have left margaret howards end  and yet she get it  after all 
8967,from evie came a sharply drawn breath 
8968,goodbye  she said to margaret  and kissed her 
8969,and again and again fell the word  like the ebb of a dying sea 
8970,good bye 
8971,good bye  dolly 
8972,so long  father 
8973,good bye  my boy  always take care of yourself 
8974,good bye  mrs  wilcox 
8975,good bye 
8976,margaret saw their visitors to the gate 
8977,then she returned to her husband and laid her head in his hands 
8978,he was pitiably tired 
8979,but dolly s remark had interested her 
8980,at last she said  could you tell me  henry  what was that about mrs  wilcox having left me howards end 
8981,tranquilly he replied  yes  she did 
8982,but that is a very old story 
8983,when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return  and  not being herself at the time  scribbled howards end on a piece of paper 
8984,i went into it thoroughly  and  as it was clearly fanciful  i set it aside  little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future 
8985,margaret was silent 
8986,something shook her life in its inmost recesses  and she shivered 
8987,i didn t do wrong  did i 
8988,he asked  bending down 
8989,you didn t  darling 
8990,nothing has been done wrong 
8991,from the garden came laughter 
8992,here they are at last  exclaimed henry  disengaging himself with a smile 
8993,helen rushed into the gloom  holding tom by one hand and carrying her baby on the other 
8994,there were shouts of infectious joy 
8995,the field s cut 
8996,helen cried excitedly   the big meadow 
8997,we ve seen to the very end  and it ll be such a crop of hay as never 
8998,weybridge
