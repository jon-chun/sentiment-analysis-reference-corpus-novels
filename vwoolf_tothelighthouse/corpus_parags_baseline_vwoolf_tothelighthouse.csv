20,20,0,"""Let's go,"" he said, repeating her words, clicking them out, however, with a self-consciousness that made her wince. ""Let us all go to the circus."" No. He could not say it right. He could not feel it right. But why not? she wondered. What was wrong with him then? She liked him warmly, at the moment. Had they not been taken, she asked, to circuses when they were children? Never, he answered, as if she asked the very thing he wanted; had been longing all these days to say, how they did not go to circuses. It was a large family, nine brothers and sisters, and his father was a working man. ""My father is a chemist, Mrs. Ramsay. He keeps a shop."" He himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen. Often he went without a greatcoat in winter. He could never ""return hospitality"" (those were his parched stiff words) at college. He had to make things last twice the time other people did; he smoked the cheapest tobacco; shag; the same the old men did in the quays. He worked hard -  seven hours a day; his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody -  they were walking on and Mrs. Ramsay did not quite catch the meaning, only the words, here and there...dissertation...fellowship...readership...lectureship. She could not follow the ugly academic jargon, that rattled itself off so glibly, but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch, poor little man, and why he came out, instantly, with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters, and she would see to it that they didn't laugh at him any more; she would tell Prue about it. What he would have liked, she supposed, would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to Ibsen with the Ramsays. He was an awful prig -  oh yes, an insufferable bore. For, though they had reached the town now and were in the main street, with carts grinding past on the cobbles, still he went on talking, about settlements, and teaching, and working men, and helping our own class, and lectures, till she gathered that he had got back entire self-confidence, had recovered from the circus, and was about (and now again she liked him warmly) to tell her -  but here, the houses falling away on both sides, they came out on the quay, and the whole bay spread before them and Mrs. Ramsay could not help exclaiming, ""Oh, how beautiful!"" For the great plateful of blue water was before her; the hoary Lighthouse, distant, austere, in the midst; and on the right, as far as the eye could see, fading and falling, in soft low pleats, the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them, which always seemed to be running away into some moon country, uninhabited of men.", let us go   he said  repeating her words  clicking them out  however  with a self consciousness that made her wince   let us all go to the circus   no  he could not say it right  he could not feel it right  but why not  she wondered  what was wrong with him then  she liked him warmly  at the moment  had they not been taken  she asked  to circuses when they were children  never  he answered  as if she asked the very thing he wanted  had been longing all these days to say  how they did not go to circuses  it was a large family  nine brothers and sisters  and his father was a working man   my father is a chemist  mrs  ramsay  he keeps a shop   he himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen  often he went without a greatcoat in winter  he could never  return hospitality   those were his parched stiff words  at college  he had to make things last twice the time other people did  he smoked the cheapest tobacco  shag  the same the old men did in the quays  he worked hard    seven hours a day  his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody    they were walking on and mrs  ramsay did not quite catch the meaning  only the words  here and there   dissertation   fellowship   readership   lectureship  she could not follow the ugly academic jargon  that rattled itself off so glibly  but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch  poor little man  and why he came out  instantly  with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters  and she would see to it that they did not laugh at him any more  she would tell prue about it  what he would have liked  she supposed  would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with the ramsays  he was an awful prig    oh yes  an insufferable bore  for  though they had reached the town now and were in the main street  with carts grinding past on the cobbles  still he went on talking  about settlements  and teaching  and working men  and helping our own class  and lectures  till she gathered that he had got back entire self confidence  had recovered from the circus  and was about  and now again she liked him warmly  to tell her    but here  the houses falling away on both sides  they came out on the quay  and the whole bay spread before them and mrs  ramsay could not help exclaiming   oh  how beautiful   for the great plateful of blue water was before her  the hoary lighthouse  distant  austere  in the midst  and on the right  as far as the eye could see  fading and falling  in soft low pleats  the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them  which always seemed to be running away into some moon country  uninhabited of men ,2698,493,5.800000000000002,1.607737074019192,1.913793103448276,1.607737074019192,0.28238866396761136,4.8,1.3053427036870762,1.4354838709677422,1.3053427036870762,0.1973568475985469,0.0,0.060726682924954624,0.0,0.060726682924954624,0.0,-3.3258928571428568,-1.7291432240098206,-1.6445338698859822,-1.7291432240098206,-0.4564381208959558,7.645999999999999,1.0497022474707498,1.3076426264800858,1.0497022474707498,-0.0680507869247939,-30.847840508950828,-1.5562592881609392,-1.4017404140923668,-1.5562592881609392,-0.44020782854481294,0.7925701272893929,0.2391903418912648,0.3561998962878149,0.2391903418912648,-0.05607471113349366,"{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.9606}",0.9606,1.1342069221260718,0.5613749434644957,1.1342069221260718,-0.034780228177318545,0.09541805094130673,0.01820309072608304,0.07180086637450966,0.01820309072608304,-0.13944497521881108,0.7321557091510124,1.4390128043500938,1.5131537810365439,1.4390128043500938,0.039824624721485465,77.35484442344476,2.4507239205123383,2.1242983632883203,2.4507239205123383,-0.6945044314468248,-0.987,-0.7278606220028778,-0.019906061283829102,-0.7278606220028778,0.17646579612204707

And it was then too, in that chill and windy way, as she began to paint, that there forced themselves upon her other things, her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for her father off the Brompton Road, and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself (thank Heaven she had always resisted so far) at Mrs. Ramsay's knee and say to her -  but what could one say to her?

After that, Ramsay had married. After that, what with one thing and another, the pulp had gone out of their friendship. Whose fault it was he could not say, only, after a time, repetition had taken the place of newness. It was to repeat that they met.

49,49,3,"The Ramsays were not rich, and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all. Eight children! To feed eight children on philosophy! Here was another of them, Jasper this time, strolling past, to have a shot at a bird, he said, nonchalantly, swinging Lily's hand like a pump-handle as he passed, which caused Mr. Bankes to say, bitterly, how SHE was a favourite. There was education now to be considered (true, Mrs. Ramsay had something of her own perhaps) let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those ""great fellows,"" all well grown, angular, ruthless youngsters, must require. As for being sure which was which, or in what order they came, that was beyond him. He called them privately after the Kings and Queens of England; Cam the Wicked, James the Ruthless, Andrew the Just, Prue the Fair -  for Prue would have beauty, he thought, how could she help it? -  and Andrew brains. While he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed Ramsay's case, commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities.

You have greatness, she continued, but Mr. Ramsay has none of it.

60,60,4,"She looked up -  what demon possessed him, her youngest, her cherished? -  and saw the room, saw the chairs, thought them fearfully shabby. Their entrails, as Andrew said the other day, were all over the floor; but then what was the point, she asked, of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house, with only one old woman to see to it, positively dripped with wet? Never mind, the rent was precisely twopence half-penny; the children loved it; it did her husband good to be three thousand, or if she must be accurate, three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples; and there was room for visitors. Mats, camp beds, crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose London life of service was done -  they did well enough here; and a photograph or two, and books. Books, she thought, grew of themselves. She never had time to read them. Alas! even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself: ""For her whose wishes must be obeyed""...""The happier Helen of our days""...disgraceful to say, she had never read them. And Croom on the Mind and Bates on the Savage Customs of Polynesia (""My dear, stand still,"" she said) -  neither of those could one send to the Lighthouse. At a certain moment, she supposed, the house would become so shabby that something must be done. If they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them -  that would be something. Crabs, she had to allow, if Andrew really wished to dissect them, or if Jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed, one could not prevent it; or Rose's objects -  shells, reeds, stones; for they were gifted, her children, but all in quite different ways. And the result of it was, she sighed, taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling, as she held the stocking against James's leg, that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer. The mat was fading; the wall-paper was flapping. You couldn't tell any more that those were roses on it. Still, if every door in a house is left perpetually open, and no lockmaker in the whole of Scotland can mend a bolt, things must spoil. What was the use of flinging a green Cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame? In two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup. But it was the doors that annoyed her; every door was left open. She listened. The drawing-room door was open; the hall door was open; it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open; and certainly the window on the landing was open, for that she had opened herself. That windows should be open, and doors shut -  simple as it was, could none of them remember it? She would go into the maids' bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens, except for Marie's, the Swiss girl, who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air, but then at home, she had said, ""the mountains are so beautiful."" She had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes. ""The mountains are so beautiful."" Her father was dying there, Mrs. Ramsay knew. He was leaving them fatherless. Scolding and demonstrating (how to make a bed, how to open a window, with hands that shut and spread like a Frenchwoman's) all had folded itself quietly about her, when the girl spoke, as, after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple.

67,67,4,"""But she's no more aware of her beauty than a child,"" said Mr. Bankes, replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house. And he thought of Mrs. Ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls. For always, he thought, there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face. She clapped a deer-stalker's hat on her head; she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief.

For if thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q. Here, stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums, he saw, but now far, far away, like children picking up shells, divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived, his wife and son, together, in the window. They needed his protection; he gave it them. But after Q? What comes next? After Q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes, but glimmers red in the distance. Z is only reached once by one man in a generation.

106,106,7,"He said nothing. He took opium. The children said he had stained his beard yellow with it. Perhaps. What was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy, came to them every year as an escape; and yet every year she felt the same thing; he did not trust her. She said, ""I am going to the town. Shall I get you stamps, paper, tobacco?"" and she felt him wince. He did not trust her. It was his wife's doing. She remembered that iniquity of his wife's towards him, which had made her turn to steel and adamant there, in the horrible little room in St John's Wood, when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house. He was unkempt; he dropped things on his coat; he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do; and she turned him out of the room. She said, in her odious way, ""Now, Mrs. Ramsay and I want to have a little talk together,"" and Mrs. Ramsay could see, as if before her eyes, the innumerable miseries of his life. Had he money enough to buy tobacco? Did he have to ask her for it? half a crown? eighteenpence? Oh, she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer. And always now (why, she could not guess, except that it came probably from that woman somehow) he shrank from her. He never told her anything. But what more could she have done? There was a sunny room given up to him. The children were good to him. Never did she show a sign of not wanting him. She went out of her way indeed to be friendly. Do you want stamps, do you want tobacco? Here's a book you might like and so on. And after all -  after all (here insensibly she drew herself together, physically, the sense of her own beauty becoming, as it did so seldom, present to her) after all, she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her; for instance, George Manning; Mr. Wallace; famous as they were, they would come to her of an evening, quietly, and talk alone over her fire. She bore about with her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all, veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent. She had been admired. She had been loved. She had entered rooms where mourners sat. Tears had flown in her presence. Men, and women too, letting go to the multiplicity of things, had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity. It injured her that he should shrink. It hurt her. And yet not cleanly, not rightly. That was what she minded, coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband; the sense she had now when Mr. Carmichael shuffled past, just nodding to her question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow slippers, that she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to give, to help, was vanity. For her own self-satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of her, ""O Mrs. Ramsay! dear Mrs. Ramsay...Mrs. Ramsay, of course!"" and need her and send for her and admire her? Was it not secretly this that she wanted, and therefore when Mr. Carmichael shrank away from her, as he did at this moment, making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly, she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct, but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her, and of human relations, how flawed they are, how despicable, how self-seeking, at their best. Shabby and worn out, and not presumably (her cheeks were hollow, her hair was white) any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy, she had better devote her mind to the story of the Fisherman and his Wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness (none of her children was as sensitive as he was), her son James.",he said nothing  he took opium  the children said he had stained his beard yellow

But he did not speak; he looked; he nodded; he approved; he went on. He slipped, seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause, signified some conclusion, seeing his wife and child, seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought, and bore, written up among their leaves, as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading -  he slipped, seeing all this, smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in THE TIMES about the number of Americans who visit Shakespeare's house every year. If Shakespeare had never existed, he asked, would the world have differed much from what it is today? Does the progress of civilization depend upon great men? Is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the Pharaohs? Is the lot of the average human being, however, he asked himself, the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization? Possibly not. Possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class. The liftman in the Tube is an eternal necessity. The thought was distasteful to him. He tossed his head. To avoid it, he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts. He would argue that the world exists for the average human being; that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life; they do not express it. Nor is Shakespeare necessary to it. Not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage Shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift, he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge. All this would have to be dished up for the young men at Cardiff next month, he thought; here, on his terrace, he was merely foraging and picnicking (he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly) like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses, or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood. It was all familiar; this turning, that stile, that cut across the fields. Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons, which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there, the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes, with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot alone.

116,116,8,"Mr. Bankes expected her to answer. And she was about to say something criticizing Mrs. Ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her way, high-handed, or words to that effect, when Mr. Bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture. For such it was considering his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his impersonality, and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him. For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs. Ramsay was a rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young men (and perhaps Mrs. Ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men).

She had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness. Looking along the level of Mr. Bankes's glance at her, she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped; they could only seek shelter under the shade which Mr. Bankes extended over them both. Looking along his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people (bowed over her book); the best perhaps; but also, different too from the perfect shape which one saw there. But why different, and how different? she asked herself, scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now, yet she vowed, she would inspire them, force them to move, flow, do her bidding tomorrow. How did she differ? What was the spirit in her, the essential thing, by which, had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa, you would have known it, from its twisted finger, hers indisputably? She was like a bird for speed, an arrow for directness. She was willful; she was commanding (of course, Lily reminded herself, I am thinking of her relations with women, and I am much younger, an insignificant person, living off the Brompton Road). She opened bedroom windows. She shut doors. (So she tried to start the tune of Mrs. Ramsay in her head.) Arriving late at night, with a light tap on one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her beauty was always that -  hasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it might be -  Charles Tansley losing his umbrella; Mr. Carmichael snuffling and sniffing; Mr. Bankes saying, ""The vegetable salts are lost."" All this she would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the window, in pretence that she must go, -  it was dawn, she could see the sun rising, -  half turn back, more intimately, but still always laughing, insist that she must, Minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her (but Mrs. Ramsay cared not a fig for her painting), or triumphs won by her (probably Mrs. Ramsay had had her share of those), and here she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life.

He had put on his spectacles. He had stepped back. He had raised his hand. He had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes, when Lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it. She would have snatched her picture off the easel, but she said to herself, One must. She braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture. One must, she said, one must.

127,127,8,"But the picture was not of them, she said. Or, not in his sense. There were other senses too in which one might reverence them. By a shadow here and a light there, for instance. Her tribute took that form if, as she vaguely supposed, a picture must be a tribute. A mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence. A light here required a shadow there. He considered. He was interested. He took it scientifically in complete good faith. The truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side, he explained. The largest picture in his drawing-room, which painters had praised, and valued at a higher price than he had given for it, was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the Kennet. He had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he said. Lily must come and see that picture, he said. But now -  he turned, with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas. The question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and shadows, which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he would like to have it explained -  what then did she wish to make of it? And he indicated the scene before them. She looked. She could not show him what she wished to make of it, could not see it even herself, without a brush in her hand. She took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent-minded manner, subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children -  her picture. It was a question, she remembered, how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left. She might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so; or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object (James perhaps) so. But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken.

139,139,9,"'Well, what does she want then?' said the Flounder."" And where were they now? Mrs. Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she be told? If nothing happened, she would have to speak seriously to Minta. For she could not go trapesing about all over the country, even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them). She was responsible to Minta's parents -  the Owl and the Poker. Her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read. The Owl and the Poker -  yes, they would be annoyed if they heard -  and they were certain to hear -  that Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. ""He wore a wig in the House of Commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs,"" she repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband. Dear, dear, Mrs. Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking? How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits -  interesting perhaps, but limited after all -  of that bird? Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her husband that night, coming back from the party). However, Minta came...Yes, she came, Mrs. Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a woman had once accused her of ""robbing her of her daughter's affections""; something Mrs. Doyle had said made her remember that charge again. Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wished -  that was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. How could she help being ""like that"" to look at? No one could accuse her of taking pains to impress. She was often ashamed of her own shabbiness. Nor was she domineering, nor was she tyrannical. It was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy. About things like that she did feel passionately, and would, if she had the chance, have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see. No hospital on the whole island. It was a disgrace. Milk delivered at your door in London positively brown with dirt. It should be made illegal.

140,140,9,"Oh, but she never wanted James to grow a day older! or Cam either. These two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were, demons of wickedness, angels of delight, never to see them grow up into long-legged monsters. Nothing made up up for the loss. When she read just now to James, ""and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets,"" and his eyes darkened, she thought, why should they grow up and lose all that? He was the most gifted, the most sensitive of her children. But all, she thought, were full of promise. Prue, a perfect angel with the others, and sometimes now, at night especially, she took one's breath away with her beauty. Andrew -  even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary. And Nancy and Roger, they were both wild creatures now, scampering about over the country all day long. As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had a wonderful gift with her hands. If they had charades, Rose made the dresses; made everything; liked best arranging tables, flowers, anything. She did not like it that Jasper should shoot birds; but it was only a stage; they all went through stages. Why, she asked, pressing her chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast? Why should they go to school? She would have liked always to have had a baby. She was happiest carrying one in her arms. Then people might say she was tyrannical, domineering, masterful, if they chose; she did not mind. And, touching his hair with her lips, she thought, he will never be so happy again, but stopped herself, remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that. Still, it was true. They were happier now than they would ever be again. A tenpenny tea set made Cam happy for days. She heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke. They came bustling along the passage. Then the door sprang open and in they came, fresh as roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the dining-room after breakfast, which they did every day of their lives, was a positive event to them, and so on, with one thing after another, all day long, until she went up to say good-night to them, and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries, still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish -  something they had heard, something they had picked up in the garden. They all had their little treasures...And so she went down and said to her husband, Why must they grow up and lose it all? Never will they be so happy again. And he was angry. Why take such a gloomy view of life? he said. It is not sensible. For it was odd; and she believed it to be true; that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier, more hopeful on the whole, than she was. Less exposed to human worries -  perhaps that was it. He had always his work to fall back on. Not that she herself was ""pessimistic,"" as he accused her of being. Only she thought life -  and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes -  her fifty years. There it was before her -  life. Life, she thought -  but she did not finish her thought. She took a look at life, for she had a clear sense of it there, something real, something private, which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband. A sort of transaction went on between them, in which she was on one side, and life was on another, and she was always trying to get the better of it, as it was of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when she sat alone); there were, she remembered, great reconciliation scenes; but for the most part, oddly enough, she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance. There were eternal problems: suffering; death; the poor. There was always a woman dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to all these children, You shall go through it all. To eight people she had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds). For that reason, knowing what was before them -  love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places -  she had often the feeling, Why must they grow up and lose it all? And then she said to herself, brandishing her sword at life, Nonsense. They will be perfectly happy. And here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because whatever she might feel about her own transaction, she had had experiences which need not happen to every one (she did not name them to herself); she was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for her too, to say that people must marry; people must have

147,147,10,"No, she thought, putting together some of the pictures he had cut out -   a refrigerator, a mowing machine, a gentleman in evening dress -   children never forget. For this reason, it was so important what one said, and what one did, and it was a relief when they went to bed. For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need of -  to think; well, not even to think. To be silent; to be alone. All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others. Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures. When life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless. And to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources, she supposed; one after another, she, Lily, Augustus Carmichael, must feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish. Beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep; but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by. Her horizon seemed to her limitless. There were all the places she had not seen; the Indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in Rome. This core of darkness could go anywhere, for no one saw it. They could not stop it, she thought, exulting. There was freedom, there was peace, there was, most welcome of all, a summoning together, a resting on a platform of stability. Not as oneself did one find rest ever, in her experience (she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles) but as a wedge of darkness. Losing personality, one lost the fret, the hurry, the stir; and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace, this rest, this eternity; and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the Lighthouse, the long steady stroke, the last of the three, which was her stroke, for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw; and this thing, the long steady stroke, was her stroke. Often she found herself sitting and looking, sitting and looking, with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at -  that light, for example. And it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that -  ""Children don't forget, children don't forget"" -  which she would repeat and begin adding to it, It will end, it will end, she said. It will come, it will come, when suddenly she added, We are in the hands of the Lord.",no  she thought  putting together some of the pictures he had cut out     a refrigerator  a mowing machine  a gentleman in evening dress     children never forget  for this reason  it was so important what one said  and what one did  and it was a relief when they went to bed  for now she need not think about anybody  she could be herself  by herself  and that was what now she often felt the need of    to think  well  not even to think  to be silent  to be alone  all the being and the doing  expansive  glittering  vocal  evaporated  and one shrunk  with a sense of solemnity  to being oneself  a wedge shaped core of darkness  something invisible to others  although she continued to knit  and sat upright  it was thus that she felt herself  and this self having she would its attachments was free for the strangest adventures  when life sank down for a moment  the range of experience seemed limitless  and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources  she supposed  one after another  she  lily  augustus carmichael  must feel  our apparitions  the things you know us by  are simply childish  beneath it is all dark  it is all spreading  it is unfathomably deep  but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by  her horizon seemed to her limitless  there were all the places she had not seen  the indian plains  she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in rome  this core of darkness could go anywhere  for no one saw it  they could not stop it  she thought  exulting  there was freedom  there was peace  there was  most welcome of all  a summoning together  a resting on a platform of stability  not as oneself did one find rest ever  in her experience  she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles  but as a wedge of darkness  losing personality  one lost the fret  the hurry  the stir  and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace  this rest  this eternity  and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the lighthouse  the long steady stroke  the last of the three  which was her stroke  for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw  and this thing  the long steady stroke  was her stroke  often she found herself sitting and looking  sitting and looking  with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at    that light  for example  and it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that     children do not forget  children do not forget     which she would repeat and begin adding to it  it will end  it will end  she said  it will come  it will come  when suddenly she added  we are in the hands of the lord ,2828,512,3.8,0.9950172398421188,1.2241379310344829,0.9950172398421188,0.14638948633603238,3.8,0.993507672956966,1.1129032258064515,0.993507672956966,0.12642559297835854,82.93695544088983,1.4324700312447043,1.3145668556221164,1.4324700312447043,0.2904424339808415,1.2079809523809533,0.2660912421362737,0.3989022132796784,0.2660912421362737,-0.061667568648360475,8.282000000000009,1.1861448540004385,1.4445640473627568,1.1861448540004385,-0.05119775513865835,36.958532720222905,1.13881246381122,1.1224402895050019,1.13881246381122,0.09877869711449708,0.7893394060633733,0.2369905936285294,0.3539825818671942,0.2369905936285294,-0.06141169009847399,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.9657}",0.9657,1.1420871766837546,0.5659882406151061,1.1420871766837546,-0.04242276044154762,0.10978535353535354,0.09782445745109104,0.15161921411921414,0.09782445745109104,-0.1249293021236917,0.3867903448167111,0.4709714931085897,0.6257882713702875,0.4709714931085897,-0.1802613527685913,79.56541213118803,2.557784741535422,2.2091824342665034,2.557784741535422,-0.7142071467315508,-0.9227,-0.6531925413598252,0.016047864012525198,-0.6531925413598252,0.18930366152060693
148,148,10,"But instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that. Who had said it? Not she; she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean. She looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes, searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart, purifying out of existence that lie, any lie.

How could any Lord have made this world? she asked. With her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason, order, justice: but suffering, death, the poor. There was no treachery too base for the world to commit; she knew that. No happiness lasted; she knew that. She knitted with firm composure, slightly pursing her lips and, without being aware of it, so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed, though he was chuckling at the thought that Hume, the philosopher, grown enormously fat, had stuck in a bog, he could not help noting, as he passed, the sternness at the heart of her beauty. It saddened him, and her remoteness pained him, and he felt, as he passed, that he could not protect her, and, when he reached the hedge, he was sad. He could do nothing to help her.

With some irony in her interrogation, for when one woke at all, one's relations changed, she looked at the steady light, the pitiless, the remorseless, which was so much her, yet so little her, which had her at its beck and call (she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed, stroking the floor), but for all that she thought, watching it with fascination, hypnotised, as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight, she had known happiness, exquisite happiness, intense happiness, and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly, as daylight faded, and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt, It is enough!

153,153,11,"She supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices, Mrs. Ramsay said, wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs; did they plant them? ""Oh, he has his dissertation to write,"" said Mr. Ramsay. She knew all about THAT, said Mrs. Ramsay. He talked of nothing else. It was about the influence of somebody upon something. ""Well, it's all he has to count on,"" said Mr. Ramsay. ""Pray Heaven he won't fall in love with Prue,"" said Mrs. Ramsay. He'd disinherit her if she married him, said Mr. Ramsay. He did not look at the flowers, which his wife was considering, but at a spot about a foot or so above them. There was no harm in him, he added, and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in England who admired his -  when he choked it back. He would not bother her again about his books. These flowers seemed creditable, Mr. Ramsay said, lowering his gaze and noticing something red, something brown. Yes, but then these she had put in with her own hands, said Mrs. Ramsay. The question was, what happened if she sent bulbs down; did Kennedy plant them? It was his incurable laziness; she added, moving on. If she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand, he did sometimes do a stroke of work. So they strolled along, towards the red-hot pokers. ""You're teaching your daughters to exaggerate,"" said Mr. Ramsay, reproving her. Her Aunt Camilla was far worse than she was, Mrs. Ramsay remarked. ""Nobody ever held up your Aunt Camilla as a model of virtue that I'm aware of,"" said Mr. Ramsay. ""She was the most beautiful woman I ever saw,"" said Mrs. Ramsay. ""Somebody else was that,"" said Mr. Ramsay. Prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was, said Mrs. Ramsay. He saw no trace of it, said Mr. Ramsay. ""Well, then, look tonight,"" said Mrs. Ramsay. They paused. He wished Andrew could be induced to work harder. He would lose every chance of a scholarship if he didn't. ""Oh, scholarships!"" she said. Mr. Ramsay thought her foolish for saying that, about a serious thing, like a scholarship. He should be very proud of Andrew if he got a scholarship, he said. She would be just as proud of him if he didn't, she answered. They disagreed always about this, but it did not matter. She liked him to believe in scholarships, and he liked her to be proud of Andrew whatever he did.

He held his watch open for a moment, deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace. To begin with, it was not reasonable to be so nervous. Andrew could look after himself. Then, he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now -  here he became uncomfortable, as if he were breaking into that solitude, that aloofness, that remoteness of hers. But she pressed him. What had he wanted to tell her, she asked, thinking it was about going to the Lighthouse; that he was sorry he had said ""Damn you."" But no. He did not like to see her look so sad, he said. Only wool gathering, she protested, flushing a little. They both felt uncomfortable, as if they did not know whether to go on or go back.

155,155,11,"They had reached the gap between the two clumps of red-hot pokers, and there was the Lighthouse again, but she would not let herself look at it. Had she known that he was looking at her, she thought, she would not have let herself sit there, thinking. She disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking. So she looked over her shoulder, at the town. The lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind. And all the poverty, all the suffering had turned to that, Mrs. Ramsay thought. The lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk. Well, if he could not share her thoughts, Mr. Ramsay said to himself, he would be off, then, on his own. He wanted to go on thinking, telling himself the story how Hume was stuck in a bog; he wanted to laugh. But first it was nonsense to be anxious about Andrew. When he was Andrew's age he used to walk about the country all day long, with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him, or thought that he had fallen over a cliff. He said aloud he thought he would be off for a day's walk if the weather held. He had had about enough of Bankes and of Carmichael. He would like a little solitude. Yes, she said. It annoyed him that she did not protest. She knew that he would never do it. He was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket. She worried about the boys, but not about him. Years ago, before he had married, he thought, looking across the bay, as they stood between the clumps of red-hot pokers, he had walked all day. He had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house. He had worked ten hours at a stretch; an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire. That was the country he liked best, over there; those sandhills dwindling away into darkness. One could walk all day without meeting a soul. There was not a house scarcely, not a single village for miles on end. One could worry things out alone. There were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time. The seals sat up and looked at you. It sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there, alone -  he broke off, sighing. He had no right. The father of eight children -  he reminded himself. And he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered. Andrew would be a better man than he had been. Prue would be a beauty, her mother said. They would stem the flood a bit.

165,165,12,"She had been to Brussels; she had been to Paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill. She had been to Dresden; there were masses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily Briscoe reflected, perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they only made one hopelessly discontented with one's own work. Mr. Bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far. We can't all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins, he said; at the same time he doubted whether you could have your Darwin and your Titian if it weren't for humble people like ourselves. Lily would have liked to pay him a compliment; you're not humble, Mr. Bankes, she would have liked to have said. But he did not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures. Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting, because it interested her. Yes, said Mr. Bankes, he was sure she would, and, as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw the Ramsays. So that is marriage, Lily thought, a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball. That is what Mrs. Ramsay tried to tell me the other night, she thought. For she was wearing a green shawl, and they were standing close together watching Prue and Jasper throwing catches. And suddenly the meaning which, for no reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the Tube or ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical, making them representative, came upon them, and made them in the dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife. Then, after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again, and they became, as they met them, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay watching the children throwing catches. But still for a moment, though Mrs. Ramsay greeted them with her usual smile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought) and said, ""I have triumphed tonight,"" meaning that for once Mr. Bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly; still, for one moment, there was a sense of things having been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches. In the failing light they all looked sharp-edged and ethereal and divided by great distances. Then, darting backwards over the vast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether), Prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand, and her mother said, ""Haven't they come back yet?"" whereupon the spell was broken. Mr. Ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that Hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the Lord's Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study. Mrs. Ramsay, bringing Prue back into throwing catches again, from which she had escaped, asked,",she had been to brussels  she had been to paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill  she had been to dresden  there were masses of pictures she had not seen  however  lily briscoe reflected  perhaps it was better not to see pictures  they only made one hopelessly discontented with one own own work  mr  bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far  we cannot all be titians and we cannot all be darwins  he said  at the same time he doubted whether you could have your darwin and your titian if it were not for humble people like ourselves  lily would have liked to pay him a compliment  you are not humble  mr  bankes  she would have liked to have said  but he did not want compliments  most men do  she thought   and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures  anyhow  said lily  tossing off her little insincerity  she would always go on painting  because it interested her  yes  said mr  bankes  he was sure she would  and  as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw the ramsays  so that is marriage  lily thought  a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball  that is what mrs  ramsay tried to tell me the other night  she thought  for she was wearing a green shawl  and they were standing close together watching prue and jasper throwing catches  and suddenly the meaning which  for no reason at all  as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell  descends on people  making them symbolical  making them representative  came upon them  and made them in the dusk standing  looking  the symbols of marriage  husband and wife  then  after an instant  the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again  and they became  as they met them  mr  and mrs  ramsay watching the children throwing catches  but still for a moment  though mrs  ramsay greeted them with her usual smile  oh  she is thinking we are going to get married  lily thought  and said   i have triumphed tonight   meaning that for once mr  bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly  still  for one moment  there was a sense of things having been blown apart  of space  of irresponsibility as the ball soared high  and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches  in the failing light they all looked sharp edged and ethereal and divided by great distances  then  darting backwards over the vast space  for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether   prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand  and her mother said   have not they come back yet   whereupon the spell was broken  mr  ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the lord own prayer  and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study  mrs  ramsay  bringing prue back into throwing catches again  from which she had escaped  asked ,3158,567,8.850000000000003,2.542134821139228,2.9655172413793105,2.542134821139228,0.4027590343379818,8.100000000000001,2.3343983050964408,2.500000000000001,2.3343983050964408,0.33678409784037266,54.38943074404135,0.9603056395604036,0.8620830433452452,0.9603056395604036,0.17199403863771906,-2.668452380952381,-1.4398215638481964,-1.34822266934943,-1.4398215638481964,-0.3679956479565473,21.480000000000015,4.017543471891647,4.2858988159311115,4.017543471891647,0.4975769009029474,73.37488371649286,2.586238040581687,2.4780864640841225,2.586238040581687,0.3276595691523612,2.014139244857121,1.0709379165624906,1.1945894169785083,1.0709379165624906,0.1012486338561358,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9864}",0.9864,1.1740717393002322,0.5847127996381728,1.1740717393002322,-0.06037504161389703,0.1531691919191919,0.3382509733740853,0.3926405384738717,0.3382509733740853,-0.08619413462920154,1.153208314003837,2.6192015487802998,2.594986523650171,2.6192015487802998,0.2053519649162392,89.08692813791113,3.018924799581812,2.5748012016553083,3.018924799581812,-0.6917107214710726,-0.9999,-0.7428406879483737,-0.02711921270409304,-0.7428406879483737,0.19178647833799373

167,167,13,"Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had asked it with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made off, after lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life. She supposed she must go then. She did not want to go. She did not want to be drawn into it all. For as they walked along the road to the cliff Minta kept on taking her hand. Then she would let it go. Then she would take it again. What was it she wanted? Nancy asked herself. There was something, of course, that people wanted; for when Minta took her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw the whole world spread out beneath her, as if it were Constantinople seen through a mist, and then, however heavy-eyed one might be, one must needs ask, ""Is that Santa Sofia?"" ""Is that the Golden Horn?"" So Nancy asked, when Minta took her hand. ""What is it that she wants? Is it that?"" And what was that? Here and there emerged from the mist (as Nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her) a pinnacle, a dome; prominent things, without names. But when Minta dropped her hand, as she did when they ran down the hillside, all that, the dome, the pinnacle, whatever it was that had protruded through the mist, sank down into it and disappeared. Minta, Andrew observed, was rather a good walker. She wore more sensible clothes that most women. She wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers. She would jump straight into a stream and flounder across. He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would not do -  she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days. She seemed to be afraid of nothing -  except bulls. At the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming, which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course. But she did not mind owning up to it in the least; one must admit that. She knew she was an awful coward about bulls, she said. She thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby. She didn't seem to mind what she said or did. Suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about",certainly  nancy had gone with them  since minta doyle had asked it with her dumb look  holding out her hand  as nancy made off  after lunch  to her attic  to escape the horror of family life  she supposed she must go then  she did not want to go  she did not want to be drawn into it all  for as they walked along the road to the cliff minta kept on taking her hand  then she would let it go  then she would take it again  what was it she wanted  nancy asked herself  there was something  of course  that people wanted  for when minta took her hand and held it  nancy  reluctantly  saw the whole world spread out beneath her  as if it were constantinople seen through a mist  and then  however heavy eyed one might be  one must needs ask   is that santa sofia    is that the golden horn   so nancy asked  when minta took her hand   what is it that she wants  is it that   and what was that  here and there emerged from the mist  as nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her  a pinnacle  a dome  prominent things  without names  but when minta dropped her hand  as she did when they ran down the hillside  all that  the dome  the pinnacle  whatever it was that had protruded through the mist  sank down into it and disappeared  minta  andrew observed  was rather a good walker  she wore more sensible clothes that most women  she wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers  she would jump straight into a stream and flounder across  he liked her rashness  but he saw that it would not do    she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days  she seemed to be afraid of nothing    except bulls  at the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming  which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course  but she did not mind owning up to it in the least  one must admit that  she knew she was an awful coward about bulls  she said  she thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby  she did not seem to mind what she said or did  suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about,2095,400,-4.800000000000002,-1.6396780471192949,-1.7413793103448276,-1.6396780471192949,-0.4618218623481782,-2.8,-1.0646035298617618,-1.0161290322580645,-1.0646035298617618,-0.31556669967642925,-100.12208390437378,-1.5952516669630126,-1.5869544802655735,-1.5952516669630126,-0.44879894656112185,1.8104166666666672,0.5312068036358655,0.6704225352112677,0.5312068036358655,0.03226952812583305,1.3820000000000003,-0.29412870740654296,-0.04090419806243261,-0.29412870740654296,-0.3727797213436237,-25.01334376358537,-1.3243579695007854,-1.1845436610662563,-1.3243579695007854,-0.4400545387918659,-2.2982978710180166,-1.8653340147328368,-1.76513020477008,-1.8653340147328368,-0.6509757039247257,"{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.9172}",-0.9172,-1.7672719030536972,-1.137222976028946,-1.7672719030536972,-0.5547124671333514,0.018605006105006112,-0.4074829120667978,-0.35493827160493824,-0.4074829120667978,-0.2416677406587621,0.11392721782546215,-0.2938497846452069,-0.07529340257934934,-0.2938497846452069,-0.32221852287824765,64.84483278943691,1.8448469270804069,1.6439237012685362,1.8448469270804069,-0.6263621991544213,-0.8177,-0.5312617720360225,0.07475956161932458,-0.5312617720360225,0.17375399225345806

But it would not do altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him ""old fellow"" and all that; it would not altogether do. It was the worst of taking women on walks. Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the Pope's Nose, taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves. She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock. Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down. Out on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed, gauntleted, stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging the pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side. And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon, she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotised, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingness.

They must have seen it, she said, with the tears running down her cheeks, the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life. Now she had lost it. She would rather have lost anything than that! She would go back and look for it. They all went back. They poked and peered and looked. They kept their heads very low, and said things shortly and gruffly. Paul Rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting. All this pother about a brooch really didn't do at all, Andrew thought, as Paul told him to make a ""thorough search between this point and that."" The tide was coming in fast. The sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute. There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now. ""We shall be cut off!"" Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified. As if there were any danger of that! It was the same as the bulls all over again -  she had no control over her emotions, Andrew thought. Women hadn't. The wretched Paul had to pacify her. The men (Andrew and Paul at once became manly, and different from usual) took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again. There was nothing more that could be done now. If the brooch was there, it would still be there in the morning, they assured her, but Minta still sobbed, all the way up to the top of the cliff. It was her grandmother's brooch; she would rather have lost anything but that, and yet Nancy felt, it might be true that she minded losing her brooch, but she wasn't crying only for that. She was crying for something else. We might all sit down and cry, she felt. But she did not know what for.",it was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother own brooch     her grandmother own brooch  the sole ornament she possessed    a weeping willow  it was  they must remember it  set in pearls  they must have seen it  she said  with the tears running down her cheeks  the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life  now she had lost it  she would rather have lost anything than that  she would go back and look for it  they all went back  they poked and peered and looked  they kept their heads very low  and said things shortly and gruffly  paul rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting  all this pother about a brooch really did not do at all  andrew thought  as paul told him to make a  thorough search between this point and that   the tide was coming in fast  the sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute  there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now   we shall be cut off   minta shrieked  suddenly terrified  as if there were any danger of that  it was the same as the bulls all over again    she had no control over her emotions  andrew thought  women had not  the wretched paul had to pacify her  the men  andrew and paul at once became manly  and different from usual  took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant rayley own stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again  there was nothing more that could be done now  if the brooch was there  it would still be there in the morning  they assured her  but minta still sobbed  all the way up to the top of the cliff  it was her grandmother own brooch  she would rather have lost anything but that  and yet nancy felt  it might be true that she minded losing her brooch  but she was not crying only for that  she was crying for something else  we might all sit down and cry  she felt  but she did not know what for ,1969,374,-4.199999999999998,-1.4558620968661724,-1.5344827586206893,-1.4558620968661724,-0.437707029812293,-7.7,-2.5925951804393024,-2.5967741935483875,-2.5925951804393024,-0.7320101420706925,-43.25949200342443,-0.6547676355237354,-0.6856713521306178,-0.6547676355237354,-0.20739188211655307,2.333630952380953,0.7614591705730028,0.9062374245472838,0.7614591705730028,0.1065629557608167,12.628999999999996,2.1187171976868333,2.380409041980623,2.1187171976868333,0.3935187053014122,0.0,-0.330162984734906,-0.25338930707811896,-0.330162984734906,-0.18993908283107488,-3.9768717100989672,-3.008249056938578,-2.9171720304451543,-3.008249056938578,-1.0463904143251817,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.9212}",-0.9212,-1.7734524948636443,-1.1408412483039347,-1.7734524948636443,-0.5755639942020238,0.14740010946907495,0.3062796115669009,0.3605900804176664,0.3062796115669009,0.0,0.7022165638673893,1.3550949236046628,1.4362295504763003,1.3550949236046628,0.15820923595674674,60.97869955485083,1.657604800621422,1.4954672089628818,1.657604800621422,-0.6141549449580674,-1.0,-0.7429568124905868,-0.027175128606575696,-0.7429568124905868,0.13331953865447888
175,175,13,"They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her, and said how famous he was for finding things. Once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch. He would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it. It seemed to him that it would be almost dark, and he would be alone on the beach, and somehow it would be rather dangerous. He began telling her, however, that he would certainly find it, and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn: it was lost: she knew that: she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon. And secretly he resolved that he would not tell her, but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to Edinburgh and buy her another, just like it but more beautiful. He would prove what he could do. And as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him -  his marriage, his children, his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the high road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her, and she pressing close to his side (as she did now). As they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through, and he must tell some one -  Mrs. Ramsay of course, for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done. It had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked Minta to marry him. He would go straight to Mrs. Ramsay, because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it. She had made him think he could do anything. Nobody else took him seriously. But she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted. He had felt her eyes on him all day today, following him about (though she never said a word) as if she were saying, ""Yes, you can do it. I believe in you. I expect it of you."" She had made him feel all that, and directly they got back (he looked for the lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her and say, ""I've done it, Mrs. Ramsay; thanks to you."" And so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows. They must be awfully late then. People were getting ready for dinner. The house was all lit up, and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly, as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff. But, good heavens, he said to himself, putting his hand to his tie, I must not make a fool of myself.",they drew ahead together  paul and minta  and he comforted her  and said how famous he was for finding things  once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch  he would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it  it seemed to him that it would be almost dark  and he would be alone on the beach  and somehow it would be rather dangerous  he began telling her  however  that he would certainly find it  and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn  it was lost  she knew that  she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon  and secretly he resolved that he would not tell her  but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to edinburgh and buy her another  just like it but more beautiful  he would prove what he could do  and as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them  the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him    his marriage  his children  his house  and again he thought  as they came out on to the high road  which was shaded with high bushes  how they would retreat into solitude together  and walk on and on  he always leading her  and she pressing close to his side  as she did now   as they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through  and he must tell some one    mrs  ramsay of course  for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done  it had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him  he would go straight to mrs  ramsay  because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it  she had made him think he could do anything  nobody else took him seriously  but she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted  he had felt her eyes on him all day today  following him about  though she never said a word  as if she were saying   yes  you can do it  i believe in you  i expect it of you   she had made him feel all that  and directly they got back  he looked for the lights of the house above the bay  he would go to her and say   I have done it  mrs  ramsay  thanks to you   and so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows  they must be awfully late then  people were getting ready for dinner  the house was all lit up  and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full  and he said to himself  childishly  as he walked up the drive  lights  lights  lights  and repeated in a dazed way  lights  lights  lights  as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff  but  good heavens  he said to himself  putting his hand to his tie  i must not make a fool of myself ,2775,551,6.4499999999999975,1.80687102012674,2.137931034482758,1.80687102012674,0.2805499019081977,6.4499999999999975,1.8198705043917576,1.9677419354838708,1.8198705043917576,0.2577223500079729,13.68004349622652,0.286989011592758,0.2168313469913327,0.286989011592758,0.044516172773132086,5.895833333333335,2.3290874867678824,2.5117370892018784,2.3290874867678824,0.29995098705680906,19.062000000000005,3.4988041281985893,3.7653390742734127,3.4988041281985893,0.4144480985506261,24.52495427484721,0.6446201858846885,0.6595841110391958,0.6446201858846885,-0.01191228633854796,1.0920576045061134,0.4431067468142964,0.5617446819783144,0.4431067468142964,-0.025792571446469983,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.9824}",0.9824,1.1678911474902849,0.5810945273631841,1.1678911474902849,-0.0550724086426011,0.007304496578690127,-0.4701085863911538,-0.41771888008447133,-0.4701085863911538,-0.2647883052478786,-0.12240041279104663,-0.9562639496138664,-0.6825024919866077,-0.9562639496138664,-0.47513349802308796,85.49250960990716,2.8448421884223714,2.4367783415603044,2.8448421884223714,-0.7173798278557696,0.9058,1.47014471300754,1.0384701409080743,1.47014471300754,0.4106373290088151

186,186,15,"But she let them take their time to choose: she let Rose, particularly, take up this and then that, and hold her jewels against the black dress, for this little ceremony of choosing jewels, which was gone through every night, was what Rose liked best, she knew. She had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear. What was the reason, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen, divining, through her own past, some deep, some buried, some quite speechless feeling that one had for one's mother at Rose's age. Like all feelings felt for oneself, Mrs. Ramsay thought, it made one sad. It was so inadequate, what one could give in return; and what Rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was. And Rose would grow up; and Rose would suffer, she supposed, with these deep feelings, and she said she was ready now, and they would go down, and Jasper, because he was the gentleman, should give her his arm, and Rose, as she was the lady, should carry her handkerchief (she gave her the handkerchief), and what else? oh, yes, it might be cold: a shawl. Choose me a shawl, she said, for that would please Rose, who was bound to suffer so. ""There,"" she said, stopping by the window on the landing, ""there they are again."" Joseph had settled on another tree- top. ""Don't you think they mind,"" she said to Jasper, ""having their wings broken?"" Why did he want to shoot poor old Joseph and Mary? He shuffled a little on the stairs, and felt rebuked, but not seriously, for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds; and they did not feel; and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world, but he rather liked her stories about Mary and Joseph. She made him laugh. But how did she know that those were Mary and Joseph? Did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night? he asked. But here, suddenly, like all grown-up people, she ceased to pay him the least attention.

And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her.

207,207,16,"""People soon drift apart,"" said Mr. Bankes, feeling, however, some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the Mannings and the Ramsays. He had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously. But perhaps he was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into a groove. He had friends in all circles...Mrs. Ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot. That was why he preferred dining alone. All those interruptions annoyed him. Well, thought William Bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's friends ask of one. It would have hurt her if he had refused to come. But it was not worth it for him. Looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would have been free to work. Yes, he thought, it is a terrible waste of time. The children were dropping in still. ""I wish one of you would run up to Roger's room,"" Mrs. Ramsay was saying. How trifling it all is, how boring it all is, he thought, compared with the other thing -   work. Here he sat drumming his fingers on the table-cloth when he might have been -  he took a flashing bird's-eye view of his work. What a waste of time it all was to be sure! Yet, he thought, she is one of my oldest friends. I am by way of being devoted to her. Yet now, at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him: her beauty meant nothing to him; her sitting with her little boy at the window -   nothing, nothing. He wished only to be alone and to take up that book. He felt uncomfortable; he felt treacherous, that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her. The truth was that he did not enjoy family life. It was in this sort of state that one asked oneself, What does one live for? Why, one asked oneself, does one take all these pains for the human race to go on? Is it so very desirable? Are we attractive as a species? Not so very, he thought, looking at those rather untidy boys. His favourite, Cam, was in bed, he supposed. Foolish questions, vain questions, questions one never asked if one was occupied. Is human life this? Is human life that? One never had time to think about it.

So, when there is a strife of tongues, at some meeting, the chairman, to obtain unity, suggests that every one shall speak in French. Perhaps it is bad French; French may not contain the words that express the speaker's thoughts; nevertheless speaking French imposes some order, some uniformity. Replying to her in the same language, Mr. Bankes said, ""No, not at all,"" and Mr. Tansley, who had no knowledge of this language, even spoke thus in words of one syllable, at once suspected its insincerity. They did talk nonsense, he thought, the Ramsays; and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy, making a note which, one of these days, he would read aloud, to one or two friends. There, in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe ""staying with the Ramsays"" and what nonsense they talked. It was worth while doing it once, he would say; but not again. The women bored one so, he would say. Of course Ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children. It would shape itself something like that, but now, at this moment, sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him, nothing had shaped itself at all. It was all in scraps and fragments. He felt extremely, even physically, uncomfortable. He wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself. He wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair, looked at this person, then at that person, tried to break into their talk, opened his mouth and shut it again.

And as he was grateful, and as he liked her, and as he was beginning to enjoy himself, so now, Mrs. Ramsay thought, she could return to that dream land, that unreal but fascinating place, the Mannings' drawing-room at Marlow twenty years ago; where one moved about without haste or anxiety, for there was no future to worry about. She knew what had happened to them, what to her. It was like reading a good book again, for she knew the end of that story, since it had happened twenty years ago, and life, which shot down even from this dining-room table in cascades, heaven knows where, was sealed up there, and lay, like a lake, placidly between its banks.

You are all of you wrong. Poor old fogies, you're hopelessly behind the times. He seemed to be rather cocksure, this young man; and his manners were bad.

So they argued about politics, and Lily looked at the leaf on the table-cloth; and Mrs. Ramsay, leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men, wondered why she was so bored by this talk, and wished, looking at her husband at the other end of the table, that he would say something. One word, she said to herself. For if he said a thing, it would make all the difference. He went to the heart of things. He cared about fishermen and their wages. He could not sleep for thinking of them. It was altogether different when he spoke; one did not feel then, pray heaven you don't see how little I care, because one did care. Then, realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak, she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage, and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him. She looked at him thinking to find this in his face; he would be looking magnificent...But not in the least! He was screwing his face up, he was scowling and frowning, and flushing with anger. What on earth was it about? she wondered. What could be the matter? Only that poor old Augustus had asked for another plate of soup -  that was all. It was unthinkable, it was detestable (so he signalled to her across the table) that Augustus should be beginning his soup over again. He loathed people eating when he had finished. She saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes, his brow, and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode, and then -  thank goodness! she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel, and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words. He sat there scowling. He had said nothing, he would have her observe. Let her give him the credit for that! But why after all should poor Augustus not ask for another plate of soup?

She could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there, drinking his soup. If he wanted soup, he asked for soup. Whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same. He did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she wondered what he did feel then, and why he was always content and dignified; and she thought how devoted he was to Andrew, and would call him into his room, and Andrew said, ""show him things."" And there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry, till he reminded one of a cat watching birds, and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word, and her husband said, ""Poor old Augustus -  he's a true poet,"" which was high praise from her husband.",why could he never conceal his feelings  mrs  ramsay wondered  and she wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed  perhaps he had  perhaps he had not  she could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there  drinking his soup  if he wanted soup  he asked for soup  whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same  he did not like her  she knew that  but partly for that very reason she respected him  and looking at him  drinking soup  very large and calm in the failing light  and monumental  and contemplative  she wondered what he did feel then  and why he was always content and dignified  and she thought how devoted he was to andrew  and would call him into his room  and andrew said   show him things   and there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry  till he reminded one of a cat watching birds  and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word  and her husband said   poor old augustus    he is a true poet   which was high praise from her husband ,1043,191,5.65,1.5617830864559108,1.8620689655172409,1.5617830864559108,0.8403247345104605,6.15,1.726319995172725,1.8709677419354842,1.726319995172725,0.8857774426707391,15.994182140438244,0.32526391902590523,0.2535108940620371,0.32526391902590523,0.15014490866230007,3.125,1.1097191499164885,1.2629107981220655,1.1097191499164885,0.5453833602487852,9.919999999999998,1.5375489255344412,1.7972012917115174,1.5375489255344412,0.8528519549208533,45.89479747411331,1.4939984671232565,1.4551044032125673,1.4939984671232565,0.7711394129548029,1.4946919486734234,0.7172542628445814,0.8380814114891002,0.7172542628445814,0.4469684480373526,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.9293}",0.9293,1.0858437912132342,0.533061962912709,1.0858437912132342,0.3227896050337161,0.1282142857142857,0.19995474654078133,0.25400217066883723,0.19995474654078133,0.19269228369389196,0.3181677533824413,0.278625907091692,0.4494726152243296,0.278625907091692,0.09432841650717848,35.87260676816216,0.4416823491129753,0.5314128827256879,0.4416823491129753,-0.2899171204661877,0.9945,1.5731471819506002,1.0880675464101992,1.5731471819506002,0.6394739399874463
226,226,16,"Now eight candles were stood down the table, and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire, and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit. What had she done with it, Mrs. Ramsay wondered, for Rose's arrangement of the grapes and pears, of the horny pink-lined shell, of the bananas, made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea, of Neptune's banquet, of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of Bacchus (in some picture), among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold...Thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth, was like a world in which one could take one's staff and climb hills, she thought, and go down into valleys, and to her pleasure (for it brought them into sympathy momentarily) she saw that Augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit, plunged in, broke off a bloom there, a tassel here, and returned, after feasting, to his hive.

And so tonight, directly he laughed at her, she was not frightened. Besides, she knew, directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened; she wore her golden haze.

236,236,16,"""It is a French recipe of my grandmother's,"" said Mrs. Ramsay, speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice. Of course it was French. What passes for cookery in England is an abomination (they agreed). It is putting cabbages in water. It is roasting meat till it is like leather. It is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables. ""In which,"" said Mr. Bankes, ""all the virtue of the vegetable is contained."" And the waste, said Mrs. Ramsay. A whole French family could live on what an English cook throws away. Spurred on by her sense that William's affection had come back to her, and that everything was all right again, and that her suspense was over, and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock, she laughed, she gesticulated, till Lily thought, How childlike, how absurd she was, sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her, talking about the skins of vegetables. There was something frightening about her. She was irresistible. Always she got her own way in the end, Lily thought. Now she had brought this off -  Paul and Minta, one might suppose, were engaged. Mr. Bankes was dining here. She put a spell on them all, by wishing, so simply, so directly, and Lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit, and supposed that it was partly that belief (for her face was all lit up -  without looking young, she looked radiant) in this strange, this terrifying thing, which made Paul Rayley, sitting at her side, all of a tremor, yet abstract, absorbed, silent. Mrs. Ramsay, Lily felt, as she talked about the skins of vegetables, exalted that, worshipped that; held her hands over it to warm them, to protect it, and yet, having brought it all about, somehow laughed, led her victims, Lily felt, to the altar. It came over her too now -  the emotion, the vibration, of love. How inconspicuous she felt herself by Paul's side! He, glowing, burning; she, aloof, satirical; he, bound for adventure; she, moored to the shore; he, launched, incautious; she solitary, left out -  and, ready to implore a share, if it were a disaster, in his disaster, she said shyly:", it is a french recipe of my grandmother own   said mrs  ramsay  speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice  of course it was french  what passes for cookery in england is an abomination  they agreed   it is putting cabbages in water  it is roasting meat till it is like leather  it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables   in which   said mr  bankes   all the virtue of the vegetable is contained   and the waste  said mrs  ramsay  a whole french family could live on what an english cook throws away  spurred on by her sense that william own affection had come back to her  and that everything was all right again  and that her suspense was over  and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock  she laughed  she gesticulated  till lily thought  how childlike  how absurd she was  sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her  talking about the skins of vegetables  there was something frightening about her  she was irresistible  always she got her own way in the end  lily thought  now she had brought this off    paul and minta  one might suppose  were engaged  mr  bankes was dining here  she put a spell on them all  by wishing  so simply  so directly  and lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit  and supposed that it was partly that belief  for her face was all lit up    without looking young  she looked radiant  in this strange  this terrifying thing  which made paul rayley  sitting at her side  all of a tremor  yet abstract  absorbed  silent  mrs  ramsay  lily felt  as she talked about the skins of vegetables  exalted that  worshipped that  held her hands over it to warm them  to protect it  and yet  having brought it all about  somehow laughed  led her victims  lily felt  to the altar  it came over her too now    the emotion  the vibration  of love  how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul own side  he  glowing  burning  she  aloof  satirical  he  bound for adventure  she  moored to the shore  he  launched  incautious  she solitary  left out    and  ready to implore a share  if it were a disaster  in his disaster  she said shyly ,2112,374,8.4,2.4042728584493864,2.810344827586207,2.4042728584493864,0.6173168936326832,8.4,2.427948814315473,2.5967741935483875,2.427948814315473,0.5873010390681579,101.1330013994152,1.733425195039174,1.6029777189495291,1.733425195039174,0.4848453491469664,5.604166666666666,2.2007329249940497,2.380281690140845,2.2007329249940497,0.4856900904856742,12.956000000000007,2.1888692925535143,2.450807319698602,2.1888692925535143,0.4156218492590208,50.24627451590927,1.6669548176282838,1.6170938130269603,1.6669548176282838,0.3474155951919718,3.4874576957252645,2.074097730120895,2.2057599942992083,2.074097730120895,0.5682513077904466,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.762, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9884}",0.9884,1.1771620352052057,0.5865219357756669,1.1771620352052057,0.05032924498085817,0.19287743506493504,0.5583079095190121,0.6132418892835557,0.5583079095190121,0.0845386778951053,1.0405456162625506,2.303413815231223,2.3055162914678795,2.303413815231223,0.4310716460630449,63.604585593465536,1.7847800571052612,1.5962991790046146,1.7847800571052612,-0.5222495147444217,0.9639,1.5376130720333774,1.0709572802505032,1.5376130720333774,0.4705845834219999

241,241,16,"Such was the complexity of things. For what happened to her, especially staying with the Ramsays, was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time; that's what you feel, was one; that's what I feel, was the other, and then they fought together in her mind, as now. It is so beautiful, so exciting, this love, that I tremble on the verge of it, and offer, quite out of my own habit, to look for a brooch on a beach; also it is the stupidest, the most barbaric of human passions, and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite) into a bully with a crowbar (he was swaggering, he was insolent) in the Mile End Road. Yet, she said to herself, from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love; wreaths heaped and roses; and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this -  love; while the women, judging from her own experience, would all the time be feeling, This is not what we want; there is nothing more tedious, puerile, and inhumane than this; yet it is also beautiful and necessary. Well then, well then? she asked, somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument, as if in an argument like this one threw one's own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on. So she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love.",such was the complexity of things  for what happened to her  especially staying with the ramsays  was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time  that is what you feel  was one  that is what i feel  was the other  and then they fought together in her mind  as now  it is so beautiful  so exciting  this love  that i tremble on the verge of it  and offer  quite out of my own habit  to look for a brooch on a beach  also it is the stupidest  the most barbaric of human passions  and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem own  paul own was exquisite  into a bully with a crowbar  he was swaggering  he was insolent  in the mile end road  yet  she said to herself  from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love  wreaths heaped and roses  and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this    love  while the women  judging from her own experience  would all the time be feeling  this is not what we want  there is nothing more tedious  puerile  and inhumane than this  yet it is also beautiful and necessary  well then  well then  she asked  somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument  as if in an argument like this one threw one own own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on  so she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love ,1396,266,5.25,1.4392391196204966,1.7241379310344829,1.4392391196204966,0.5320424035797997,5.25,1.445668467515626,1.5806451612903232,1.445668467515626,0.5038467358480312,106.08597091087795,1.8153452865793305,1.6814832479029798,1.8153452865793305,0.7150859724142077,10.609116666666667,4.403275201393826,4.636033802816902,4.403275201393826,1.5652036537625054,5.151000000000002,0.5144439089619944,0.7705059203444564,0.5144439089619944,0.02941729594983685,12.821809829591418,0.1794601647601799,0.2239192911514772,0.1794601647601799,0.0028562268094898475,5.089128219823405,3.1646504910596627,3.3050213980884218,3.1646504910596627,1.361677952125408,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9884}",0.9884,1.1771620352052057,0.5865219357756669,1.1771620352052057,0.1818616345174279,0.2408088235294117,0.8239362439671397,0.8795273807528706,0.8239362439671397,0.35538952418727804,1.459858059870771,3.4787249774051845,3.3828779456945863,3.4787249774051845,1.2472793877870771,48.08348731833149,1.0330720145535046,1.00030114509194,1.0330720145535046,-0.3821971780631835,0.8851,1.4461069327694192,1.0268955490941625,1.4461069327694192,0.5187664662012789

244,244,16,"Purposely, however, for she had it on her mind that Lily, who had helped her with Mr. Tansley, was out of things, she exempted her from the rest; said ""Lily anyhow agrees with me,"" and so drew her in, a little fluttered, a little startled. (For she was thinking about love.) They were both out of things, Mrs. Ramsay had been thinking, both Lily and Charles Tansley. Both suffered from the glow of the other two. He, it was clear, felt himself utterly in the cold; no woman would look at him with Paul Rayley in the room. Poor fellow! Still, he had his dissertation, the influence of somebody upon something: he could take care of himself. With Lily it was different. She faded, under Minta's glow; became more inconspicuous than ever, in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little Chinese eyes. Everything about her was so small. Yet, thought Mrs. Ramsay, comparing her with Minta, as she claimed her help (for Lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots -  he would talk by the hour about his boots) of the two, Lily at forty will be the better. There was in Lily a thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which Mrs. Ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared. Obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like William Bankes. But then he cared, well, Mrs. Ramsay sometimes thought that he cared, since his wife's death, perhaps for her. He was not ""in love"" of course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many. Oh, but nonsense, she thought; William must marry Lily. They have so many things in common. Lily is so fond of flowers. They are both cold and aloof and rather self-sufficing.

251,251,16,"""Let us enjoy what we do enjoy,"" he said. His integrity seemed to Mrs. Ramsay quite admirable. He never seemed for a moment to think, But how does this affect me? But then if you had the other temperament, which must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began (and she knew that Mr. Ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want somebody to say, Oh, but your work will last, Mr. Ramsay, or something like that. He showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with some irritation, that, anyhow, Scott (or was it Shakespeare ?) would last him his lifetime. He said it irritably. Everybody, she thought, felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why. Then Minta Doyle, whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading Shakespeare. Mr. Ramsay said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people liked it as much as they said they did. But, he added, there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and Mrs. Ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at Minta, and she, Mrs. Ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about himself, would, in her own way, see that he was taken care of, and praise him, somehow or other. But she wished it was not necessary: perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary. Anyhow, she was free now to listen to what Paul Rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy. They lasted, he said. He had read some of Tolstoi at school. There was one he always remembered, but he had forgotten the name. Russian names were impossible, said Mrs. Ramsay. ""Vronsky,"" said Paul. He remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain. ""Vronsky,"" said Mrs. Ramsay; ""Oh, ANNA KARENINA,"" but that did not take them very far; books were not in their line. No, Charles Tansley would put them both right in a second about books, but it was all so mixed up with, Am I saying the right thing? Am I making a good impression? that, after all, one knew more about him than about Tolstoi, whereas, what Paul said was about the thing, simply, not himself, nothing else. Like all stupid people, he had a kind of modesty too, a consideration for what you were feeling, which, once in a way at least, she found attractive. Now he was thinking, not about himself, or about Tolstoi, but whether she was cold, whether she felt a draught, whether she would like a pear.", let us enjoy what we do enjoy   he said  his integrity seemed to mrs  ramsay quite admirable  he never seemed for a moment to think  but how does this affect me  but then if you had the other temperament  which must have praise  which must have encouragement  naturally you began  and she knew that mr  ramsay was beginning  to be uneasy  to want somebody to say  oh  but your work will last  mr  ramsay  or something like that  he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying  with some irritation  that  anyhow  scott  or was it shakespeare    would last him his lifetime  he said it irritably  everybody  she thought  felt a little uncomfortable  without knowing why  then minta doyle  whose instinct was fine  said bluffly  absurdly  that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare  mr  ramsay said grimly  but his mind was turned away again  that very few people liked it as much as they said they did  but  he added  there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless  and mrs  ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow  he would laugh at minta  and she  mrs  ramsay saw  realising his extreme anxiety about himself  would  in her own way  see that he was taken care of  and praise him  somehow or other  but she wished it was not necessary  perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary  anyhow  she was free now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy  they lasted  he said  he had read some of tolstoi at school  there was one he always remembered  but he had forgotten the name  russian names were impossible  said mrs  ramsay   vronsky   said paul  he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain   vronsky   said mrs  ramsay   oh  anna karenina   but that did not take them very far  books were not in their line  no  charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books  but it was all so mixed up with  am i saying the right thing  am i making a good impression  that  after all  one knew more about him than about tolstoi  whereas  what paul said was about the thing  simply  not himself  nothing else  like all stupid people  he had a kind of modesty too  a consideration for what you were feeling  which  once in a way at least  she found attractive  now he was thinking  not about himself  or about tolstoi  but whether she was cold  whether she felt a draught  whether she would like a pear ,2457,444,8.099999999999998,2.3123648833228247,2.7068965517241366,2.3123648833228247,0.4852691760586496,8.099999999999998,2.3343983050964394,2.5,2.3343983050964394,0.4580718844274797,169.16729360545426,2.8586845838744743,2.681334467208885,2.8586845838744743,0.6831488965303198,6.016666666666668,2.3822629480741835,2.566197183098593,2.3822629480741835,0.4235473543391433,12.423000000000005,2.0745235232448294,2.336060279870829,2.0745235232448294,0.24720663422175074,37.28197090969689,1.1516680271815571,1.1344806980653797,1.1516680271815571,0.1459103835750148,5.328106604950624,3.3273671882729823,3.4690374745272052,3.3273671882729823,0.7847024118026178,"{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.9911}",0.9911,1.1813339346769198,0.5889642695612844,1.1813339346769198,0.0,0.07653911564625851,-0.08642104596660269,-0.03308210748686935,-0.08642104596660269,-0.1541564060887046,0.6299006977869652,1.152397279157906,1.2504245683087851,1.152397279157906,0.019794033872963183,72.9789147102328,2.238791652527634,1.956266084941583,2.238791652527634,-0.5968464902712577,-1.0,-0.7429568124905868,-0.027175128606575696,-0.7429568124905868,0.16039444927510746

It was something quite apart from everything else, something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room. It was not about their father, she hoped. No, she thought not. What was it, she wondered, sadly rather, for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there. There was all that hoarded behind those rather set, still, mask-like faces, for they did not join in easily; they were like watchers, surveyors, a little raised or set apart from the grown-up people. But when she looked at Prue tonight, she saw that this was not now quite true of her. She was just beginning, just moving, just descending. The faintest light was on her face, as if the glow of Minta opposite, some excitement, some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her, as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table-cloth, and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it. She kept looking at Minta, shyly, yet curiously, so that Mrs. Ramsay looked from one to the other and said, speaking to Prue in her own mind, You will be as happy as she is one of these days. You will be much happier, she added, because you are my daughter, she meant; her own daughter must be happier than other people's daughters. But dinner was over. It was time to go.

There was a lot in that young man after all. And Lily, she thought, putting her napkin beside her plate, she always has some joke of her own. One need never bother about Lily. She waited. She tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate. Well, were they done now? No. That story had led to another story. Her husband was in great spirits tonight, and wishing, she supposed, to make it all right with old Augustus after that scene about the soup, had drawn him in -   they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college. She looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black, and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely, as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral, for she did not listen to the words.

268,268,17,"Not that she did in fact run or hurry; she went indeed rather slowly. She felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter, and pick out one particular thing; the thing that mattered; to detach it; separate it off; clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things, and so hold it before her, and bring it to the tribunal where, ranged about in conclave, sat the judges she had set up to decide these things. Is it good, is it bad, is it right or wrong? Where are we all going to? and so on. So she righted herself after the shock of the event, and quite unconsciously and incongruously, used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position. Her world was changing: they were still. The event had given her a sense of movement. All must be in order. She must get that right and that right, she thought, insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees' stillness, and now again of the superb upward rise (like the beak of a ship up a wave) of the elm branches as the wind raised them. For it was windy (she stood a moment to look out). It was windy, so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star, and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves. Yes, that was done then, accomplished; and as with all things done, became solemn. Now one thought of it, cleared of chatter and emotion, it seemed always to have been, only was shown now and so being shown, struck everything into stability. They would, she thought, going on again, however long they lived, come back to this night; this moon; this wind; this house: and to her too. It flattered her, where she was most susceptible of flattery, to think how, wound about in their hearts, however long they lived she would be woven; and this, and this, and this, she thought, going upstairs, laughing, but affectionately, at the sofa on the landing (her mother's); at the rocking-chair (her father's); at the map of the Hebrides. All that would be revived again in the lives of Paul and Minta; ""the Rayleys"" -  she tried the new name over; and she felt, with her hand on the nursery door, that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically (the feeling was one of relief and happiness) it was all one stream, and chairs, tables, maps, were hers, were theirs, it did not matter whose, and Paul and Minta would carry it on when she was dead.",not that she did in fact run or hurry  she went indeed rather slowly  she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter  and pick out one particular thing  the thing that mattered  to detach it  separate it off  clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things  and so hold it before her  and bring it to the tribunal where  ranged about in conclave  sat the judges she had set up to decide these things  is it good  is it bad  is it right or wrong  where are we all going to  and so on  so she righted herself after the shock of the event  and quite unconsciously and incongruously  used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position  her world was changing  they were still  the event had given her a sense of movement  all must be in order  she must get that right and that right  she thought  insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees  stillness  and now again of the superb upward rise  like the beak of a ship up a wave  of the elm branches as the wind raised them  for it was windy  she stood a moment to look out   it was windy  so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star  and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves  yes  that was done then  accomplished  and as with all things done  became solemn  now one thought of it  cleared of chatter and emotion  it seemed always to have been  only was shown now and so being shown  struck everything into stability  they would  she thought  going on again  however long they lived  come back to this night  this moon  this wind  this house  and to her too  it flattered her  where she was most susceptible of flattery  to think how  wound about in their hearts  however long they lived she would be woven  and this  and this  and this  she thought  going upstairs  laughing  but affectionately  at the sofa on the landing  her mother own   at the rocking chair  her father own   at the map of the hebrides  all that would be revived again in the lives of paul and minta   the rayleys     she tried the new name over  and she felt  with her hand on the nursery door  that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically  the feeling was one of relief and happiness  it was all one stream  and chairs  tables  maps  were hers  were theirs  it did not matter whose  and paul and minta would carry it on when she was dead ,2503,466,8.249999999999998,2.3583188708861056,2.7586206896551717,2.3583188708861056,0.4683780472971798,8.249999999999998,2.381173559705956,2.548387096774193,2.381173559705956,0.4415412973724799,13.989010772714494,0.2920992040771315,0.22172853834570308,0.2920992040771315,0.05382487474226117,4.532738095238097,1.7292263715391618,1.8973843058350104,1.7292263715391618,0.2577521530739155,7.123000000000002,0.9375018021641056,1.1950484391819165,0.9375018021641056,-0.07370644097293715,49.540302234252216,1.6388948305893274,1.5908130738313913,1.6388948305893274,0.23526899326047904,2.5606275397849716,1.4430333693335062,1.5696562495126345,1.4430333693335062,0.2584108714309211,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.9716}",0.9716,1.1512035496034267,0.5713251922207144,1.1512035496034267,-0.018047698823748504,0.14451258617925286,0.2902774045220524,0.3445482843630993,0.2902774045220524,-0.058403349921864536,0.6335730963210928,1.1626908229220023,1.2598602562308072,1.1626908229220023,0.0019687419724887705,76.3387085298395,2.4015110677870686,2.0852795397462334,2.4015110677870686,-0.6040453416815927,0.9723,1.5473675335792818,1.0756542160590472,1.5473675335792818,0.4390620528314408
269,269,17,"She turned the handle, firmly, lest it should squeak, and went in, pursing her lips slightly, as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud. But directly she came in she saw, with annoyance, that the precaution was not needed. The children were not asleep. It was most annoying. Mildred should be more careful. There was James wide awake and Cam sitting bolt upright, and Mildred out of bed in her bare feet, and it was almost eleven and they were all talking. What was the matter? It was that horrid skull again.

But she wanted something more, though she did not know, could not think what it was that she wanted. She looked at her husband (taking up her stocking and beginning to knit), and saw that he did not want to be interrupted -   that was clear. He was reading something that moved him very much. He was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion. He was tossing the pages over. He was acting it -  perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book. She wondered what book it was. Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting. For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above), had been saying that people don't read Scott any more. Then her husband thought, ""That's what they'll say of me;"" so he went and got one of those books. And if he came to the conclusion ""That's true"" what Charles Tansley said, he would accept it about Scott. (She could see that he was weighing, considering, putting this with that as he read.) But not about himself. He was always uneasy about himself. That troubled her. He would always be worrying about his own books -  will they be read, are they good, why aren't they better, what do people think of me? Not liking to think of him so, and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting, wondering if the children were laughing at that, she twitched the stockings out, and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead, and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now, when the breeze falls, settles, leaf by leaf, into quiet.",of course  she said to herself  coming into the room  she had to come here to get something she wanted  first she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp  but she wanted something more  though she did not know  could not think what it was that she wanted  she looked at her husband  taking up her stocking and beginning to knit   and saw that he did not want to be interrupted     that was clear  he was reading something that moved him very much  he was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion  he was tossing the pages over  he was acting it    perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book  she wondered what book it was  oh  it was one of old sir walter own she saw  adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting  for charles tansley had been saying  she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above   had been saying that people do not read scott any more  then her husband thought   that is what they will say of me   so he went and got one of those books  and if he came to the conclusion  that is true  what charles tansley said  he would accept it about scott   she could see that he was weighing  considering  putting this with that as he read   but not about himself  he was always uneasy about himself  that troubled her  he would always be worrying about his own books    will they be read  are they good  why are not they better  what do people think of me  not liking to think of him so  and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting  wondering if the children were laughing at that  she twitched the stockings out  and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead  and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now  when the breeze falls  settles  leaf by leaf  into quiet ,1934,360,1.85,0.3976154015194727,0.5517241379310345,0.3976154015194727,0.0748959739091318,2.35,0.5413468783983061,0.6451612903225807,0.5413468783983061,0.0990238798788984,43.513558347506816,0.7804231548729414,0.6896983530409398,0.7804231548729414,0.2167225183267137,10.469345238095238,4.3417655998071245,4.573038229376258,4.3417655998071245,1.0968680944340767,19.272,3.54385593224141,3.8105489773950487,3.54385593224141,0.8932029711581416,18.87456881068005,0.4200366618439268,0.44924114064712495,0.4200366618439268,0.01976327216283916,1.5014005979969738,0.7218220787167546,0.8426857037964011,0.7218220787167546,0.15126873592584553,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.6829}",0.6829,0.7051193357204791,0.3101763907734056,0.7051193357204791,-0.04109744057109204,0.19532407407407407,0.5718668041351168,0.626834328223217,0.5718668041351168,0.10320701471794842,0.8176572488856747,1.6786692122746385,1.7328374123993515,1.6786692122746385,0.27695707229998234,60.222846208545285,1.6209977880675617,1.4664430316566832,1.6209977880675617,-0.5586401779934269,-0.8625,-0.5832855669475118,0.049709237307090134,-0.5832855669475118,0.1511725413255026

Their eyes met for a second; but they did not want to speak to each other. They had nothing to say, but something seemed, nevertheless, to go from him to her. It was the life, it was the power of it, it was the tremendous humour, she knew, that made him slap his thighs. Don't interrupt me, he seemed to be saying, don't say anything; just sit there. And he went on reading. His lips twitched. It filled him. It fortified him. He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening, and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably, and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn't exist at all. But now, he felt, it didn't matter a damn who reached Z (if thought ran like an alphabet from A to Z). Somebody would reach it -  if not he, then another. This man's strength and sanity, his feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in Mucklebackit's cottage made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears. Raising the book a little to hide his face, he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him.",she read and turned the page  swinging herself  zigzagging this way and that  from one line to another as from one branch to another  from one red and white flower to another  until a little sound roused her    her husband slapping his thighs  their eyes met for a second  but they did not want to speak to each other  they had nothing to say  but something seemed  nevertheless  to go from him to her  it was the life  it was the power of it  it was the tremendous humour  she knew  that made him slap his thighs  do not interrupt me  he seemed to be saying  do not say anything  just sit there  and he went on reading  his lips twitched  it filled him  it fortified him  he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they did not exist at all  but now  he felt  it did not matter a damn who reached z  if thought ran like an alphabet from a to z   somebody would reach it    if not he  then another  this man own strength and sanity  his feeling for straight forward simple things  these fishermen  the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit own cottage made him feel so vigorous  so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears  raising the book a little to hide his face  he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely  but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott own hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view   forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie own drowning and mucklebackit own sorrow  that was scott at his best  and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him ,1872,342,0.20000000000000015,-0.10787846167661236,-0.01724137931034476,-0.10787846167661236,-0.0677190614863745,0.6999999999999997,0.026819077693624,0.11290322580645155,0.026819077693624,-0.03830672925728227,-87.52643397609013,-1.3869247647390521,-1.3873109819876348,-1.3869247647390521,-0.4588757090126103,0.4102182539682533,-0.0849824089069407,0.0393471942767713,-0.0849824089069407,-0.11195351155221524,5.493000000000001,0.5878139898317318,0.8441334768568355,0.5878139898317318,-0.054089229977454835,6.3071300143373294,-0.07947610785084892,-0.018598164017537843,-0.07947610785084892,-0.11617678335394425,0.8396204219395553,0.2712261619689357,0.3884915393989698,0.2712261619689357,0.012479920721238241,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.758, 'pos': 0.151, 'compound': 0.9794}",0.9794,1.1632557036328242,0.5783808231569425,1.1632557036328242,0.07741537342571479,0.16895161290322586,0.42571470713708937,0.48032065505183796,0.42571470713708937,0.06944893007691941,0.9100485161647746,1.937637171312797,1.9702231853932857,1.937637171312797,0.3944998013834352,57.76588502944141,1.502003793839155,1.3720976440953103,1.502003793839155,-0.5374291103348154,0.9778,1.5537543834010046,1.0787295906955938,1.5537543834010046,0.4886834595313493

They could not improve upon that, whatever they might say; and his own position became more secure. The lovers were fiddlesticks, he thought, collecting it all in his mind again. That's fiddlesticks, that's first-rate, he thought, putting one thing beside another. But he must read it again. He could not remember the whole shape of the thing. He had to keep his judgement in suspense. So he returned to the other thought -  if young men did not care for this, naturally they did not care for him either. One ought not to complain, thought Mr. Ramsay, trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him. But he was determined; he would not bother her again. Here he looked at her reading. She looked very peaceful, reading. He liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone.

He wanted something -  wanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him; wanted her to tell him that she loved him. And that, no, she could not do. He found talking so much easier than she did. He could say things -  she never could. So naturally it was always he that said the things, and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly, and would reproach her. A heartless woman he called her; she never told him that she loved him. But it was not so -  it was not so. It was only that she never could say what she felt. Was there no crumb on his coat? Nothing she could do for him? Getting up, she stood at the window with the reddish-brown stocking in her hands, partly to turn away from him, partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is -  the sea at night. But she knew that he had turned his head as she turned; he was watching her. She knew that he was thinking, You are more beautiful than ever. And she felt herself very beautiful. Will you not tell me just for once that you love me? He was thinking that, for he was roused, what with Minta and his book, and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the Lighthouse. But she could not do it; she could not say it. Then, knowing that he was watching her, instead of saying anything she turned, holding her stocking, and looked at him. And as she looked at him she began to smile, for though she had not said a word, he knew, of course he knew, that she loved him. He could not deny it.

Rubbing the glass of the long looking-glass and leering sideways at her swinging figure a sound issued from her lips -  something that had been gay twenty years before on the stage perhaps, had been hummed and danced to, but now, coming from the toothless, bonneted, care-taking woman, was robbed of meaning, was like the voice of witlessness, humour, persistency itself, trodden down but springing up again, so that as she lurched, dusting, wiping, she seemed to say how it was one long sorrow and trouble, how it was getting up and going to bed again, and bringing things out and putting them away again. It was not easy or snug this world she had known for close on seventy years. Bowed down she was with weariness. How long, she asked, creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed, dusting the boards, how long shall it endure? but hobbled to her feet again, pulled herself up, and again with her sidelong leer which slipped and turned aside even from her own face, and her own sorrows, stood and gaped in the glass, aimlessly smiling, and began again the old amble and hobble, taking up mats, putting down china, looking sideways in the glass, as if, after all, she had her consolations, as if indeed there twined about her dirge some incorrigible hope. Visions of joy there must have been at the wash- tub, say with her children (yet two had been base-born and one had deserted her), at the public-house, drinking; turning over scraps in her drawers. Some cleavage of the dark there must have been, some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her, turning to her job again, mumble out the old music hall song. The mystic, the visionary, walking the beach on a fine night, stirring a puddle, looking at a stone, asking themselves ""What am I,"" ""What is this?"" had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them: (they could not say what it was) so that they were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert.

329,329,24,"And now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house again. Flies wove a web in the sunny rooms; weeds that had grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane. When darkness fell, the stroke of the Lighthouse, which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness, tracing its pattern, came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again. But in the very lull of this loving caress, as the long stroke leant upon the bed, the rock was rent asunder; another fold of the shawl loosened; there it hung, and swayed.

She laid them on the table while she dusted. She was fond of flowers. It was a pity to let them waste. Suppose the house were sold (she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking-glass) it would want seeing to -  it would. There it had stood all these years without a soul in it. The books and things were mouldy, for, what with the war and help being hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished. It was beyond one person's strength to get it straight now. She was too old. Her legs pained her. All those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun; there was plaster fallen in the hall; the rain-pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in; the carpet was ruined quite. But people should come themselves; they should have sent somebody down to see. For there were clothes in the cupboards; they had left clothes in all the bedrooms. What was she to do with them? They had the moth in them -  Mrs. Ramsay's things. Poor lady! She would never want THEM again. She was dead, they said; years ago, in London. There was the old grey cloak she wore gardening (Mrs. McNab fingered it). She could see her, as she came up the drive with the washing, stooping over her flowers (the garden was a pitiful sight now, all run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds) -  she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak. There were boots and shoes; and a brush and comb left on the dressing-table, for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow. (She had died very sudden at the end, they said.) And once they had been coming, but had put off coming, what with the war, and travel being so difficult these days; they had never come all these years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came, and expected to find things as they had left them, ah, dear!

It had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished. She had locked the door; she had gone. It was beyond the strength of one woman, she said. They never sent. They never wrote. There were things up there rotting in the drawers -  it was a shame to leave them so, she said. The place was gone to rack and ruin. Only the Lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw. Nothing now withstood them; nothing said no to them. Let the wind blow; let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage. Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the arm-chairs.

363,363,30,"Suddenly Mr. Ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her, with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating, as if he saw you, for one second, for the first time, for ever; and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him -  to escape his demand on her, to put aside a moment longer that imperious need. And he shook his head at her, and strode on (""Alone"" she heard him say, ""Perished"" she heard him say) and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols, wrote themselves all over the grey-green walls. If only she could put them together, she felt, write them out in some sentence, then she would have got at the truth of things. Old Mr. Carmichael came padding softly in, fetched his coffee, took his cup and made off to sit in the sun. The extraordinary unreality was frightening; but it was also exciting. Going to the Lighthouse. But what does one send to the Lighthouse? Perished. Alone. The grey-green light on the wall opposite. The empty places. Such were some of the parts, but how bring them together? she asked. As if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest Mr. Ramsay should see her. She must escape somewhere, be alone somewhere. Suddenly she remembered. When she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table-cloth, which she had looked at in a moment of revelation. There had been a problem about a foreground of a picture. Move the tree to the middle, she had said. She had never finished that picture. She would paint that picture now. It had been knocking about in her mind all these years. Where were her paints, she wondered? Her paints, yes. She had left them in the hall last night. She would start at once.

365,365,30,"But with Mr. Ramsay bearing down on her, she could do nothing. Every time he approached -  he was walking up and down the terrace -  ruin approached, chaos approached. She could not paint. She stooped, she turned; she took up this rag; she squeezed that tube. But all she did was to ward him off a moment. He made it impossible for her to do anything. For if she gave him the least chance, if he saw her disengaged a moment, looking his way a moment, he would be on her, saying, as he had said last night, ""You find us much changed."" Last night he had got up and stopped before her, and said that. Dumb and staring though they had all sat, the six children whom they used to call after the Kings and Queens of England -  the Red, the Fair, the Wicked, the Ruthless -  she felt how they raged under it. Kind old Mrs. Beckwith said something sensible. But it was a house full of unrelated passions -  she had felt that all the evening. And on top of this chaos Mr. Ramsay got up, pressed her hand, and said: ""You will find us much changed"" and none of them had moved or had spoken; but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it. Only James (certainly the Sullen) scowled at the lamp; and Cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger. Then he reminded them that they were going to the Lighthouse tomorrow. They must be ready, in the hall, on the stroke of half-past seven. Then, with his hand on the door, he stopped; he turned upon them. Did they not want to go? he demanded. Had they dared say No (he had some reason for wanting it) he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair. Such a gift he had for gesture. He looked like a king in exile. Doggedly James said yes. Cam stumbled more wretchedly. Yes, oh, yes, they'd both be ready, they said. And it struck her, this was tragedy -  not palls, dust, and the shroud; but children coerced, their spirits subdued. James was sixteen, Cam, seventeen, perhaps. She had looked round for some one who was not there, for Mrs. Ramsay, presumably. But there was only kind Mrs. Beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp. Then, being tired, her mind still rising and falling with the sea, the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her, the candles wavering in her eyes, she had lost herself and gone under. It was a wonderful night, starlit; the waves sounded as they went upstairs; the moon surprised them, enormous, pale, as they passed the staircase window.

366,366,30,"She set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel, as a barrier, frail, but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off Mr. Ramsay and his exactingness. She did her best to look, when his back was turned, at her picture; that line there, that mass there. But it was out of the question. Let him be fifty feet away, let him not even speak to you, let him not even see you, he permeated, he prevailed, he imposed himself. He changed everything. She could not see the colour; she could not see the lines; even with his back turned to her, she could only think, But he'll be down on me in a moment, demanding -  something she felt she could not give him. She rejected one brush; she chose another. When would those children come? When would they all be off? she fidgeted. That man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never gave; that man took. She, on the other hand, would be forced to give. Mrs. Ramsay had given. Giving, giving, giving, she had died -  and had left all this. Really, she was angry with Mrs. Ramsay. With the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall. It was all Mrs. Ramsay's doing. She was dead.

376,376,31,"Instead, Mr. Ramsay smiled. His pall, his draperies, his infirmities fell from him. Ah, yes, he said, holding his foot up for her to look at, they were first-rate boots. There was only one man in England who could make boots like that. Boots are among the chief curses of mankind, he said. ""Bootmakers make it their business,"" he exclaimed, ""to cripple and torture the human foot."" They are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind. It had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made. He would have her observe (he lifted his right foot and then his left) that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before. They were made of the finest leather in the world, also. Most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard. He looked complacently at his foot, still held in the air.

She could not help feeling annoyed with them; they might have come more cheerfully; they might have given him what, now that they were off, she would not have the chance of giving him. For she felt a sudden emptiness; a frustration. Her feeling had come too late; there it was ready; but he no longer needed it. He had become a very distinguished, elderly man, who had no need of her whatsoever. She felt snubbed. He slung a knapsack round his shoulders. He shared out the parcels -  there were a number of them, ill tied in brown paper. He sent Cam for a cloak. He had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition. Then, wheeling about, he led the way with his firm military tread, in those wonderful boots, carrying brown paper parcels, down the path, his children following him. They looked, she thought, as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise, and they went to it, still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father's wake, obediently, but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence. So they passed the edge of the lawn, and it seemed to Lily that she watched a procession go, drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it, faltering and flagging as it was, a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her.

379,379,31,"But what a face, she thought, immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression. What had made it like that? Thinking, night after night, she supposed -  about the reality of kitchen tables, she added, remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what Mr. Ramsay did think about Andrew had given her. (He had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly, she bethought her.) The kitchen table was something visionary, austere; something bare, hard, not ornamental. There was no colour to it; it was all edges and angles; it was uncompromisingly plain. But Mr. Ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it, never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded, until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her. Then, she recalled (standing where he had left her, holding her brush), worries had fretted it -  not so nobly. He must have had his doubts about that table, she supposed; whether the table was a real table; whether it was worth the time he gave to it; whether he was able after all to find it. He had had doubts, she felt, or he would have asked less of people. That was what they talked about late at night sometimes, she suspected; and then next day Mrs. Ramsay looked tired, and Lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing. But now he had nobody to talk to about that table, or his boots, or his knots; and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour, and his face had that touch of desperation, of exaggeration in it which alarmed her, and made her pull her skirts about her. And then, she recalled, there was that sudden revivification, that sudden flare (when she praised his boots), that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things, which too passed and changed (for he was always changing, and hid nothing) into that other final phase which was new to her and had, she owned, made herself ashamed of her own irritability, when it seemed as if he had shed worries and ambitions, and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise, had entered some other region, was drawn on, as if by curiosity, in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or another, at the head of that little procession out of one's range.

380,380,32,"So they're gone, she thought, sighing with relief and disappointment. Her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her, like a bramble sprung across her face. She felt curiously divided, as if one part of her were drawn out there -  it was a still day, hazy; the Lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance; the other had fixed itself doggedly, solidly, here on the lawn. She saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her. It seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation; this folly and waste of emotion; it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a peace, as her disorderly sensations (he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing) trooped off the field; and then, emptiness. She looked blankly at the canvas, with its uncompromising white stare; from the canvas to the garden. There was something (she stood screwing up her little Chinese eyes in her small puckered face), something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across, slicing down, and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns, which had stayed in her mind; which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time, involuntarily, as she walked along the Brompton Road, as she brushed her hair, she found herself painting that picture, passing her eye over it, and untying the knot in imagination.

382,382,32,"With a curious physical sensation, as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back, she made her first quick decisive stroke. The brush descended. It flickered brown over the white canvas; it left a running mark. A second time she did it -  a third time. And so pausing and so flickering, she attained a dancing rhythmical movement, as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another, and all were related; and so, lightly and swiftly pausing, striking, she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed ( she felt it looming out at her) a space. Down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her. For what could be more formidable than that space? Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers -  this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention. She was half unwilling, half reluctant. Why always be drawn out and haled away? Why not left in peace, to talk to Mr. Carmichael on the lawn? It was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow. Other worshipful objects were content with worship; men, women, God, all let one kneel prostrate; but this form, were it only the shape of a white lamp-shade looming on a wicker table, roused one to perpetual combat, challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted. Always (it was in her nature, or in her sex, she did not know which) before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul, a soul reft of body, hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt. Why then did she do it? She looked at the canvas, lightly scored with running lines. It would be hung in the servants' bedrooms. It would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa. What was the good of doing it then, and she heard some voice saying she couldn't paint, saying she couldn't create, as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind, so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them.",with a curious physical sensation  as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back  she made her first quick decisive stroke  the brush descended  it flickered brown over the white canvas  it left a running mark  a second time she did it    a third time  and so pausing and so flickering  she attained a dancing rhythmical movement  as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another  and all were related  and so  lightly and swiftly pausing  striking  she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed   she felt it looming out at her  a space  down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her  for what could be more formidable than that space  here she was again  she thought  stepping back to look at it  drawn out of gossip  out of living  out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers    this other thing  this truth  this reality  which suddenly laid hands on her  emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention  she was half unwilling  half reluctant  why always be drawn out and haled away  why not left in peace  to talk to mr  carmichael on the lawn  it was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow  other worshipful objects were content with worship  men  women  god  all let one kneel prostrate  but this form  were it only the shape of a white lamp shade looming on a wicker table  roused one to perpetual combat  challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted  always  it was in her nature  or in her sex  she did not know which  before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul  a soul reft of body  hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt  why then did she do it  she looked at the canvas  lightly scored with running lines  it would be hung in the servants  bedrooms  it would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa  what was the good of doing it then  and she heard some voice saying she could not paint  saying she could not create  as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind  so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them ,2423,441,-0.15000000000000002,-0.21510443265760015,-0.13793103448275862,-0.21510443265760015,-0.09668401773664934,1.65,0.32306235688722884,0.41935483870967744,0.32306235688722884,0.0136317372935388,14.106272672409437,0.294038667975496,0.2235871622359436,0.294038667975496,0.05735293200683251,6.614583333333332,2.645389799710536,2.8356807511737085,2.645389799710536,0.4863253396977735,5.655000000000009,0.6225682386647672,0.8790096878363852,0.6225682386647672,-0.13595296006084798,31.07704676509664,0.9050434845486351,0.9034943018434588,0.9050434845486351,0.09191862862569693,0.16157581987605166,-0.1904439516371965,-0.07686525519879067,-0.1904439516371965,-0.15649478097428146,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.7846}",-0.7846,-1.5623852845539434,-1.017277250113071,-1.5623852845539434,-0.491721875516421,0.08334405834405832,-0.04870910703182376,0.00472312972312961,-0.04870910703182376,-0.14261312856750136,0.5056087013139461,0.8040132208013748,0.9310745633935326,0.8040132208013748,-0.06230699938760127,71.73966402496694,2.178773044930481,1.9086798279093302,2.178773044930481,-0.6189939745464724,0.5275,1.0308455698152106,0.8269402818161484,1.0308455698152106,0.38187769027471297

For the mass loomed before her; it protruded; she felt it pressing on her eyeballs. Then, as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted, she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers, moving her brush hither and thither, but it was now heavier and went slower, as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her (she kept looking at the hedge, at the canvas) by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current.

384,384,32,"Charles Tansley used to say that, she remembered, women can't paint, can't write. Coming up behind her, he had stood close beside her, a thing she hated, as she painted her on this very spot. ""Shag tobacco,"" he said, ""fivepence an ounce,"" parading his poverty, his principles. (But the war had drawn the sting of her femininity. Poor devils, one thought, poor devils, of both sexes.) He was always carrying a book about under his arm -  a purple book. He ""worked."" He sat, she remembered, working in a blaze of sun. At dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view. But after all, she reflected, there was the scene on the beach. One must remember that. It was a windy morning. They had all gone down to the beach. Mrs. Ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock. She wrote and wrote. ""Oh,"" she said, looking up at something floating in the sea, ""is it a lobster pot? Is it an upturned boat?"" She was so short-sighted that she could not see, and then Charles Tansley became as nice as he could possibly be. He began playing ducks and drakes. They chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves. Every now and then Mrs. Ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them. What they said she could not remember, but only she and Charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and Mrs. Ramsay watching them. She was highly conscious of that. Mrs. Ramsay, she thought, stepping back and screwing up her eyes. (It must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with James. There must have been a shadow.) When she thought of herself and Charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach, it seemed to depend somehow upon Mrs. Ramsay sitting under the rock, with a pad on her knee, writing letters. (She wrote innumerable letters, and sometimes the wind took them and she and Charles just saved a page from the sea.) But what a power was in the human soul! she thought. That woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity; made these angers, irritations fall off like old rags; she brought together this and that and then this, and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite (she and Charles squabbling, sparring, had been silly and spiteful) something -  this scene on the beach for example, this moment of friendship and liking -  which survived, after all these years complete, so that she dipped into it to re-fashion her memory of him, and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art.",charles tansley used to say that  she remembered  women cannot paint  cannot write  coming up behind her  he had stood close beside her  a thing she hated  as she painted her on this very spot   shag tobacco   he said   fivepence an ounce   parading his poverty  his principles   but the war had drawn the sting of her femininity  poor devils  one thought  poor devils  of both sexes   he was always carrying a book about under his arm    a purple book  he  worked   he sat  she remembered  working in a blaze of sun  at dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view  but after all  she reflected  there was the scene on the beach  one must remember that  it was a windy morning  they had all gone down to the beach  mrs  ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock  she wrote and wrote   oh   she said  looking up at something floating in the sea   is it a lobster pot  is it an upturned boat   she was so short sighted that she could not see  and then charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be  he began playing ducks and drakes  they chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves  every now and then mrs  ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them  what they said she could not remember  but only she and charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and mrs  ramsay watching them  she was highly conscious of that  mrs  ramsay  she thought  stepping back and screwing up her eyes   it must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with james  there must have been a shadow   when she thought of herself and charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach  it seemed to depend somehow upon mrs  ramsay sitting under the rock  with a pad on her knee  writing letters   she wrote innumerable letters  and sometimes the wind took them and she and charles just saved a page from the sea   but what a power was in the human soul  she thought  that woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity  made these angers  irritations fall off like old rags  she brought together this and that and then this  and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite  she and charles squabbling  sparring  had been silly and spiteful  something    this scene on the beach for example  this moment of friendship and liking    which survived  after all these years complete  so that she dipped into it to re fashion her memory of him  and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art ,2546,463,-1.3500000000000014,-0.5827363331638443,-0.5517241379310349,-0.5827363331638443,-0.17734192600624352,-1.3500000000000014,-0.6124427353031024,-0.5483870967741941,-0.6124427353031024,-0.19039576157606405,-42.04292226042955,-0.6346460691622879,-0.6663884853652278,-0.6346460691622879,-0.16281478633537308,-0.6624555555555545,-0.5570369577561773,-0.44411142410015614,-0.5570369577561773,-0.2259879279228443,5.737000000000003,0.640159895481486,0.8966630785791176,0.640159895481486,-0.14687901029424064,12.39497974505632,0.16249512668279306,0.2080299844124643,0.16249512668279306,-0.0828627226525492,0.4811111827720173,0.027122749491914257,0.14243883156093567,0.027122749491914257,-0.10206970706867438,"{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.9389}",-0.9389,-1.8008016136226612,-1.1568521031207597,-1.8008016136226612,-0.5222110866720623,-0.03944869614512473,-0.7292075424450414,-0.6774588396612208,-0.7292075424450414,-0.3332406445362065,-0.15369840019657344,-1.0439905947731625,-0.7629180675298181,-1.0439905947731625,-0.5082585207300809,73.93075175263331,2.2848904238444447,1.9928158828888596,2.2848904238444447,-0.6582287177698476,-0.9908,-0.7322733546069774,-0.022030865578170425,-0.7322733546069774,0.16760694749676625

And, resting, looking from one to the other vaguely, the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually, the vast, the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these, when she released faculties that had been on the strain, stood over her, paused over her, darkened over her. What is the meaning of life? That was all -  a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one. This, that, and the other; herself and Charles Tansley and the breaking wave; Mrs. Ramsay bringing them together; Mrs. Ramsay saying, ""Life stand still here""; Mrs. Ramsay making of the moment something permanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent) -  this was of the nature of a revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape; this eternal passing and flowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability. Life stand still here, Mrs. Ramsay said.

The faint thought she was thinking of Mrs. Ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house; this smoke; this fine early morning air. Faint and unreal, it was amazingly pure and exciting. She hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house, but that she might be left alone to go on thinking, to go on painting. She turned to her canvas. But impelled by some curiosity, driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged, she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether, down there on the beach, she could see that little company setting sail. Down there among the little boats which floated, some with their sails furled, some slowly, for it was very calm moving away, there was one rather apart from the others. The sail was even now being hoisted. She decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat Mr. Ramsay was sitting with Cam and James.

Their heads were bent down, their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale. Speak to him they could not. They must come; they must follow. They must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels. But they vowed, in silence, as they walked, to stand by each other and carry out the great compact -  to resist tyranny to the death. So there they would sit, one at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence.

389,389,33,"But now, when Macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and shot off. Instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, Mr. Ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a little grunt to Macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered, perfectly content. Now they would sail on for hours like this, and Mr. Ramsay would ask old Macalister a question -  about the great storm last winter probably -  and old Macalister would answer it, and they would puff their pipes together, and Macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and never say a word to any one. James would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail. For if he forgot, then the sail puckered and shivered, and the boat slackened, and Mr. Ramsay would say sharply, ""Look out! Look out!"" and old Macalister would turn slowly on his seat. So they heard Mr. Ramsay asking some question about the great storm at Christmas. ""She comes driving round the point,"" old Macalister said, describing the great storm last Christmas, when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen ""one there, one there, one there"" (he pointed slowly round the bay. Mr. Ramsay followed him, turning his head). He had seen four men clinging to the mast. Then she was gone. ""And at last we shoved her off,"" he went on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there, sitting at opposite ends of the boat, united by their compact to fight tyranny to the death). At last they had shoved her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got her out past the point -  Macalister told the story; and though they only caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time of their father -  how he leant forward, how he brought his voice into tune with Macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking there and there where Macalister pointed, he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there. He liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night; pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind; he liked men to work like that, and women to keep house, and sit beside sleeping children indoors, while men were drowned, out there in a storm. So James could tell, so Cam could tell (they looked at him, they looked at each other), from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice, and the little tinge of Scottish accent which came into his voice, making him seem like a peasant himself, as he questioned Macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm.

And seeing her gazing, with her vague, now rather frightened, eyes fixed where no house was Mr. Ramsay forgot his dream; how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace; how the arms were stretched out to him. He thought, women are always like that; the vagueness of their minds is hopeless; it was a thing he had never been able to understand; but so it was. It had been so with her -  his wife. They could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds. But he had been wrong to be angry with her; moreover, did he not rather like this vagueness in women? It was part of their extraordinary charm. I will make her smile at me, he thought. She looks frightened. She was so silent. He clutched his fingers, and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves. He would make her smile at him. He would find some simple easy thing to say to her. But what? For, wrapped up in his work as he was, he forgot the sort of thing one said. There was a puppy. They had a puppy. Who was looking after the puppy today? he asked. Yes, thought James pitilessly, seeing his sister's head against the sail, now she will give way. I shall be left to fight the tyrant alone. The compact would be left to him to carry out. Cam would never resist tyranny to the death, he thought grimly, watching her face, sad, sulky, yielding. And as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding hills is gloom and sorrow, and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded, the darkened, either in pity, or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay: so Cam now felt herself overcast, as she sat there among calm, resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy; how to resist his entreaty -  forgive me, care for me; while James the lawgiver, with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee (his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her), said, Resist him. Fight him. He said so rightly; justly. For they must fight tyranny to the death, she thought. Of all human qualities she reverenced justice most. Her brother was most god-like, her father most suppliant. And to which did she yield, she thought, sitting between them, gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her, and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there.",but cam could see nothing  she was thinking how all those paths and the lawn  thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there  were gone  were rubbed out  were past  were

399,399,33,"And what was she going to call him? her father persisted. He had had a dog when he was a little boy, called Frisk. She'll give way, James thought, as he watched a look come upon her face, a look he remembered. They look down he thought, at their knitting or something. Then suddenly they look up. There was a flash of blue, he remembered, and then somebody sitting with him laughed, surrendered, and he was very angry. It must have been his mother, he thought, sitting on a low chair, with his father standing over her. He began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down, leaf upon leaf, fold upon fold softly, incessantly upon his brain; among scents, sounds; voices, harsh, hollow, sweet; and lights passing, and brooms tapping; and the wash and hush of the sea, how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead, upright, over them. Meanwhile, he noticed, Cam dabbled her fingers in the water, and stared at the shore and said nothing. No, she won't give way, he thought; she's different, he thought. Well, if Cam would not answer him, he would not bother her Mr. Ramsay decided, feeling in his pocket for a book. But she would answer him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say, Oh, yes, Frisk. I'll call him Frisk. She wanted even to say, Was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone? But try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that, fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father, unsuspected by James, a private token of the love she felt for him. For she thought, dabbling her hand (and now Macalister's boy had caught a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills) for she thought, looking at James who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this extraordinary temptation. Her father was feeling in his pockets; in another second, he would have found his book. For no one attracted her more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and his words, and his haste, and his temper, and his oddity, and his passion, and his saying straight out before every one, we perish, each alone, and his remoteness. (He had opened his book.) But what remained intolerable, she thought, sitting upright, and watching Macalister's boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: ""Do this,"" ""Do that,"" his dominance: his ""Submit to me.""",and what was she going to call him  her father persisted  he had had a dog when he was a little boy  called frisk  she will give way  james thought  as he watched a look come upon her face  a look he remembered  they look down he thought  at their knitting or something  then suddenly they look up  there was a flash of blue  he remembered  and then somebody sitting with him laughed  surrendered  and he was very angry  it must have been his mother  he thought  sitting on a low chair  with his father standing over her  he began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down  leaf upon leaf  fold upon fold softly  incessantly upon his brain  among scents  sounds  voices  harsh  hollow  sweet  and lights passing  and brooms tapping  and the wash and hush of the sea  how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead  upright  over them  meanwhile  he noticed  cam dabbled her fingers in the water  and stared at the shore and said nothing  no  she will not give way  he thought  she is different  he thought  well  if cam would not answer him  he would not bother her mr  ramsay decided  feeling in his pocket for a book  but she would answer him  she wished  passionately  to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say  oh  yes  frisk  I will call him frisk  she wanted even to say  was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone  but try as she might  she could think of nothing to say like that  fierce and loyal to the compact  yet passing on to her father  unsuspected by james  a private token of the love she felt for him  for she thought  dabbling her hand  and now macalister own boy had caught a mackerel  and it lay kicking on the floor  with blood on its gills  for she thought  looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail  or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon  you are not exposed to it  to this pressure and division of feeling  this extraordinary temptation  her father was feeling in his pockets  in another second  he would have found his book  for no one attracted her more  his hands were beautiful  and his feet  and his voice  and his words  and his haste  and his temper  and his oddity  and his passion  and his saying straight out before every one  we perish  each alone  and his remoteness   he had opened his book   but what remained intolerable  she thought  sitting upright  and watching macalister own boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish  was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms  so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his  some insolence   do this    do that   his dominance  his  submit to me  ,2730,494,-4.3,-1.4864980885750263,-1.568965517241379,-1.4864980885750263,-0.35861922011506503,-4.3,-1.5323560759569272,-1.5,-1.5323560759569272,-0.3678036857993544,-124.71236304066866,-2.0019648343227585,-1.976715181646855,-2.0019648343227585,-0.4526520580206582,-1.0054833333333335,-0.7079941466461815,-0.5987154929577468,-0.7079941466461815,-0.2522003425807101,18.477999999999987,3.3735172064795016,3.6396124865446686,3.3735172064795016,0.4854743410288228,-30.83259202839926,-1.5556532131382257,-1.4011727695106793,-1.5556532131382257,-0.4395777510485198,-1.4248157722632517,-1.2705935234173902,-1.1656403948401841,-1.2705935234173902,-0.4194756676237237,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.9094}",0.9094,1.055095346958746,0.5150610583446403,1.055095346958746,-0.04796866568010723,0.11116071428571428,0.10544649380529368,0.15926010717677386,0.10544649380529368,-0.11756176985155775,0.5560814260270498,0.9454856660982054,1.0607568063585076,0.9454856660982054,-0.06859120708814942,77.88992888372444,2.47663879361646,2.144845188045872,2.47663879361646,-0.6844835411770744,-0.5738,-0.24803401357816066,0.2111384477745471,-0.24803401357816066,0.23044867996896204

Out and out one went, further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank, perfectly alone, over the sea. And as she dipped into the blue paint, she dipped too into the past there. Now Mrs. Ramsay got up, she remembered. It was time to go back to the house -  time for luncheon. And they all walked up from the beach together, she walking behind with William Bankes, and there was Minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking. How that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them! How William Bankes deplored it, without, so far as she could remember, saying anything about it! It meant to him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants leaving and beds not made at mid-day -  all the things he most abhorred. He had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did now -  holding his hand in front of him.

412,412,34,"Minta was bored by hares, Lily thought. But Minta never gave herself away. She never said things like that about playing chess in coffee- houses. She was far too conscious, far too wary. But to go on with their story -  they had got through the dangerous stage by now. She had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and Minta had to hand him his tools. He sat on the road mending the car, and it was the way she gave him the tools -  business-like, straightforward, friendly -  that proved it was all right now.

417,417,34,"She had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she thought. She had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody, and she had felt an enormous exultation. She had felt, now she could stand up to Mrs. Ramsay -  a tribute to the astonishing power that Mrs. Ramsay had over one. Do this, she said, and one did it. Even her shadow at the window with James was full of authority. She remembered how William Bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son. Did she not admire their beauty? he said. But William, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed a shadow there and so on. She did not intend to disparage a subject which, they agreed, Raphael had treated divinely. She was not cynical. Quite the contrary.

She sat musing, pondering (she was in grey that day, Lily thought). Her eyes were bent. She would never lift them. Yes, thought Lily, looking intently, I must have seen her look like that, but not in grey; nor so still, nor so young, nor so peaceful. The figure came readily enough. She was astonishingly beautiful, as William said. But beauty was not everything. Beauty had this penalty -  it came too readily, came too completely. It stilled life -  froze it. One forgot the little agitations; the flush, the pallor, some queer distortion, some light or shadow, which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after. It was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty.

421,421,34,"She wanted to go straight up to him and say, ""Mr. Carmichael!"" Then he would look up benevolently as always, from his smoky vague green eyes. But one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them. And she wanted to say not one thing, but everything. Little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing. ""About life, about death; about Mrs. Ramsay"" -  no, she thought, one could say nothing to nobody. The urgency of the moment always missed its mark. Words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low. Then one gave it up; then the idea sunk back again; then one became like most middle-aged people, cautious, furtive, with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension. For how could one express in words these emotions of the body? express that emptiness there? (She was looking at the drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily empty.) It was one's body feeling, not one's mind. The physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant.

Oh, Mrs. Ramsay! she called out silently, to that essence which sat by the boat, that abstract one made of her, that woman in grey, as if to abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come back again. It had seemed so safe, thinking of her.

He was an inscrutable old man, with the yellow stain on his beard, and his poetry, and his puzzles, sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants, so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted. She looked at her picture. That would have been his answer, presumably -  how ""you"" and ""I"" and ""she"" pass and vanish; nothing stays; all changes; but not words, not paint. Yet it would be hung in the attics, she thought; it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa; yet even so, even of a picture like that, it was true. One might say, even of this scrawl, not of that actual picture, perhaps, but of what it attempted, that it ""remained for ever,"" she was going to say, or, for the words spoken sounded even to herself, too boastful, to hint, wordlessly; when, looking at the picture, she was surprised to find that she could not see it. Her eyes were full of a hot liquid (she did not think of tears at first) which, without disturbing the firmness of her lips, made the air thick, rolled down her cheeks. She had perfect control of herself -  Oh, yes! -  in every other way. Was she crying then for Mrs. Ramsay, without being aware of any unhappiness? She addressed old Mr. Carmichael again. What was it then? What did it mean? Could things thrust their hands up and grip one; could the blade cut; the fist grasp? Was there no safety? No learning by heart of the ways of the world? No guide, no shelter, but all was miracle, and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air? Could it be, even for elderly people, that this was life? -  startling, unexpected, unknown? For one moment she felt that if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and demanded an explanation, why was it so short, why was it so inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll itself up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into shape; if they shouted loud enough Mrs. Ramsay would return.

426,426,36,"And now slowly the pain of the want, and the bitter anger (to be called back, just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for Mrs. Ramsay again. Had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast? not in the least) lessened; and of their anguish left, as antidote, a relief that was balm in itself, and also, but more mysteriously, a sense of some one there, of Mrs. Ramsay, relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her, staying lightly by her side and then (for this was Mrs. Ramsay in all her beauty) raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went. Lily squeezed her tubes again. She attacked that problem of the hedge. It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds, purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinth or lilies, she vanished. It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion, a shade across the fields. The sight, the phrase, had its power to console. Wherever she happened to be, painting, here, in the country or in London, the vision would come to her, and her eyes, half closing, sought something to base her vision on. She looked down the railway carriage, the omnibus; took a line from shoulder or cheek; looked at the windows opposite; at Piccadilly, lamp-strung in the evening. All had been part of the fields of death. But always something -  it might be a face, a voice, a paper boy crying STANDARD, NEWS -  thrust through, snubbed her, waked her, required and got in the end an effort of attention, so that the vision must be perpetually remade. Now again, moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue, she looked at the bay beneath her, making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves, and stony fields of the purpler spaces, again she was roused as usual by something incongruous. There was a brown spot in the middle of the bay. It was a boat. Yes, she realised that after a second. But whose boat? Mr. Ramsay's boat, she replied. Mr. Ramsay; the man who had marched past her, with his hand raised, aloof, at the head of a procession, in his beautiful boots, asking her for sympathy, which she had refused. The boat was now half way across the bay.",and now slowly the pain of the want  and the bitter anger  to be called back  just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for mrs  ramsay again  had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast  not in the least  lessened  and of their anguish left  as antidote  a relief that was balm in itself  and also  but more mysteriously  a sense of some one there  of mrs  ramsay  relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her  staying lightly by her side and then  for this was mrs  ramsay in all her beauty  raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went  lily squeezed her tubes again  she attacked that problem of the hedge  it was strange how clearly she saw her  stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds  purplish and soft  among whose flowers  hyacinth or lilies  she vanished  it was some trick of the painter own eye  for days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus  putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion  a shade across the fields  the sight  the phrase  had its power to console  wherever she happened to be  painting  here  in the country or in london  the vision would come to her  and her eyes  half closing  sought something to base her vision on  she looked down the railway carriage  the omnibus  took a line from shoulder or cheek  looked at the windows opposite  at piccadilly  lamp strung in the evening  all had been part of the fields of death  but always something    it might be a face  a voice  a paper boy crying standard  news    thrust through  snubbed her  waked her  required and got in the end an effort of attention  so that the vision must be perpetually remade  now again  moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue  she looked at the bay beneath her  making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves  and stony fields of the purpler spaces  again she was roused as usual by something incongruous  there was a brown spot in the middle of the bay  it was a boat  yes  she realised that after a second  but whose boat  mr  ramsay own boat  she replied  mr  ramsay  the man who had marched past her  with his hand raised  aloof  at the head of a procession  in his beautiful boots  asking her for sympathy  which she had refused  the boat was now half way across the bay ,2342,429,-3.2,-1.1495021797776364,-1.189655172413793,-1.1495021797776364,-0.3196233590970433,-2.2000000000000006,-0.8775025114236958,-0.8225806451612906,-0.8775025114236958,-0.2582011416776192,-169.88059015782983,-2.7490288514908428,-2.692640356133765,-2.7490288514908428,-0.7100164467084673,-7.016369047619048,-3.3532213525766603,-3.3078470824949697,-3.3532213525766603,-0.8730321486919729,8.016000000000002,1.1290792355461972,1.3872981700753502,1.1290792355461972,0.012243371669932378,43.57627986842269,1.4018453108937108,1.3687945606044825,1.4018453108937108,0.21633734833389826,-1.9468556404409556,-1.6260424194266798,-1.5239277390179655,-1.6260424194266798,-0.5532773731129267,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': -0.2411}",-0.2411,-0.7225973723773516,-0.5256445047489824,-0.7225973723773516,-0.34252225117894725,-0.018996415770609332,-0.6158641708968755,-0.5638350598028018,-0.6158641708968755,-0.3047904283441472,-0.09695583045093116,-0.8849440970861083,-0.6171263798799338,-0.8849440970861083,-0.4762983840458941,69.11337523565392,2.051578282678835,1.8078323925557944,2.051578282678835,-0.639565255102249,0.9362,1.5054465738403362,1.0554685752628048,1.5054465738403362,0.4452153207641133

432,432,37,"He had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart. Only now, as he grew older, and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage, it was not him, that old man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it was the thing that descended on him -  without his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak all cold and hard, that struck and struck at you (he could feel the beak on his bare legs, where it had struck when he was a child) and then made off, and there he was again, an old man, very sad, reading his book. That he would kill, that he would strike to the heart. Whatever he did -  (and he might do anything, he felt, looking at the Lighthouse and the distant shore) whether he was in a business, in a bank, a barrister, a man at the head of some enterprise, that he would fight, that he would track down and stamp out -  tyranny, despotism, he called it -  making people do what they did not want to do, cutting off their right to speak. How could any of them say, But I won't, when he said, Come to the Lighthouse. Do this. Fetch me that. The black wings spread, and the hard beak tore. And then next moment, there he sat reading his book; and he might look up -  one never knew -  quite reasonably. He might talk to the Macalisters. He might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman's hand in the street, James thought, and he might be shouting out at some fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement. Or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other. Yes, thought James, while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to feel, quite often lately, when his father said something or did something which surprised the others, there were two pairs of footprints only; his own and his father's. They alone knew each other. What then was this terror, this hatred? Turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him, peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in one's eyes, now with a dark shadow, he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape. Suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some one's knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently, some one's foot? Suppose he had seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole; then the wheel; and the same foot, purple, crushed. But the wheel was innocent. So now, when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the Lighthouse down it came over his foot, over Cam's foot, over anybody's foot. One sat and watched it.",he had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart  only now  as he grew older  and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage  it was not him  that old man reading  whom he wanted to kill  but it was the thing that descended on him    without his knowing it perhaps  that fierce sudden black winged harpy  with its talons and its beak all cold and hard  that struck and struck at you  he could feel the beak on his bare legs  where it had struck when he was a child  and then made off  and there he was again  an old man  very sad  reading his book  that he would kill  that he would strike to the heart  whatever he did     and he might do anything  he felt  looking at the lighthouse and the distant shore  whether he was in a business  in a bank  a barrister  a man at the head of some enterprise  that he would fight  that he would track down and stamp out    tyranny  despotism  he called it    making people do what they did not want to do  cutting off their right to speak  how could any of them say  but i will not  when he said  come to the lighthouse  do this  fetch me that  the black wings spread  and the hard beak tore  and then next moment  there he sat reading his book  and he might look up    one never knew    quite reasonably  he might talk to the macalisters  he might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman own hand in the street  james thought  and he might be shouting out at some fisherman own sports  he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement  or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other  yes  thought james  while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun  there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere  and there he had come to feel  quite often lately  when his father said something or did something which surprised the others  there were two pairs of footprints only  his own and his father own  they alone knew each other  what then was this terror  this hatred  turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him  peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted  and one blunders  now with the sun in one own eyes  now with a dark shadow  he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape  suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator  or on some one own knee  he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently  some one own foot  suppose he had seen the foot first  in the grass  smooth  and whole  then the wheel  and the same foot  purple  crushed  but the wheel was innocent  so now  when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the lighthouse down it came over his foot  over cam own foot  over anybody own foot  one sat and watched it ,2873,549,-6.700000000000002,-2.221761889587514,-2.3965517241379315,-2.221761889587514,-0.4682105115668534,-6.700000000000002,-2.2807601497091925,-2.2741935483870974,-2.2807601497091925,-0.4750557474819394,-300.73716139964404,-4.913343061370672,-4.766742431383485,-4.913343061370672,-0.9821926766274722,3.083333333333334,1.0913827839487986,1.2441314553990612,1.0913827839487986,0.0795362888050739,-14.428999999999993,-3.686100487030565,-3.444779332615713,-3.686100487030565,-1.1245409024633974,-12.258388690051339,-0.8173920682252183,-0.7097238183495586,-0.8173920682252183,-0.2792469695703257,-5.299782177694832,-3.9089983940869377,-3.825114329324452,-3.9089983940869377,-0.9671208370921536,"{'neg': 0.133, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.9952}",-0.9952,-1.8877934433476695,-1.2077792853912257,-1.8877934433476695,-0.4958421441754998,0.0926109765940274,0.002646719266230893,0.056206008889624536,0.002646719266230893,-0.15672536649157606,0.9555265674437696,2.065109804469526,2.0870723495519443,2.065109804469526,0.11685596995299755,84.32888700390895,2.788486352261908,2.392096143619302,2.788486352261908,-0.7377253495070079,-0.9999,-0.7428406879483737,-0.02711921270409304,-0.7428406879483737,0.18807286028754264

443,443,39,"It was like that then, the island, thought Cam, once more drawing her fingers through the waves. She had never seen it from out at sea before. It lay like that on the sea, did it, with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags, and the sea swept in there, and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island. It was very small; shaped something like a leaf stood on end. So we took a little boat, she thought, beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship. But with the sea streaming through her fingers, a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them, she did not want to tell herself seriously a story; it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted, for she was thinking, as the boat sailed on, how her father's anger about the points of the compass, James's obstinacy about the compact, and her own anguish, all had slipped, all had passed, all had streamed away. What then came next? Where were they going? From her hand, ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change, at the escape, at the adventure (that she should be alive, that she should be there). And the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark, the slumbrous shapes in her mind; shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness, catching here and there, a spark of light; Greece, Rome, Constantinople. Small as it was, and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold- sprinkled waters flowing in and about it, it had, she supposed, a place in the universe -  even that little island? The old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her. Sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it. There they were (it might be Mr. Carmichael or Mr. Bankes who was sitting with her father) sitting opposite each other in their low arm-chairs. They were crackling in front of them the pages of THE TIMES, when she came in from the garden, all in a muddle, about something some one had said about Christ, or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a London street, or wondering what Napoleon was like. Then they took all this with their clean hands (they wore grey-coloured clothes; they smelt of heather) and they brushed the scraps together, turning the paper, crossing their knees, and said something now and then very brief. Just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there, watching her father write, so equally, so neatly from one side of the page to another, with a little cough now and then, or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite. And she thought, standing there with her book open, one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water; and if it did well here, among the old gentlemen smoking and THE TIMES crackling then it was right. And watching her father as he wrote in his study, she thought (now sitting in the boat) he was not vain, nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him. Indeed, if he saw she was there, reading a book, he would ask her, as gently as any one could, Was there nothing he could give her?",it was like that then  the island  thought cam  once more drawing her fingers through the waves  she had never seen it from out at sea before  it lay like that on the sea  did it  with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags  and the sea swept in there  and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island  it was very small  shaped something like a leaf stood on end  so we took a little boat  she thought  beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship  but with the sea streaming through her fingers  a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them  she did not want to tell herself seriously a story  it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted  for she was thinking  as the boat sailed on  how her father own anger about the points of the compass  james own obstinacy about the compact  and her own anguish  all had slipped  all had passed  all had streamed away  what then came next  where were they going  from her hand  ice cold  held deep in the sea  there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change  at the escape  at the adventure  that she should be alive  that she should be there   and the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark  the slumbrous shapes in her mind  shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness  catching here and there  a spark of light  greece  rome  constantinople  small as it was  and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold  sprinkled waters flowing in and about it  it had  she supposed  a place in the universe    even that little island  the old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her  sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it  there they were  it might be mr  carmichael or mr  bankes who was sitting with her father  sitting opposite each other in their low arm chairs  they were crackling in front of them the pages of the times  when she came in from the garden  all in a muddle  about something some one had said about christ  or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a london street  or wondering what napoleon was like  then they took all this with their clean hands  they wore grey coloured clothes  they smelt of heather  and they brushed the scraps together  turning the paper  crossing their knees  and said something now and then very brief  just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there  watching her father write  so equally  so neatly from one side of the page to another  with a little cough now and then  or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite  and she thought  standing there with her book open  one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water  and if it did well here  among the old gentlemen smoking and the times crackling then it was right  and watching her father as he wrote in his study  she thought  now sitting in the boat  he was not vain  nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him  indeed  if he saw she was there  reading a book  he would ask her  as gently as any one could  was there nothing he could give her ,3153,588,5.649999999999999,1.5617830864559108,1.8620689655172409,1.5617830864559108,0.21487613263929045,5.649999999999999,1.5704024798076697,1.7096774193548383,1.5704024798076697,0.19345038953330915,13.546802001594598,0.2847852517246762,0.2147194434170387,0.2847852517246762,0.041308687568498384,5.4347666666666665,2.1261845955158094,2.3039323943661967,2.1261845955158094,0.2367638445620849,6.287000000000001,0.7581527155936364,1.015069967707212,0.7581527155936364,-0.18982353947638705,67.14762263421967,2.3387256809651844,2.2462685462165752,2.3387256809651844,0.2668146280789755,2.7769995247725747,1.5903577172988268,1.7181570606217471,1.5903577172988268,0.1959451008465541,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9922}",0.9922,1.1830335974246555,0.5899592944369062,1.1830335974246555,-0.06678214595817669,0.05491780045351475,-0.20624302749511603,-0.1532005252243347,-0.20624302749511603,-0.2090715367727796,0.4351732921399725,0.6065864001182063,0.7501011386823192,0.6065864001182063,-0.1848941820175816,91.17815106336623,3.120205589379506,2.655102526339343,3.120205589379506,-0.7186094535502222,-0.608,-0.2877486070150564,0.19201520912547526,-0.2877486070150564,0.23863933068249465
444,444,39,"Lest this should be wrong, she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover's egg. No; it was right. Look at him now, she wanted to say aloud to James. (But James had his eye on the sail.) He is a sarcastic brute, James would say. He brings the talk round to himself and his books, James would say. He is intolerably egotistical. Worst of all, he is a tyrant. But look! she said, looking at him. Look at him now. She looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled; the little book whose yellowish pages she knew, without knowing what was written on them. It was small; it was closely printed; on the fly-leaf, she knew, he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner; the wine had been so much; he had given so much to the waiter; all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page. But what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket, she did not know. What he thought they none of them knew. But he was absorbed in it, so that when he looked up, as he did now for an instant, it was not to see anything; it was to pin down some thought more exactly. That done, his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading. He read, she thought, as if he were guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing over page after page. And she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship, for she was safe, while he sat there; safe, as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden, and took a book down, and the old gentleman, lowering the paper suddenly, said something very brief over the top of it about the character of Napoleon.",lest this should be wrong  she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover own egg  no  it was right  look at him now  she wanted to say aloud to james   but james had his eye on the sail   he is a sarcastic brute  james would say  he brings the talk round to himself and his books  james would say  he is intolerably egotistical  worst of all  he is a tyrant  but look  she said  looking at him  look at him now  she looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled  the little book whose yellowish pages she knew  without knowing what was written on them  it was small  it was closely printed  on the fly leaf  she knew  he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner  the wine had been so much  he had given so much to the waiter  all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page  but what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket  she did not know  what he thought they none of them knew  but he was absorbed in it  so that when he looked up  as he did now for an instant  it was not to see anything  it was to pin down some thought more exactly  that done  his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading  he read  she thought  as if he were guiding something  or wheedling a large flock of sheep  or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path  and sometimes he went fast and straight  and broke his way through the bramble  and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him  a bramble blinded him  but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that  on he went  tossing over page after page  and she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship  for she was safe  while he sat there  safe  as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden  and took a book down  and the old gentleman  lowering the paper suddenly  said something very brief over the top of it about the character of napoleon ,1928,375,1.85,0.3976154015194727,0.5517241379310345,0.3976154015194727,0.06845883940620784,-0.1499999999999999,-0.23824069842696965,-0.16129032258064516,-0.23824069842696965,-0.11329417051350145,-28.850681790963407,-0.4164518032017741,-0.457288911111904,-0.4164518032017741,-0.13794525073578506,2.368750000000001,0.7769141076029131,0.9220657276995308,0.7769141076029131,0.10990178619034924,9.631000000000004,1.4755490618755125,1.7349838536060291,1.4755490618755125,0.18913676871591809,18.829737834837662,0.4182547836685844,0.4475722490849359,0.4182547836685844,0.010897015264219462,-0.8288787747560523,-0.8648292115949081,-0.7566358395378018,-0.8648292115949081,-0.3649561728199934,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.8462}",-0.8462,-1.6575663984271318,-1.0729986431478966,-1.6575663984271318,-0.5502422818559616,0.07046750992063491,-0.12006894493198307,-0.06681325040700044,-0.12006894493198307,-0.14336080924792838,0.41313682623632,0.5448193222596064,0.6934816805165325,0.5448193222596064,-0.07582211721652772,61.50280508689908,1.6829879491978157,1.5155924514635333,1.6829879491978157,-0.6015515928382045,-0.9988,-0.7415633179840291,-0.026504137776783718,-0.7415633179840291,0.13398302063334291

446,446,40,"So much depends then, thought Lily Briscoe, looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it, which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue, so much depends, she thought, upon distance: whether people are near us or far from us; for her feeling for Mr. Ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay. It seemed to be elongated, stretched out; he seemed to become more and more remote. He and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue, that distance; but here, on the lawn, close at hand, Mr. Carmichael suddenly grunted. She laughed. He clawed his book up from the grass. He settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster. That was different altogether, because he was so near. And now again all was quiet. They must be out of bed by this time, she supposed, looking at the house, but nothing appeared there. But then, she remembered, they had always made off directly a meal was over, on business of their own. It was all in keeping with this silence, this emptiness, and the unreality of the early morning hour. It was a way things had sometimes, she thought, lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke: they became illness, before habits had spun themselves across the surface, one felt that same unreality, which was so startling; felt something emerge. Life was most vivid then. One could be at one's ease. Mercifully one need not say, very briskly, crossing the lawn to greet old Mrs. Beckwith, who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in, ""Oh, good-morning, Mrs. Beckwith! What a lovely day! Are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun? Jasper's hidden the chairs. Do let me find you one!"" and all the rest of the usual chatter. One need not speak at all. One glided, one shook one's sails (there was a good deal of movement in the bay, boats were starting off) between things, beyond things. Empty it was not, but full to the brim. She seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance, to move and float and sink in it, yes, for these waters were unfathomably deep. Into them had spilled so many lives. The Ramsays'; the children's; and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides. A washer-woman with her basket; a rook, a red-hot poker; the purples and grey-greens of flowers: some common feeling which held the whole together.",so much depends then  thought lily briscoe  looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it  which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue  so much depends  she thought  upon distance  whether people are near us or far from us  for her feeling for mr  ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay  it seemed to be elongated  stretched out  he seemed to become more and more remote  he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue  that distance  but here  on the lawn  close at hand  mr  carmichael suddenly grunted  she laughed  he clawed his book up from the grass  he settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster  that was different altogether  because he was so near  and now again all was quiet  they must be out of bed by this time  she supposed  looking at the house  but nothing appeared there  but then  she remembered  they had always made off directly a meal was over  on business of their own  it was all in keeping with this silence  this emptiness  and the unreality of the early morning hour  it was a way things had sometimes  she thought  lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke  they became illness  before habits had spun themselves across the surface  one felt that same unreality  which was so startling  felt something emerge  life was most vivid then  one could be at one own ease  mercifully one need not say  very briskly  crossing the lawn to greet old mrs  beckwith  who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in   oh  good morning  mrs  beckwith  what a lovely day  are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun  jasper own hidden the chairs  do let me find you one   and all the rest of the usual chatter  one need not speak at all  one glided  one shook one own sails  there was a good deal of movement in the bay  boats were starting off  between things  beyond things  empty it was not  but full to the brim  she seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance  to move and float and sink in it  yes  for these waters were unfathomably deep  into them had spilled so many lives  the ramsays   the children own  and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides  a washer woman with her basket  a rook  a red hot poker  the purples and grey greens of flowers  some common feeling which held the whole together ,2388,437,5.15,1.408603127911643,1.6896551724137931,1.408603127911643,0.2830209655453544,5.15,1.414484964442615,1.5483870967741942,1.414484964442615,0.2601406687094228,14.088328189414394,0.2937418735603088,0.22330273869445771,0.2937418735603088,0.05780427559436595,6.623166666666667,2.6491670910998804,2.839549295774648,2.6491670910998804,0.4931291280372526,5.3560000000000025,0.5584230510037966,0.8146393972012923,0.5584230510037966,-0.15028261033366186,68.3311544424044,2.3857670281408927,2.2903270618109217,2.3857670281408927,0.4354727453596544,2.9041278275401634,1.6769174182427635,1.805407986738607,1.6769174182427635,0.3515037110758958,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.9864}",0.9864,1.1740717393002322,0.5847127996381728,1.1740717393002322,0.003064695787243298,0.1753401360544217,0.4611189134119219,0.5158124503362594,0.4611189134119219,0.004948736865906408,1.4066080846056137,3.3294680419894958,3.2460599658952463,3.3294680419894958,0.5627562961524555,72.2805148187774,2.2049671894633573,1.929448075364317,2.2049671894633573,-0.5833022126178272,-0.976,-0.7150869223594318,-0.013755312010735828,-0.7150869223594318,0.1616046721122324

450,450,40,"What was the problem then? She must try to get hold of something tht evaded her. It evaded her when she thought of Mrs. Ramsay; it evaded her now when she thought of her picture. Phrases came. Visions came. Beautiful pictures. Beautiful phrases. But what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves, the thing itself before it has been made anything. Get that and start afresh; get that and start afresh; she said desperately, pitching herself firmly again before her easel. It was a miserable machine, an inefficient machine, she thought, the human apparatus for painting or for feeling; it always broke down at the critical moment; heroically, one must force it on. She stared, frowning. There was the hedge, sure enough. But one got nothing by soliciting urgently.

451,451,40,"Here on the grass, on the ground, she thought, sitting down, and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains. For the lawn was very rough. Here sitting on the world, she thought, for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time, perhaps for the last time, as a traveller, even though he is half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now, for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in the fields, again. The lawn was the world; they were up here together, on this exalted station, she thought, looking at old Mr. Carmichael, who seemed (though they had not said a word all this time) to share her thoughts. And she would never see him again perhaps. He was growing old. Also, she remembered, smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot, he was growing famous. People said that his poetry was ""so beautiful."" They went and published things he had written forty years ago. There was a famous man now called Carmichael, she smiled, thinking how many shapes one person might wear, how he was that in the newspapers, but here the same as he had always been. He looked the same -  greyer, rather. Yes, he looked the same, but somebody had said, she recalled, that when he had heard of Andrew Ramsay's death (he was killed in a second by a shell; he should have been a great mathematician) Mr. Carmichael had ""lost all interest in life."" What did it mean -  that? she wondered. Had he marched through Trafalgar Square grasping a big stick? Had he turned pages over and over, without reading them, sitting in his room in St. John's Wood alone? She did not know what he had done, when he heard that Andrew was killed, but she felt it in him all the same. They only mumbled at each other on staircases; they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it won't be fine. But this was one way of knowing people, she thought: to know the outline, not the detail, to sit in one's garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather. She knew him in that way. She knew that he had changed somehow. She had never read a line of his poetry. She thought that she knew how it went though, slowly and sonorously. It was seasoned and mellow. It was about the desert and the camel. It was about the palm tree and the sunset. It was extremely impersonal; it said something about death; it said very little about love. There was an impersonality about him. He wanted very little of other people. Had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing-room window with some newspaper under his arm, trying to avoid Mrs. Ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like? On that account, of course, she would always try to make him stop. He would bow to her. He would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly. Annoyed that he did not want anything of her, Mrs. Ramsay would ask him (Lily could hear her) wouldn't he like a coat, a rug, a newspaper? No, he wanted nothing. (Here he bowed.) There was some quality in her which he did not much like. It was perhaps her masterfulness, her positiveness, something matter-of-fact in her. She was so direct.",here on the grass  on the ground  she thought  sitting down  and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains  for the lawn was very rough  here sitting on the world  she thought  for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time  perhaps for the last time  as a traveller  even though he is half asleep  knows  looking out of the train window  that he must look now  for he will never see that town  or that mule cart  or that woman at work in the fields  again  the lawn was the world  they were up here together  on this exalted station  she thought  looking at old mr  carmichael  who seemed  though they had not said a word all this time  to share her thoughts  and she would never see him again perhaps  he was growing old  also  she remembered  smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot  he was growing famous  people said that his poetry was  so beautiful   they went and published things he had written forty years ago  there was a famous man now called carmichael  she smiled  thinking how many shapes one person might wear  how he was that in the newspapers  but here the same as he had always been  he looked the same    greyer  rather  yes  he looked the same  but somebody had said  she recalled  that when he had heard of andrew ramsay own death  he was killed in a second by a she will  he should have been a great mathematician  mr  carmichael had  lost all interest in life   what did it mean    that  she wondered  had he marched through trafalgar square grasping a big stick  had he turned pages over and over  without reading them  sitting in his room in st  john own wood alone  she did not know what he had done  when he heard that andrew was killed  but she felt it in him all the same  they only mumbled at each other on staircases  they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it will not be fine  but this was one way of knowing people  she thought  to know the outline  not the detail  to sit in one own garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather  she knew him in that way  she knew that he had changed somehow  she had never read a line of his poetry  she thought that she knew how it went though  slowly and sonorously  it was seasoned and mellow  it was about the desert and the camel  it was about the palm tree and the sunset  it was extremely impersonal  it said something about death  it said very little about love  there was an impersonality about him  he wanted very little of other people  had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing room window with some newspaper under his arm  trying to avoid mrs  ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like  on that account  of course  she would always try to make him stop  he would bow to her  he would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly  annoyed that he did not want anything of her  mrs  ramsay would ask him  lily could hear her  would not he like a coat  a rug  a newspaper  no  he wanted nothing   here he bowed   there was some quality in her which he did not much like  it was perhaps her masterfulness  her positiveness  something matter of fact in her  she was so direct ,3201,592,5.349999999999997,1.4698751113293491,1.7586206896551713,1.4698751113293491,0.19697347904584728,5.349999999999997,1.476851970588636,1.6129032258064508,1.476851970588636,0.17592986867759308,67.5956137621792,1.1787305095779073,1.0714036097035875,1.1787305095779073,0.2047287095265393,6.21875,2.4711943230174795,2.657276995305164,2.4711943230174795,0.2914709230691634,11.878000000000005,1.9576033651336988,2.218729817007536,1.9576033651336988,0.047101385921679735,54.88832476107466,1.8514604605520963,1.7899001894183544,1.8514604605520963,0.18090131535190626,2.770539463290704,1.5859591610546484,1.713723379570443,1.5859591610546484,0.19248065288315952,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.9647}",-0.9647,-1.8406664307968212,-1.1801899592944367,-1.8406664307968212,-0.47338624877986896,0.099179012345679,0.03904575658183007,0.09269509639880004,0.03904575658183007,-0.15753058027070396,0.8254950769723195,1.7006382403296256,1.7529755589334952,1.7006382403296256,0.01247106416073695,91.73564000673665,3.1472055422782392,2.6765096657238763,3.1472055422782392,-0.7199973957750415,-0.9983,-0.7409826952729632,-0.026224558264370357,-0.7409826952729632,0.19674323233451046

She never talked of it -  she went, punctually, directly. It was her instinct to go, an instinct like the swallows for the south, the artichokes for the sun, turning her infallibly to the human race, making her nest in its heart. And this, like all instincts, was a little distressing to people who did not share it; to Mr. Carmichael perhaps, to herself certainly. Some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action, the supremacy of thought. Her going was a reproach to them, gave a different twist to the world, so that they were led to protest, seeing their own prepossessions disappear, and clutch at them vanishing. Charles Tansley did that too: it was part of the reason why one disliked him. He upset the proportions of one's world. And what had happened to him, she wondered, idly stirring the platains with her brush. He had got his fellowship. He had married; he lived at Golder's Green.",and then mrs  ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late  or the butter not fresh  or the teapot chipped  and all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of greek temples  and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room  she never talked of it    she went  punctually  directly  it was her instinct to go  an instinct like the swallows for the south  the artichokes for the sun  turning her infallibly to the human race  making her nest in its heart  and this  like all instincts  was a little distressing to people who did not share it  to mr  carmichael perhaps  to herself certainly  some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action  the supremacy of thought  her going was a reproach to them  gave a different twist to the world  so that they were led to protest  seeing their own prepossessions disappear  and clutch at them vanishing  charles tansley did that too  it was part of the reason why one disliked him  he upset the proportions of one own world  and what had happened to him  she wondered  idly stirring the platains with her brush  he had got his fellowship  he had married  he lived at golder own green ,1198,215,-1.7999999999999996,-0.7205982958536852,-0.7068965517241378,-0.7205982958536852,-0.3482110912343471,-0.8,-0.4409334684015414,-0.3709677419354839,-0.4409334684015414,-0.21507189131852647,-15.685589491977217,-0.19870655688608535,-0.2486196406346716,-0.19870655688608535,-0.13081101782886628,1.0770833333333334,0.2084867626045191,0.3399061032863849,0.2084867626045191,0.05323802024886375,-0.6709999999999977,-0.7345637250251701,-0.4828848223896658,-0.7345637250251701,-0.5390195561660892,13.007894536728857,0.186856396320672,0.2308465371406314,0.186856396320672,0.052050859883644975,-0.1826391144962731,-0.4248145924076913,-0.31310746998038,-0.4248145924076913,-0.2548605247801769,"{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': -0.7857}",-0.7857,-1.564084947301679,-1.0182722749886928,-1.564084947301679,-0.7215989407039993,0.0382936507936508,-0.29837149126867796,-0.2455569122235789,-0.29837149126867796,-0.1501764535154826,0.2951167226596843,0.21401505635008028,0.3902463819711526,0.21401505635008028,0.005901105803810916,38.90213138770617,0.5884063747747559,0.6477442585685279,0.5884063747747559,-0.37990439959425454,-0.9997,-0.7426084388639473,-0.027007380899127718,-0.7426084388639473,0.006407139666672373

And all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another, who had stood behind her smoking shag (""fivepence an ounce, Miss Briscoe"") and making it his business to tell her women can't write, women can't paint, not so much that he believed it, as that for some odd reason he wished it? There he was lean and red and raucous, preaching love from a platform (there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush -  red, energetic, shiny ants, rather like Charles Tansley). She had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half-empty hall, pumping love into that chilly space, and suddenly, there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and Mrs. Ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles. ""Oh, dear! What a nuisance! Lost again. Don't bother, Mr. Tansley. I lose thousands every summer,"" at which he pressed his chin back against his collar, as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration, but could stand it in her whom he liked, and smiled very charmingly. He must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone. He was educating his little sister, Mrs. Ramsay had told her. It was immensely to his credit. Her own idea of him was grotesque, Lily knew well, stirring the plantains with her brush. Half one's notions of other people were, after all, grotesque. They served private purposes of one's own. He did for her instead of a whipping-boy. She found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper.

Among them, must be one that was stone blind to her beauty.

What did the hedge mean to her, what did the garden mean to her, what did it mean to her when a wave broke? (Lily looked up, as she had seen Mrs. Ramsay look up; she too heard a wave falling on the beach.) And then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried, ""How's that?

459,459,40,"He stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair. It seemed somehow as if he had done it before; as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen. An old-fashioned scene that was, which required, very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers. Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs. Ramsay had thought (Lily supposed) the time has come now. Yes, she would say it now. Yes, she would marry him. And she stepped slowly, quietly on shore. Probably she said one word only, letting her hand rest still in his.

Still she would hold off, and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some Minta, Paul, or William Bankes at her side.

There it loomed up, stark and straight, glaring white and black, and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks. One could see lines and creases in the rocks. One could see the windows clearly; a dab of white on one of them, and a little tuft of green on the rock. A man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again. So it was like that, James thought, the Lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years; it was a stark tower on a bare rock. It satisfied him. It confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character. The old ladies, he thought, thinking of the garden at home, went dragging their chairs about on the lawn. Old Mrs. Beckwith, for example, was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy, but as a matter of fact, James thought, looking at the Lighthouse stood there on its rock, it's like that. He looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight. They shared that knowledge.

Still her father read, and James looked at him and she looked at him, and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death, and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought. It was thus that he escaped, she thought. Yes, with his great forehead and his great nose, holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him, he escaped. You might try to lay hands on him, but then like a bird, he spread his wings, he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump. She gazed at the immense expanse of the sea. The island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer. It looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover. Yet in its frailty were all those paths, those terraces, those bedrooms -   all those innumberable things. But as, just before sleep, things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself, so, she felt, looking drowsily at the island, all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing, and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind.
