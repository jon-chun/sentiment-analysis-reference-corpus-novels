,sent_clean
0,yes of course if it is fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay
1,but you will have to be up with the lark she added
2,to her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy as if it were settled the expedition were bound to take place and the wonder to which he had looked forward for years and years it seemed was after a night own darkness and a day own sail within touch
3,since he belonged even at the age of six to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that but must let future prospects with their joys and sorrows cloud what is actually at hand since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests james ramsay sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the army and navy stores endowed the picture of a refrigerator as his mother spoke with heavenly bliss
4,it was fringed with joy
5,the wheelbarrow the lawnmower the sound of poplar trees leaves whitening before rain rooks cawing brooms knocking dresses rustling   ”all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code his secret language though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes impeccably candid and pure frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty so that his mother watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator imagined him all red and ermine on the bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs
6,but said his father stopping in front of the drawing room window it will not be fine
7,had there been an axe handy a poker or any weapon that would have gashed a hole in his father own breast and killed him there and then james would have seized it
8,such were the extremes of emotion that mr ramsay excited in his children own breasts by his mere presence standing as now lean as a knife narrow as the blade of one grinning sarcastically not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was james thought but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement
9,what he said was true
10,it was always true
11,he was incapable of untruth never tampered with a fact never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being least of all of his own children who sprung from his loins should be aware from childhood that life is difficult facts uncompromising and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished our frail barks founder in darkness here mr ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon one that needs above all courage truth and the power to endure
12,but it may be fine   ”i expect it will be fine said mrs ramsay making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting impatiently
13,if she finished it tonight if they did go to the lighthouse after all it was to be given to the lighthouse keeper for his little boy who was threatened with a tuberculous hip together with a pile of old magazines and some tobacco indeed whatever she could find lying about not really wanted but only littering the room to give those poor fellows who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden something to amuse them
14,for how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time and possibly more in stormy weather upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn
15,she would ask and to have no letters or newspapers and to see nobody if you were married not to see your wife not to know how your children were   ”if they were ill if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week and then a dreadful storm coming and the windows covered with spray and birds dashed against the lamp and the whole place rocking and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea
16,how would you like that
17,she asked addressing herself particularly to her daughters
18,so she added rather differently one must take them whatever comforts one can
19,it is due west said the atheist tansley holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them for he was sharing mr ramsay own evening walk up and down up and down the terrace
20,that is to say the wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the lighthouse
21,yes he did say disagreeable things mrs ramsay admitted it was odious of him to rub this in and make james still more disappointed but at the same time she would not let them laugh at him
22,the atheist they called him the little atheist
23,rose mocked him prue mocked him andrew jasper roger mocked him even old badger without a tooth in his head had bit him for being as nancy put it the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone
24,nonsense said mrs ramsay with great severity
25,apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her and from the implication which was true that she asked too many people to stay and had to lodge some in the town she could not bear incivility to her guests to young men in particular who were poor as churchmice exceptionally able her husband said his great admirers and come there for a holiday
26,indeed she had the whole of the other sex under her protection for reasons she could not explain for their chivalry and valour for the fact that they negotiated treaties ruled india controlled finance finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable something trustful childlike reverential which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity and woe betide the girl   ”pray heaven it was none of her daughters
27,  ”who did not feel the worth of it and all that it implied to the marrow of her bones
28,she turned with severity upon nancy
29,he had not chased them she said
30,he had been asked
31,they must find a way out of it all
32,there might be some simpler way some less laborious way she sighed
33,when she looked in the glass and saw her hair grey her cheek sunk at fifty she thought possibly she might have managed things better   ”her husband money his books
34,but for her own part she would never for a single second regret her decision evade difficulties or slur over duties
35,she was now formidable to behold and it was only in silence looking up from their plates after she had spoken so severely about charles tansley that her daughters prue nancy rose   ”could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers in paris perhaps a wilder life not always taking care of some man or other for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry of the bank of england and the indian empire of ringed fingers and lace though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts and made them as they sat at table beneath their mother own eyes honour her strange severity her extreme courtesy like a queen own raising from the mud to wash a beggar own dirty foot when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them   ”or speaking accurately been invited to stay with them   ”in the isle of skye
36,there will be no landing at the lighthouse tomorrow said charles tansley clapping his hands together as he stood at the window with her husband
37,surely he had said enough
38,she wished they would both leave her and james alone and go on talking
39,she looked at him
40,he was such a miserable specimen the children said all humps and hollows
41,he could not play cricket he poked he shuffled
42,he was a sarcastic brute andrew said
43,they knew what he liked best   ”to be for ever walking up and down up and down with mr ramsay and saying who had won this who had won that who was a first rate man at latin verses who was brilliant but i think fundamentally unsound who was undoubtedly the ablest fellow in balliol who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford but was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena of which mr tansley had the first pages in proof with him if mr ramsay would like to see them to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day
44,that was what they talked about
45,she could not help laughing herself sometimes
46,she said the other day something about waves mountains high
47,yes said charles tansley it was a little rough
48,are not you drenched to the skin she had said
49,damp not wet through said mr tansley pinching his sleeve feeling his socks
50,but it was not that they minded the children said
51,it was not his face it was not his manners
52,it was him   ”his point of view
53,when they talked about something interesting people music history anything even said it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors then what they complained of about charles tansley was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them   ”he was not satisfied
54,and he would go to picture galleries they said and he would ask one did one like his tie
55,god knows said rose one did not
56,disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner table directly the meal was over the eight sons and daughters of mr and mrs ramsay sought their bedrooms their fastness in a house where there was no other privacy to debate anything everything tansley own tie the passing of the reform bill sea birds and butterflies people while the sun poured into those attics which a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep could be plainly heard and the swiss girl sobbing for her father who was dying of cancer in a valley of the grisons and lit up bats flannels straw hats ink pots paint pots beetles and the skulls of small birds while it drew from the long frilled strips of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds which was in the towels too gritty with sand from bathing
57,strife divisions difference of opinion prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being oh that they should begin so early mrs ramsay deplored
58,they were so critical her children
59,they talked such nonsense
60,she went from the dining room holding james by the hand since he would not go with the others
61,it seemed to her such nonsense   ”inventing differences when people heaven knows were different enough without that
62,the real differences she thought standing by the drawing room window are enough quite enough
63,she had in mind at the moment rich and poor high and low the great in birth receiving from her half grudging some respect for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble if slightly mythical italian house whose daughters scattered about english drawing rooms in the nineteenth century had lisped so charmingly had stormed so wildly and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them and not from the sluggish english or the cold scotch but more profoundly she ruminated the other problem of rich and poor and the things she saw with her own eyes weekly daily here or in london when she visited this widow or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm and a note book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings employment and unemployment in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation half a relief to her own curiosity and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired an investigator elucidating the social problem
64,insoluble questions they were it seemed to her standing there holding james by the hand
65,he had followed her into the drawing room that young man they laughed at he was standing by the table fidgeting with something awkwardly feeling himself out of things as she knew without looking round
66,they had all gone   ”the children minta doyle and paul rayley augustus carmichael her husband   ”they had all gone
67,so she turned with a sigh and said would it bore you to come with me mr tansley
68,she had a dull errand in the town she had a letter or two to write she would be ten minutes perhaps she would put on her hat
69,and with her basket and her parasol there she was again ten minutes later giving out a sense of being ready of being equipped for a jaunt which however she must interrupt for a moment as they passed the tennis lawn to ask mr carmichael who was basking with his yellow cat own eyes ajar so that like a cat own they seemed to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing but to give no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever if he wanted anything
70,for they were making the great expedition she said laughing
71,they were going to the town
72,stamps writing paper tobacco she suggested stopping by his side
73,but no he wanted nothing
74,his hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch his eyes blinked as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments she was seductive but a little nervous but could not sunk as he was in a grey green somnolence which embraced them all without need of words in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well wishing all the house all the world all the people in it for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something which accounted the children thought for the vivid streak of canary yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white
75,no nothing he murmured
76,he should have been a great philosopher said mrs ramsay as they went down the road to the fishing village but he had made an unfortunate marriage
77,holding her black parasol very erect and moving with an indescribable air of expectation as if she were going to meet some one round the corner she told the story an affair at oxford with some girl an early marriage poverty going to india translating a little poetry very beautifully i believe being willing to teach the boys persian or hindustanee but what really was the use of that
78,  ”and then lying as they saw him on the lawn
79,it flattered him snubbed as he had been it soothed him that mrs ramsay should tell him this
80,charles tansley revived
81,insinuating too as she did the greatness of man own intellect even in its decay the subjection of all wives   ”not that she blamed the girl and the marriage had been happy enough she believed   ”to their husband own labours she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet and he would have liked had they taken a cab for example to have paid the fare
82,as for her little bag might he not carry that
83,no no she said she always carried that herself
84,she did too
85,yes he felt that in her
86,he felt many things something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give
87,he would like her to see him gowned and hooded walking in a procession
88,a fellowship a professorship he felt capable of anything and saw himself   ”but what was she looking at
89,at a man pasting a bill
90,the vast flapping sheet flattened itself out and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs hoops horses glistening reds and blues beautifully smooth until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus a hundred horsemen twenty performing seals lions tigerscraning forwards for she was short sighted she read it outwill visit this town she read
91,it was terribly dangerous work for a one armed man she exclaimed to stand on top of a ladder like that   ”his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago
92,let us all go she cried moving on as if all those riders and horses had filled her with childlike exultation and made her forget her pity
93,let us go he said repeating her words clicking them out however with a self consciousness that made her wince
94,let us all go to the circus
95,no
96,he could not say it right
97,he could not feel it right
98,but why not
99,she wondered
100,what was wrong with him then
101,she liked him warmly at the moment
102,had they not been taken she asked to circuses when they were children
103,never he answered as if she asked the very thing he wanted had been longing all these days to say how they did not go to circuses
104,it was a large family nine brothers and sisters and his father was a working man
105,my father is a chemist mrs ramsay he keeps a shop
106,he himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen
107,often he went without a greatcoat in winter
108,he could never return hospitality those were his parched stiff words at college
109,he had to make things last twice the time other people did he smoked the cheapest tobacco shag the same the old men did in the quays
110,he worked hard   ”seven hours a day his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody   ”they were walking on and mrs ramsay did not quite catch the meaning only the words here and theredissertationfellowshipreadershiplectureship
111,she could not follow the ugly academic jargon that rattled itself off so glibly but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch poor little man and why he came out instantly with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters and she would see to it that they did not laugh at him any more she would tell prue about it
112,what he would have liked she supposed would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with the ramsays
113,he was an awful prig   ”oh yes an insufferable bore
114,for though they had reached the town now and were in the main street with carts grinding past on the cobbles still he went on talking about settlements and teaching and working men and helping our own class and lectures till she gathered that he had got back entire self confidence had recovered from the circus and was about and now again she liked him warmly to tell her   ”but here the houses falling away on both sides they came out on the quay and the whole bay spread before them and mrs ramsay could not help exclaiming oh how beautiful
115,for the great plateful of blue water was before her the hoary lighthouse distant austere in the midst and on the right as far as the eye could see fading and falling in soft low pleats the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them which always seemed to be running away into some moon country uninhabited of men
116,that was the view she said stopping growing greyer eyed that her husband loved
117,she paused a moment
118,but now she said artists had come here
119,there indeed only a few paces off stood one of them in panama hat and yellow boots seriously softly absorbedly for all that he was watched by ten little boys with an air of profound contentment on his round red face gazing and then when he had gazed dipping imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink
120,since mr paunceforte had been there three years before all the pictures were like that she said green and grey with lemon coloured sailing boats and pink women on the beach
121,but her grandmother own friends she said glancing discreetly as they passed took the greatest pains first they mixed their own colours and then they ground them and then they put damp cloths to keep them moist
122,so mr tansley supposed she meant him to see that that man own picture was skimpy was that what one said
123,the colours were not solid
124,was that what one said
125,under the influence of that extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk had begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag had increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything about himself he was coming to see himself and everything he had ever known gone crooked a little
126,it was awfully strange
127,there he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him waiting for her while she went upstairs a moment to see a woman
128,he heard her quick step above heard her voice cheerful then low looked at the mats tea caddies glass shades waited quite impatiently looked forward eagerly to the walk home determined to carry her bag then heard her come out shut a door say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut ask at the house for anything they wanted she must be talking to a child when suddenly in she came stood for a moment silent as if she had been pretending up there and for a moment let herself be now stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of queen victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the garter when all at once he realised that it was this it was this   ”she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen
129,with stars in her eyes and veils in her hair with cyclamen and wild violets   ”what nonsense was he thinking
130,she was fifty at least she had eight children
131,stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair   ”he had hold of her bag
132,good bye elsie she said and they walked up the street she holding her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner while for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked at her let his arm fall down and looked at her for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride felt the wind and the cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman
133,he had hold of her bag
134,no going to the lighthouse james he said as trying in deference to mrs ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least
135,odious little man thought mrs ramsay why go on saying that
136,perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing she said compassionately smoothing the little boy own hair for her husband with his caustic saying that it would not be fine had dashed his spirits she could see
137,this going to the lighthouse was a passion of his she saw and then as if her husband had not said enough with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again
138,perhaps it will be fine tomorrow she said smoothing his hair
139,all she could do now was to admire the refrigerator and turn the pages of the stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake or a mowing machine which with its prongs and its handles would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out
140,all these young men parodied her husband she reflected he said it would rain they said it would be a positive tornado
141,but here as she turned the page suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing machine was interrupted
142,the gruff murmur irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her though she could not hear what was said as she sat in the window which opened on the terrace that the men were happily talking this sound which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her such as the tap of balls upon bats the sharp sudden bark now and then how is that how is that of the children playing cricket had ceased so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song murmured by nature i am guarding you   ”i am your support but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand had no such kindly meaning but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as a rainbow   ”this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror
143,they had ceased to talk that was the explanation
144,falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion was cool amused and even faintly malicious she concluded that poor charles tansley had been she would
145,that was of little account to her
146,if her husband required sacrifices and indeed he did she cheerfully offered up to him charles tansley who had snubbed her little boy
147,one moment more with her head raised she listened as if she waited for some habitual sound some regular mechanical sound and then hearing something rhythmical half said half chanted beginning in the garden as her husband beat up and down the terrace something between a croak and a song she was soothed once more assured again that all was well and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if james was very careful
148,suddenly a loud cry as of a sleep walker half roused something about
149,stormed at with shot and she will
150,sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him
151,only lily briscoe she was glad to find and that did not matter
152,but the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily own picture
153,lily own picture
154,mrs ramsay smiled
155,with her little chinese eyes and her puckered up face she would never marry one could not take her painting very seriously she was an independent little creature and mrs ramsay liked her for it so remembering her promise she bent her head
156,indeed he almost knocked her easel over coming down upon her with his hands waving shouting out boldly we rode and well but mercifully he turned sharp and rode off to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of balaclava
157,never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so alarming
158,but so long as he kept like that waving shouting she was safe he would not stand still and look at her picture
159,and that was what lily briscoe could not have endured
160,even while she looked at the mass at the line at the colour at mrs ramsay sitting in the window with james she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up and suddenly she should find her picture looked at
161,but now with all her senses quickened as they were looking straining till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes she was aware of someone coming out of the house coming towards her but somehow divined from the footfall william bankes so that though her brush quivered she did not as she would have done had it been mr tansley paul rayley minta doyle or practically anybody else turn her canvas upon the grass but let it stand
162,william bankes stood beside her
163,they had rooms in the village and so walking in walking out parting late on door mats had said little things about the soup about the children about one thing and another which made them allies so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way he was old enough to be her father too a botanist a widower smelling of soap very scrupulous and clean she just stood there
164,he just stood there
165,her shoes were excellent he observed
166,they allowed the toes their natural expansion
167,lodging in the same house with her he had noticed too how orderly she was up before breakfast and off to paint he believed alone poor presumably and without the complexion or the allurement of miss doyle certainly but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady
168,now for instance when ramsay bore down on them shouting gesticulating miss briscoe he felt certain understood
169,some one had blundered
170,mr ramsay glared at them
171,he glared at them without seeming to see them
172,that did make them both vaguely uncomfortable
173,together they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see
174,they had encroached upon a privacy
175,so lily thought it was probably an excuse of his for moving for getting out of earshot that made mr bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll
176,she would come yes
177,but it was with difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture
178,the jacmanna was bright violet the wall staring white
179,she would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white since she saw them like that fashionable though it was since mr paunceforte own visit to see everything pale elegant semitransparent
180,then beneath the colour there was the shape
181,she could see it all so clearly so commandingly when she looked it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed
182,it was in that moment own flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child
183,such she often felt herself   ”struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage to say but this is what i see this is what i see and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her
184,and it was then too in that chill and windy way as she began to paint that there forced themselves upon her other things her own inadequacy her insignificance keeping house for her father off the brompton road and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself thank heaven she had always resisted so far at mrs ramsay own knee and say to her   ”but what could one say to her
185,I am in love with you
186,no that was not true
187,I am in love with this all waving her hand at the hedge at the house at the children
188,it was absurd it was impossible
189,so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box side by side and said to william bankes
190,it suddenly gets cold the sun seems to give less heat she said looking about her for it was bright enough the grass still a soft deep green the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue
191,but something moved flashed turned a silver wing in the air
192,it was september after all the middle of september and past six in the evening
193,so off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction past the tennis lawn past the pampas grass to that break in the thick hedge guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever
194,they came there regularly every evening drawn by some need
195,it was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief
196,first the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue and the heart expanded with it and the body swam only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves
197,then up behind the great black rock almost every evening spurted irregularly so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came a fountain of white water and then while one waited for that one watched on the pale semicircular beach wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly a film of mother of pearl
198,they both smiled standing there
199,they both felt a common hilarity excited by the moving waves and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat which having sliced a curve in the bay stopped shivered let its sails drop down and then with a natural instinct to complete the picture after this swift movement both of them looked at the dunes far away and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness   ”because the thing was completed partly and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years lily thought the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest
200,looking at the far sand hills william bankes thought of ramsay thought of a road in westmorland thought of ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air
201,but this was suddenly interrupted william bankes remembered and this must refer to some actual incident by a hen straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks upon which ramsay stopping pointed his stick and said pretty   ”pretty an odd illumination in to his heart bankes had thought it which showed his simplicity his sympathy with humble things but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased there on that stretch of road
202,after that ramsay had married
203,after that what with one thing and another the pulp had gone out of their friendship
204,whose fault it was he could not say only after a time repetition had taken the place of newness
205,it was to repeat that they met
206,but in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for ramsay had in no way diminished but there like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century with the red fresh on his lips was his friendship in its acuteness and reality laid up across the bay among the sandhills
207,he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk   ”for ramsay lived in a welter of children whereas bankes was childless and a widower   ”he was anxious that lily briscoe should not disparage ramsay a great man in his own way yet should understand how things stood between them
208,begun long years ago their friendship had petered out on a westmorland road where the hen spread her wings before her chicks after which ramsay had married and their paths lying different ways there had been certainly for no one own fault some tendency when they met to repeat
209,yes
210,that was it
211,he finished
212,he turned from the view
213,and turning to walk back the other way up the drive mr bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat   ”for instance cam the little girl ramsay own youngest daughter
214,she was picking sweet alice on the bank
215,she was wild and fierce
216,she would not give a flower to the gentleman as the nursemaid told her
217,no no no she would not
218,she clenched her fist
219,she stamped
220,and mr bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship
221,he must have dried and shrunk
222,the ramsays were not rich and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all
223,eight children
224,to feed eight children on philosophy
225,here was another of them jasper this time strolling past to have a shot at a bird he said nonchalantly swinging lily own hand like a pump handle as he passed which caused mr bankes to say bitterly how she was a favourite
226,there was education now to be considered true mrs ramsay had something of her own perhaps let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those great fellows all well grown angular ruthless youngsters must require
227,as for being sure which was which or in what order they came that was beyond him
228,he called them privately after the kings and queens of england cam the wicked james the ruthless andrew the just prue the fair   ”for prue would have beauty he thought how could she help it
229,  ”and andrew brains
230,while he walked up the drive and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments for she was in love with them all in love with this world he weighed ramsay own case commiserated him envied him as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities
231,they gave him something   ”william bankes acknowledged that it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder as over her father own to look at a picture of vesuvius in eruption but they had also his old friends could not but feel destroyed something
232,what would a stranger think now
233,what did this lily briscoe think
234,could one help noticing that habits grew on him
235,eccentricities weaknesses perhaps
236,it was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did   ”but that was too harsh a phrase   ”could depend so much as he did upon people own praise
237,oh but said lily think of his work
238,whenever she thought of his work she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table
239,it was andrew own doing
240,she asked him what his father own books were about
241,subject and object and the nature of reality andrew had said
242,and when she said heavens she had no notion what that meant
243,think of a kitchen table then he told her when you are not there
244,so now she always saw when she thought of mr ramsay own work a scrubbed kitchen table
245,it lodged now in the fork of a pear tree for they had reached the orchard
246,and with a painful effort of concentration she focused her mind not upon the silver bossed bark of the tree or upon its fish shaped leaves but upon a phantom kitchen table one of those scrubbed board tables grained and knotted whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity which stuck there its four legs in air
247,naturally if one own days were passed in this seeing of angular essences this reducing of lovely evenings with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four legged table and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person
248,mr bankes liked her for bidding him think of his work
249,he had thought of it often and often
250,times without number he had said ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty
251,he had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only five and twenty what came after was more or less amplification repetition
252,but the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small he said pausing by the pear tree well brushed scrupulously exact exquisitely judicial
253,suddenly as if the movement of his hand had released it the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him
254,that was one sensation
255,then up rose in a fume the essence of his being
256,that was another
257,she felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception it was his severity his goodness
258,i respect you she addressed silently him in person in every atom you are not vain you are entirely impersonal you are finer than mr ramsay you are the finest human being that i know you have neither wife nor child without any sexual feeling she longed to cherish that loneliness you live for science involuntarily sections of potatoes rose before her eyes praise would be an insult to you generous pure hearted heroic man
259,but simultaneously she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here objected to dogs on chairs would prose for hours until mr ramsay slammed out of the room about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of english cooks
260,how then did it work out all this
261,how did one judge people think of them
262,how did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking
263,and to those words what meaning attached after all
264,standing now apparently transfixed by the pear tree impressions poured in upon her of those two men and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one own pencil and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable everlasting contradictory things so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity
265,you have greatness she continued but mr ramsay has none of it
266,he is petty selfish vain egotistical he is spoilt he is a tyrant he wears mrs ramsay to death but he has what you she addressed mr bankes have not a fiery unworldliness he knows nothing about trifles he loves dogs and his children
267,he has eight
268,mr bankes has none
269,did he not come down in two coats the other night and let mrs ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin
270,all of this danced up and down like a company of gnats each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net   ”danced up and down in lily own mind in and about the branches of the pear tree where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table symbol of her profound respect for mr ramsay own mind until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity she felt released a shot went off close at hand and there came flying from its fragments frightened effusive tumultuous a flock of starlings
271,jasper said mr bankes
272,they turned the way the starlings flew over the terrace
273,following the scatter of swift flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into mr ramsay who boomed tragically at them some one had blundered
274,his eyes glazed with emotion defiant with tragic intensity met theirs for a second and trembled on the verge of recognition but then raising his hand half way to his face as if to avert to brush off in an agony of peevish shame their normal gaze as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable as if he impressed upon them his own child like resentment of interruption yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed but in which he revelled   ”he turned abruptly slammed his private door on them and lily briscoe and mr bankes looking uneasily up into the sky observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees
275,and even if it is not fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay raising her eyes to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed it will be another day and now she said thinking that lily own charm was her chinese eyes aslant in her white puckered little face but it would take a clever man to see it and now stand up and let me measure your leg for they might go to the lighthouse after all and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg
276,smiling for it was an admirable idea that had flashed upon her this very second   ”william and lily should marry   ”she took the heather mixture stocking with its criss cross of steel needles at the mouth of it and measured it against james own leg
277,my dear stand still she said for in his jealousy not liking to serve as measuring block for the lighthouse keeper own little boy james fidgeted purposely and if he did that how could she see was it too long was it too short
278,she asked
279,she looked up   ”what demon possessed him her youngest her cherished
280,  ”and saw the room saw the chairs thought them fearfully shabby
281,their entrails as andrew said the other day were all over the floor but then what was the point she asked of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house with only one old woman to see to it positively dripped with wet
282,never mind the rent was precisely twopence half penny the children loved it it did her husband good to be three thousand or if she must be accurate three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples and there was room for visitors
283,mats camp beds crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose london life of service was done   ”they did well enough here and a photograph or two and books
284,books she thought grew of themselves
285,she never had time to read them
286,alas even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself for her whose wishes must be obeyedthe happier helen of our daysdisgraceful to say she had never read them
287,and croom on the mind and bates on the savage customs of polynesia my dear stand still she said   ”neither of those could one send to the lighthouse
288,at a certain moment she supposed the house would become so shabby that something must be done
289,if they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them   ”that would be something
290,crabs she had to allow if andrew really wished to dissect them or if jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed one could not prevent it or rose own objects   ”shells reeds stones for they were gifted her children but all in quite different ways
291,and the result of it was she sighed taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling as she held the stocking against james own leg that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer
292,the mat was fading the wall paper was flapping
293,you could not tell any more that those were roses on it
294,still if every door in a house is left perpetually open and no lockmaker in the whole of scotland can mend a bolt things must spoil
295,what was the use of flinging a green cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame
296,in two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup
297,but it was the doors that annoyed her every door was left open
298,she listened
299,the drawing room door was open the hall door was open it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open and certainly the window on the landing was open for that she had opened herself
300,that windows should be open and doors shut   ”simple as it was could none of them remember it
301,she would go into the maids bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens except for marie own the swiss girl who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air but then at home she had said the mountains are so beautiful
302,she had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes
303,the mountains are so beautiful
304,her father was dying there mrs ramsay knew
305,he was leaving them fatherless
306,scolding and demonstrating how to make a bed how to open a window with hands that shut and spread like a frenchwoman own all had folded itself quietly about her when the girl spoke as after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple
307,she had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said
308,he had cancer of the throat
309,at the recolection   ”how she had stood there how the girl had said at home the mountains are so beautiful and there was no hope no hope whatever she had a spasm of irritation and speaking sharply said to james
310,stand still do not be tiresome so that he knew instantly that her severity was real and straightened his leg and she measured it
311,the stocking was too short by half an inch at least making allowance for the fact that sorley own little boy would be less well grown than james
312,it is too short she said ever so much too short
313,never did anybody look so sad
314,bitter and black half way down in the darkness in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths perhaps a tear formed a tear fell the waters swayed this way and that received it and were at rest
315,never did anybody look so sad
316,but was it nothing but looks people said
317,what was there behind it   ”her beauty and splendour
318,had he blown his brains out they asked had he died the week before they were married   ”some other earlier lover of whom rumours reached one
319,or was there nothing
320,nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind and could do nothing to disturb
321,for easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion of love foiled of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself she never spoke
322,she was silent always
323,she knew then   ”she knew without having learnt
324,her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified
325,her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone alight exact as a bird gave her naturally this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted eased sustained   ”falsely perhaps
326,nature has but little clay said mr bankes once much moved by her voice on the telephone though she was only telling him a fact about a train like that of which she moulded you
327,he saw her at the end of the line greek blue eyed straight nosed
328,how incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that
329,the graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face
330,yes he would catch the  at euston
331,but she is no more aware of her beauty than a child said mr bankes replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house
332,and he thought of mrs ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls
333,for always he thought there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face
334,she clapped a deer stalker own hat on her head she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief
335,so that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of one must remember the quivering thing the living thing they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them and work it into the picture or if one thought of her simply as a woman one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy   ”she did not like admiration   ”or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty and she wanted only to be like other people insignificant
336,he did not know
337,he did not know
338,he must go to his work
339,knitting her reddish brown hairy stocking with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame and the authenticated masterpiece by michael angelo mrs ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before raised his head and kissed her little boy on the forehead
340,let us find another picture to cut out she said
341,but what had happened
342,some one had blundered
343,starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time
344,some one had blundered   ”fixing her short sighted eyes upon her husband who was now bearing down upon her she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her the jingle mated itself in her head that something had happened some one had blundered
345,but she could not for the life of her think what
346,he shivered he quivered
347,all his vanity all his satisfaction in his own splendour riding fell as a thunderbolt fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death had been shattered destroyed
348,stormed at by shot and she will boldly we rode and well flashed through the valley of death volleyed and thundered   ”straight into lily briscoe and william bankes
349,he quivered he shivered
350,not for the world would she have spoken to him realising from the familiar signs his eyes averted and some curious gathering together of his person as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium that he was outraged and anguished
351,she stroked james own head she transferred to him what she felt for her husband and as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the army and navy stores catalogue thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist and why should he not
352,he had a splendid forehead
353,then looking up as her husband passed her once more she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled domesticity triumphed custom crooned its soothing rhythm so that when stopping deliberately as his turn came round again at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle james own bare calf with a sprig of something she twitted him for having dispatched that poor young man charles tansley
354,tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation he said
355,james will have to write his dissertation one of these days he added ironically flicking his sprig
356,hating his father james brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him compound of severity and humour he teased his youngest son own bare leg
357,she was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to sorley own little boy tomorrow said mrs ramsay
358,there was not the slightest possible chance that they could go to the lighthouse tomorrow mr ramsay snapped out irascibly
359,how did he know
360,she asked
361,the wind often changed
362,the extraordinary irrationality of her remark the folly of women own minds enraged him
363,he had ridden through the valley of death been shattered and shivered and now she flew in the face of facts made his children hope what was utterly out of the question in effect told lies
364,he stamped his foot on the stone step
365,damn you he said
366,but what had she said
367,simply that it might be fine tomorrow
368,so it might
369,not with the barometer falling and the wind due west
370,to pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people own feelings to rendthe thin veils of civilization so wantonly so brutally was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that without replying dazed and blinded she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail the drench of dirty water bespatter her unrebuked
371,there was nothing to be said
372,he stood by her in silence
373,very humbly at length he said that he would step over and ask the coastguards if she liked
374,there was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him
375,she was quite ready to take his word for it she said
376,only then they need not cut sandwiches   ”that was all
377,they came to her naturally since she was a woman all day long with this and that one wanting this another that the children were growing up she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions
378,then he said damn you
379,he said it must rain
380,he said it will not rain and instantly a heaven of security opened before her
381,there was nobody she reverenced more
382,she was not good enough to tie his shoe strings she felt
383,already ashamed of that petulance of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops mr ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son own bare legs once more and then as if he had her leave for it with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side he dived into the evening air which already thinner was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but as if in return restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day
384,some one had blundered he said again striding off up and down the terrace
385,but how extraordinarily his note had changed
386,it was like the cuckoo in june he gets out of tune as if he were trying over tentatively seeking some phrase for a new mood and having only this at hand used it cracked though it was
387,but it sounded ridiculous   ”some one had blundered   ”said like that almost as a question without any conviction melodiously
388,mrs ramsay could not help smiling and soon sure enough walking up and down he hummed it dropped it fell silent
389,he was safe he was restored to his privacy
390,he stopped to light his pipe looked once at his wife and son in the window and as one raises one own eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm a tree a cluster of cottages as an illustration a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns fortified and satisfied so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind
391,it was a splendid mind
392,for if thought is like the keyboard of a piano divided into so many notes or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty six letters all in order then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one firmly and accurately until it had reached say the letter q he reached q very few people in the whole of england ever reach q here stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums he saw but now far far away like children picking up shells divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived his wife and son together in the window
393,they needed his protection he gave it them
394,but after q
395,what comes next
396,after q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes but glimmers red in the distance
397,z is only reached once by one man in a generation
398,still if he could reach r it would be something
399,here at least was q he dug his heels in at q q he was sure of
400,q he could demonstrate
401,if q then is q   ”are   ”
402,here he knocked his pipe out with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn and proceeded
403,then r
404,he braced himself
405,he clenched himself
406,qualities that would have saved a ship own company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water   ”endurance and justice foresight devotion skill came to his help
407,r is then   ”what is r
408,a shutter like the leathern eyelid of a lizard flickered over the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter r in that flash of darkness he heard people saying   ”he was a failure   ”that r was beyond him
409,he would never reach r on to r once more
410,are   ”
411,qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes of the polar region would have made him the leader the guide the counsellor whose temper neither sanguine nor despondent surveys with equanimity what is to be and faces it came to his help again
412,are   ”
413,the lizard own eye flickered once more
414,the veins on his forehead bulged
415,the geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and displayed among its leaves he could see without wishing it that old that obvious distinction between the two classes of men on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who plodding and persevering repeat the whole alphabet in order twenty six letters in all from start to finish on the other the gifted the inspired who miraculously lump all the letters together in one flash   ”the way of genius
416,he had not genius he laid no claim to that but he had or might have had the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from a to z accurately in order
417,meanwhile he stuck at q on then on to r
418,feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes stole upon him paling the colour of his eyes giving him even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace the bleached look of withered old age
419,yet he would not die lying down he would find some crag of rock and there his eyes fixed on the storm trying to the end to pierce the darkness he would die standing
420,he would never reach r
421,he stood stock still by the urn with the geranium flowing over it
422,how many men in a thousand million he asked himself reach z after all
423,surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that and answer without treachery to the expedition behind him one perhaps
424,one in a generation
425,is he to be blamed then if he is not that one
426,provided he has toiled honestly given to the best of his power and till he has no more left to give
427,and his fame lasts how long
428,it is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter
429,his fame lasts perhaps two thousand years
430,and what are two thousand years
431,asked mr ramsay ironically staring at the hedge
432,what indeed if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages
433,the very stone one kicks with one own boot will outlast shakespeare
434,his own little light would shine not very brightly for a year or two and would then be merged in some bigger light and that in a bigger still
435,he looked into the hedge into the intricacy of the twigs
436,who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow and square his shoulders so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post the fine figure of a soldier
437,mr ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very upright by the urn
438,who shall blame him if so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame upon search parties upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones
439,finally who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition if having adventured to the uttermost and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives and does not on the whole object to live but requires sympathy and whisky and some one to tell the story of his suffering to at once
440,who shall blame him
441,who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son who very distant at first gradually come closer and closer till lips and book and head are clearly before him though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before her   ”who will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world
442,but his son hated him
443,he hated him for coming up to them for stopping and looking down on them he hated him for interrupting them he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures for the magnificence of his head for his exactingness and egotism for there he stood commanding them to attend to him but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father own emotion which vibrating round them disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother
444,by looking fixedly at the page he hoped to make him move on by pointing his finger at a word he hoped to recall his mother own attention which he knew angrily wavered instantly his father stopped
445,but no
446,nothing would make mr ramsay move on
447,there he stood demanding sympathy
448,mrs ramsay who had been sitting loosely folding her son in her arm braced herself and half turning seemed to raise herself with an effort and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy a column of spray looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force burning and illuminating quietly though she sat taking up her stocking again and into this delicious fecundity this fountain and spray of life the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself like a beak of brass barren and bare
449,he wanted sympathy
450,he was a failure he said
451,mrs ramsay flashed her needles
452,mr ramsay repeated never taking his eyes from her face that he was a failure
453,she blew the words back at him
454,charles tansley she said
455,but he must have more than that
456,it was sympathy he wanted to be assured of his genius first of all and then to be taken within the circle of life warmed and soothed to have his senses restored to him his barrenness made furtile and all the rooms of the house made full of life   ”the drawing room behind the drawing room the kitchen above the kitchen the bedrooms and beyond them the nurseries they must be furnished they must be filled with life
457,charles tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time she said
458,but he must have more than that
459,he must have sympathy
460,he must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life was needed not only here but all over the world
461,flashing her needles confident upright she created drawing room and kitchen set them all aglow bade him take his ease there go in and out enjoy himself
462,she laughed she knitted
463,standing between her knees very stiff james felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass the arid scimitar of the male which smote mercilessly again and again demanding sympathy
464,he was a failure he repeated
465,well look then feel then
466,flashing her needles glancing round about her out of the window into the room at james himself she assured him beyond a shadow of a doubt by her laugh her poise her competence as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child that it was real the house was full the garden blowing
467,if he put implicit faith in her nothing should hurt him however deep he buried himself or climed high not for a second should he find himself without her
468,so boasting of her capacity to surround and protect there was scarcely a she will of herself left for her to know herself by all was so lavished and spent and james as he stood stiff between her knees felt her rise in a rosy flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass the arid scimitar of his father the egotistical man plunged and smote demanding sympathy
469,filled with her words like a child who drops off satisfied he said at last looking at her with humble gratitude restored renewed that he would take a turn he would watch the children playing cricket
470,he went
471,immediately mrs ramsey seemed to fold herself together one petal closed in another and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself so that she had only strength enough to move her finger in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion across the page of grimm own fairy story while there throbbed through her like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat the rapture of successful creation
472,every throb of this pulse seemed as he walked away to enclose her and her husband and to give to each that solace which two different notes one high one low struck together seem to give each other as they combine
473,yet as the resonance died and she turned to the fairy tale again mrs ramsey felt not only exhausted in body afterwards not at the time she always felt this but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin
474,not that as she read aloud the story of the fisherman own wife she knew precisely what it came from nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully ominously a wave fall how it came from this she did not like even for a second to feel finer than her husband and further could not bear not being entirely sure when she spoke to him of the truth of what she said
475,universities and people wanting him lectures and books and their being of the highest importance   ”all that she did not doubt for a moment but it was their relation and his coming to her like that openly so that any one could see that discomposed her for then people said he depended on her when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important and what she gave the world in comparison with what he gave negligable
476,but then again it was the other thing too   ”not being able to tell him the truth being afraid for instance about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be fifty pounds perhaps to mend it and then about his books to be afraid that he might guess what she a little suspected that his last book was not quite his best book she gathered that from william bankes and then to hide small daily things and the children seeing it and the burden it laid on them   ”all this diminished the entire joy the pure joy of the two notes sounding together and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness
477,a shadow was on the page she looked up
478,it was augustus carmichael shuffling past precisely now at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships that the most perfect was flawed and could not bear the examination which loving her husband with her instinct for truth she turned upon it when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness and impeded in her proper function by these lies these exaggerations   ”it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation that mr carmichael shuffled past in his yellow slippers and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out as he passed
479,going indoors mr carmichael
480,he said nothing
481,he took opium
482,the children said he had stained his beard yellow with it
483,perhaps
484,what was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy came to them every year as an escape and yet every year she felt the same thing he did not trust her
485,she said i am going to the town shall i get you stamps paper tobacco and she felt him wince
486,he did not trust her
487,it was his wife own doing
488,she remembered that iniquity of his wife own towards him which had made her turn to steel and adamant there in the horrible little room in st john own wood when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house
489,he was unkempt he dropped things on his coat he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do and she turned him out of the room
490,she said in her odious way now mrs ramsay and i want to have a little talk together and mrs ramsay could see as if before her eyes the innumerable miseries of his life
491,had he money enough to buy tobacco
492,did he have to ask her for it
493,half a crown
494,eighteenpence
495,oh she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer
496,and always now why she could not guess except that it came probably from that woman somehow he shrank from her
497,he never told her anything
498,but what more could she have done
499,there was a sunny room given up to him
500,the children were good to him
501,never did she show a sign of not wanting him
502,she went out of her way indeed to be friendly
503,do you want stamps do you want tobacco
504,here is a book you might like and so on
505,and after all   ”after all here insensibly she drew herself together physically the sense of her own beauty becoming as it did so seldom present to her after all she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her for instance george manning mr wallace famous as they were they would come to her of an evening quietly and talk alone over her fire
506,she bore about with her she could not help knowing it the torch of her beauty she carried it erect into any room that she entered and after all veil it as she might and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her her beauty was apparent
507,she had been admired
508,she had been loved
509,she had entered rooms where mourners sat
510,tears had flown in her presence
511,men and women too letting go to the multiplicity of things had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity
512,it injured her that he should shrink
513,it hurt her
514,and yet not cleanly not rightly
515,that was what she minded coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband the sense she had now when mr carmichael shuffled past just nodding to her question with a book beneath his arm in his yellow slippers that she was suspected and that all this desire of hers to give to help was vanity
516,for her own self satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help to give that people might say of her o mrs ramsay dear mrs ramsaymrs ramsay of course and need her and send for her and admire her
517,was it not secretly this that she wanted and therefore when mr carmichael shrank away from her as he did at this moment making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her and of human relations how flawed they are how despicable how self seeking at their best
518,shabby and worn out and not presumably her cheeks were hollow her hair was white any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy she had better devote her mind to the story of the fisherman and his wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness none of her children was as sensitive as he was her son james
519,the man own heart grew heavy she read aloud and he would not go he said to himself it is not right and yet he went and when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue and grey and thick and no longer so green and yellow but it was still quiet and he stood there and said   ”
520,mrs ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop
521,why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket
522,but he did not speak he looked he nodded he approved he went on
523,he slipped seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause signified some conclusion seeing his wife and child seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought and bore written up among their leaves as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading   ”he slipped seeing all this smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in the times about the number of americans who visit shakespeare own house every year
524,if shakespeare had never existed he asked would the world have differed much from what it is today
525,does the progress of civilization depend upon great men
526,is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the pharaohs
527,is the lot of the average human being however he asked himself the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization
528,possibly not
529,possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class
530,the liftman in the tube is an eternal necessity
531,the thought was distasteful to him
532,he tossed his head
533,to avoid it he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts
534,he would argue that the world exists for the average human being that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life they do not express it
535,nor is shakespeare necessary to it
536,not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge
537,all this would have to be dished up for the young men at cardiff next month he thought here on his terrace he was merely foraging and picnicking he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood
538,it was all familiar this turning that stile that cut across the fields
539,hours he would spend thus with his pipe of an evening thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there the life of this statesman here with poems and with anecdotes with figures too this thinker that soldier all very brisk and clear but at length the lane the field the common the fruitful nut tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always tied his horse to a tree and proceeded on foot alone
540,he reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath
541,it was his fate his peculiarity whether he wished it or not to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away and there to stand like a desolate sea bird alone
542,it was his power his gift suddenly to she would all superfluities to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer even physically yet lost none of his intensity of mind and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on   ”that was his fate his gift
543,but having thrown away when he dismounted all gestures and fripperies all trophies of nuts and roses and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision and it was in this guise that he inspired in william bankes intermittently and in charles tansley obsequiouslyand in his wife now when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn profoundly reverence and pity and gratitude too as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone
544,but the father of eight children has no choice
545,muttering half aloud so he broke off turned sighed raised his eyes sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy filled his pipe
546,he turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on which had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over to deprecate it as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes
547,it was true he was for the most part happy he had his wife he had his children he had promised in six weeks time to talk some nonsense to the young men of cardiff about locke hume berkeley and the causes of the french revolution
548,but this and his pleasure in it his glory in the phrases he made in the ardour of youth in his wife own beauty in the tributes that reached him from swansea cardiff exeter southampton kidderminster oxford cambridge   ”all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase talking nonsense because in effect he had not done the thing he might have done
549,it was a disguise it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings who could not say this is what i like   ”this is what i am and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe who wondered why such concealments should be necessary why he needed always praise why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time
550,teaching and preaching is beyond human power lily suspected
551,she was putting away her things
552,if you are exalted you must somehow come a cropper
553,mrs ramsay gave him what he asked too easily
554,then the change must be so upsetting lily said
555,he comes in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking nonsense
556,imagine what a change from the things he thinks about she said
557,he was bearing down upon them
558,now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea
559,now he had turned away again
560,yes mr bankes said watching him go
561,it was a thousand pities
562,lily had said something about his frightening her   ”he changed from one mood to another so suddenly
563,yes said mr bankes it was a thousand pities that ramsay could not behave a little more like other people
564,for he liked lily briscoe he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly
565,it was for that reason he said that the young do not read carlyle
566,a crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold why should he preach to us
567,was what mr bankes understood that young people said nowadays
568,it was a thousand pities if you thought as he did that carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind
569,lily was ashamed to say that she had not read carlyle since she was at school
570,but in her opinion one liked mr ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end
571,it was not that she minded
572,for who could be deceived by him
573,he asked you quite openly to flatter him to admire him his little dodges deceived nobody
574,what she disliked was his narrowness his blindness she said looking after him
575,a bit of a hypocrite
576,mr bankes suggested looking too at mr ramsay own back for was he not thinking of his friendship and of cam refusing to give him a flower and of all those boys and girls and his own house full of comfort but since his wife own death quiet rather
577,of course he had his workall the same he rather wished lily to agree that ramsay was as he said a bit of a hypocrite
578,lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes looking up looking down
579,looking up there he was   ”mr
580,ramsay   ”advancing towards them swinging careless oblivious remote
581,a bit of a hypocrite
582,she repeated
583,oh no   ”the most sincere of men the truest here he was the best but looking down she thought he is absorbed in himself he is tyrannical he is unjust and kept looking down purposely for only so could she keep steady staying with the ramsays
584,directly one looked up and saw them what she called being in love flooded them
585,they became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love
586,the sky stuck to them the birds sang through them
587,and what was even more exciting she felt too as she saw mr ramsay bearing down and retreating and mrs ramsay sitting with james in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending how life from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it there with a dash on the beach
588,mr bankes expected her to answer
589,and she was about to say something criticizing mrs ramsay how she was alarming too in her way high handed or words to that effect when mr bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture
590,for such it was considering his age turned sixty and his cleanliness and his impersonality and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him
591,for him to gaze as lily saw him gazing at mrs ramsay was a rapture equivalent lily felt to the loves of dozens of young men and perhaps mrs ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men
592,it was love she thought pretending to move her canvas distilled and filtered love that never attempted to clutch its object but like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols or poets their phrases was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain
593,so it was indeed
594,the world by all means should have shared it could mr bankes have said why that woman pleased him so why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem so that he rested in contemplation of it and felt as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants that barbarity was tamed the reign of chaos subdued
595,such a rapture   ”for by what other name could one call it
596,  ”made lily briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say
597,it was nothing of importance something about mrs ramsay
598,it paled beside this rapture this silent stare for which she felt intense gratitude for nothing so solaced her eased her of the perplexity of life and miraculously raised its burdens as this sublime power this heavenly gift and one would no more disturb it while it lasted than break up the shaft of sunlight lying level across the floor
599,that people should love like this that mr bankes should feel this for mrs ramsey she glanced at him musing was helpful was exalting
600,she wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old rag menially on purpose
601,she took shelter from the reverence which covered all women she felt herself praised
602,let him gaze she would steal a look at her picture
603,she could have wept
604,it was bad it was bad it was infinitely bad
605,she could have done it differently of course the colour could have been thinned and faded the shapes etherealised that was how paunceforte would have seen it
606,but then she did not see it like that
607,she saw the colour burning on a framework of steel the light of a butterfly own wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral
608,of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained
609,and it would never be seen never be hung even and there was mr tansley whispering in her ear women cannot paint women cannot write
610,she now remembered what she had been going to say about mrs ramsay
611,she did not know how she would have put it but it would have been something critical
612,she had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness
613,looking along the level of mr bankes own glance at her she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped they could only seek shelter under the shade which mr bankes extended over them both
614,looking along his beam she added to it her different ray thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people bowed over her book the best perhaps but also different too from the perfect shape which one saw there
615,but why different and how different
616,she asked herself scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now yet she vowed she would inspire them force them to move flow do her bidding tomorrow
617,how did she differ
618,what was the spirit in her the essential thing by which had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa you would have known it from its twisted finger hers indisputably
619,she was like a bird for speed an arrow for directness
620,she was willful she was commanding of course lily reminded herself i am thinking of her relations with women and i am much younger an insignificant person living off the brompton road
621,she opened bedroom windows
622,she shut doors
623,so she tried to start the tune of mrs ramsay in her head
624,arriving late at night with a light tap on one own bedroom door wrapped in an old fur coat for the setting of her beauty was always that   ”hasty but apt she would enact again whatever it might be   ”charles tansley losing his umbrella mr carmichael snuffling and sniffing mr bankes saying the vegetable salts are lost
625,all this she would adroitly shape even maliciously twist and moving over to the window in pretence that she must go   ”it was dawn she could see the sun rising   ”half turn back more intimately but still always laughing insist that she must minta must they all must marry since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her but mrs ramsay cared not a fig for her painting or triumphs won by her probably mrs ramsay had had her share of those and here she saddened darkened and came back to her chair there could be no disputing this an unmarried woman she lightly took her hand for a moment an unmarried woman has missed the best of life
626,the house seemed full of children sleeping and mrs ramsay listening shaded lights and regular breathing
627,oh but lily would say there was her father her home even had she dared to say it her painting
628,but all this seemed so little so virginal against the other
629,yet as the night wore on and white lights parted the curtains and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law plead for it she liked to be alone she liked to be herself she was not made for that and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth and confront mrs ramsay own simple certainty and she was childlike now that her dear lily her little brisk was a fool
630,then she remembered she had laid her head on mrs ramsay own lap and laughed and laughed and laughed laughed almost hysterically at the thought of mrs ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand
631,there she sat simple serious
632,she had recovered her sense of her now   ”this was the glove own twisted finger
633,but into what sanctuary had one penetrated
634,lily briscoe had looked up at last and there was mrs ramsay unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter still presiding but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished and in its stead something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover   ”the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon
635,was it wisdom
636,was it knowledge
637,was it once more the deceptiveness of beauty so that all one own perceptions half way to truth were tangled in a golden mesh
638,or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly lily briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all
639,every one could not be as helter skelter hand to mouth as she was
640,but if they knew could they tell one what they knew
641,sitting on the floor with her arms round mrs ramsay own knees close as she could get smiling to think that mrs ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was physically touching her were stood like the treasures in the tombs of kings tablets bearing sacred inscriptions which if one could spell them out would teach one everything but they would never be offered openly never made public
642,what art was there known to love or cunning by which one pressed through into those secret chambers
643,what device for becoming like waters poured into one jar inextricably the same one with the object one adored
644,could the body achieve or the mind subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain
645,or the heart
646,could loving as people called it make her and mrs ramsay one
647,for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired not inscriptions on tablets nothing that could be written in any language known to men but intimacy itself which is knowledge she had thought leaning her head on mrs ramsay own knee
648,nothing happened
649,nothing
650,nothing as she leant her head against mrs ramsay own knee
651,and yet she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up in mrs ramsay own heart
652,how then she had asked herself did one know one thing or another thing about people sealed as they were
653,only like a bee drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste one haunted the dome shaped hive ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings the hives which were people
654,mrs ramsay rose
655,lily rose
656,mrs ramsay went
657,for days there hung about her as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of more vividly than anything she said the sound of murmuring and as she sat in the wicker arm chair in the drawing room window she wore to lily own eyes an august shape the shape of a dome
658,this ray passed level with mr bankes own ray straight to mrs ramsay sitting reading there with james at her knee
659,but now while she still looked mr bankes had done
660,he had put on his spectacles
661,he had stepped back
662,he had raised his hand
663,he had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes when lily rousing herself saw what he was at and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it
664,she would have snatched her picture off the easel but she said to herself one must
665,she braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture
666,one must she said one must
667,and if it must be seen mr bankes was less alarming than another
668,but that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty three years the deposit of each day own living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony
669,at the same time it was immensely exciting
670,nothing could be cooler and quieter
671,taking out a pen knife mr bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle
672,what did she wish to indicate by the triangular purple shape just there
673,he asked
674,it was mrs ramsay reading to james she said
675,she knew his objection   ” that no one could tell it for a human shape
676,but she had made no attempt at likeness she said
677,for what reason had she introduced them then
678,he asked
679,why indeed
680,  ”except that if there in that corner it was bright here in this she felt the need of darkness
681,simple obvious commonplace as it was mr bankes was interested
682,mother and child then   ”objects of universal veneration and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty   ”might be reduced he pondered to a purple shadow without irreverence
683,but the picture was not of them she said
684,or not in his sense
685,there were other senses too in which one might reverence them
686,by a shadow here and a light there for instance
687,her tribute took that form if as she vaguely supposed a picture must be a tribute
688,a mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence
689,a light here required a shadow there
690,he considered
691,he was interested
692,he took it scientifically in complete good faith
693,the truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side he explained
694,the largest picture in his drawing room which painters had praised and valued at a higher price than he had given for it was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the kennet
695,he had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the kennet he said
696,lily must come and see that picture he said
697,but now   ”he turned with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas
698,the question being one of the relations of masses of lights and shadows which to be honest he had never considered before he would like to have it explained   ”what then did she wish to make of it
699,and he indicated the scene before them
700,she looked
701,she could not show him what she wished to make of it could not see it even herself without a brush in her hand
702,she took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent minded manner subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children   ”her picture
703,it was a question she remembered how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left
704,she might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object james perhaps so
705,but the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken
706,she stopped she did not want to bore him she took the canvas lightly off the easel
707,but it had been seen it had been taken from her
708,this man had shared with her something profoundly intimate
709,and thanking mr ramsay for it and mrs ramsay for it and the hour and the place crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected   ”that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody   ”the strangest feeling in the world and the most exhilarating   ”she nicked the catch of her paint box to more firmly than was necessary and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint box the lawn mr bankes and that wild villain cam dashing past
710,for cam grazed the easel by an inch she would not stop for mr bankes and lily briscoe though mr bankes who would have liked a daughter of his own held out his hand she would not stop for her father whom she grazed also by an inch nor for her mother who called cam i want you a moment as she dashed past
711,she was off like a bird bullet or arrow impelled by what desire shot by whom at what directed who could say
712,what what
713,mrs ramsay pondered watching her
714,it might be a vision   ”of a she will of a wheelbarrow of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge or it might be the glory of speed no one knew
715,but when mrs ramsay called cam a second time the projectile dropped in mid career and cam came lagging back pulling a leaf by the way to her mother
716,what was she dreaming about mrs ramsay wondered seeing her engrossed as she stood there with some thought of her own so that she had to repeat the message twice   ”ask mildred if andrew miss doyle and mr rayley have come back
717,  ”the words seemed to be dropped into a well where if the waters were clear they were also so extraordinarily distorting that even as they descended one saw them twisting about to make heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child own mind
718,what message would cam give the cook
719,mrs ramsay wondered
720,and indeed it was only by waiting patiently and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks drinking soup out of a basin that mrs ramsay at last prompted that parrot like instinct which had picked up mildred own words quite accurately and could now produce them if one waited in a colourless singsong
721,shifting from foot to foot cam repeated the words no they have not and I have told ellen to clear away tea
722,minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then
723,that could only mean mrs ramsay thought one thing
724,she must accept him or she must refuse him
725,this going off after luncheon for a walk even though andrew was with them   ”what could it mean
726,except that she had decided rightly mrs ramsay thought and she was very very fond of minta to accept that good fellow who might not be brilliant but then thought mrs ramsay realising that james was tugging at her to make her go on reading aloud the fisherman and his wife she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations charles tansley for instance
727,anyhow it must have happened one way or the other by now
728,but she read next morning the wife awoke first and it was just daybreak and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her her husband was still stretching himself
729,but how could minta say now that she would not have him
730,not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone   ”for andrew would be off after his crabs   ”but possibly nancy was with them
731,she tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch
732,there they stood looking at the sky wondering about the weather and she had said thinking partly to cover their shyness partly to encourage them to be off for her sympathies were with paul
733,there is not a cloud anywhere within miles at which she could feel little charles tansley who had followed them out snigger
734,but she did it on purpose
735,whether nancy was there or not she could not be certain looking from one to the other in her mind own eye
736,she read on ah wife said the man why should we be king i do not want to be king well said the wife if you will not be king i will go to the flounder for i will be king
737,come in or go out cam she said knowing that cam was attracted only by the word flounder and that in a moment she would fidget and fight with james as usual
738,cam shot off
739,mrs ramsay went on reading relieved for she and james shared the same tastes and were comfortable together
740,and when he came to the sea it was quite dark grey and the water heaved up from below and smelt putrid
741,then he went and stood by it and said
742,flounder flounder in the sea
743,come i pray thee here to me
744,for my wife good ilsabil
745,wills not as I would have her will
746,well what does she want then said the flounder
747, and where were they now mrs ramsay wondered reading and thinking quite easily both at the same time for the story of the fisherman and his wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody and when should she be told if nothing happened she would have to speak seriously to minta for she could not go trapesing about all over the country even if nancy were with them she tried again unsuccessfully to visualize their backs going down the path and to count them she was responsible to minta own parents   ”the owl and the poker her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read the owl and the poker   ”yes they would be annoyed if they heard   ”and they were certain to hear   ”that minta staying with the ramsays had been seen etcetera etcetera etcetera he wore a wig in the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs she repeated fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which coming back from some party she had made to amuse her husband dear dear mrs ramsay said to herself how did they produce this incongruous daughter this tomboy minta with a hole in her stocking how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust pan the sand that the parrot had scattered and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits   ”interesting perhaps but limited after all   ”of that bird naturally one had asked her to lunch tea dinner finally to stay with them up at finlay which had resulted in some friction with the owl her mother and more calling and more conversation and more sand and really at the end of it she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime so she had said to her husband that night coming back from the party however minta cameyes she came mrs ramsay thought suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought and disengaging it found it to be this a woman had once accused her of robbing her of her daughter own affections something mrs doyle had said made her remember that charge again wishing to dominate wishing to interfere making people do what she wished   ”that was the charge against her and she thought it most unjust how could she help being like that to look at
748,no one could accuse her of taking pains to impress
749,she was often ashamed of her own shabbiness
750,nor was she domineering nor was she tyrannical
751,it was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy
752,about things like that she did feel passionately and would if she had the chance have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see
753,no hospital on the whole island
754,it was a disgrace
755,milk delivered at your door in london positively brown with dirt
756,it should be made illegal
757,a model dairy and a hospital up here   ”those two things she would have liked to do herself
758,but how
759,with all these children
760,when they were older then perhaps she would have time when they were all at school
761,oh but she never wanted james to grow a day older or cam either
762,these two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were demons of wickedness angels of delight never to see them grow up into long legged monsters
763,nothing made up up for the loss
764,when she read just now to james and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets and his eyes darkened she thought why should they grow up and lose all that
765,he was the most gifted the most sensitive of her children
766,but all she thought were full of promise
767,prue a perfect angel with the others and sometimes now at night especially she took one own breath away with her beauty
768,andrew   ”even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary
769,and nancy and roger they were both wild creatures now scampering about over the country all day long
770,as for rose her mouth was too big but she had a wonderful gift with her hands
771,if they had charades rose made the dresses made everything liked best arranging tables flowers anything
772,she did not like it that jasper should shoot birds but it was only a stage they all went through stages
773,why she asked pressing her chin on james own head should they grow up so fast
774,why should they go to school
775,she would have liked always to have had a baby
776,she was happiest carrying one in her arms
777,then people might say she was tyrannical domineering masterful if they chose she did not mind
778,and touching his hair with her lips she thought he will never be so happy again but stopped herself remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that
779,still it was true
780,they were happier now than they would ever be again
781,a tenpenny tea set made cam happy for days
782,she heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke
783,they came bustling along the passage
784,then the door sprang open and in they came fresh as roses staring wide awake as if this coming into the dining room after breakfast which they did every day of their lives was a positive event to them and so on with one thing after another all day long until she went up to say good night to them and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish   ”something they had heard something they had picked up in the garden
785,they all had their little treasuresand so she went down and said to her husband why must they grow up and lose it all
786,never will they be so happy again
787,and he was angry
788,why take such a gloomy view of life
789,he said
790,it is not sensible
791,for it was odd and she believed it to be true that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier more hopeful on the whole than she was
792,less exposed to human worries   ”perhaps that was it
793,he had always his work to fall back on
794,not that she herself was pessimistic as he accused her of being
795,only she thought life   ”and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes   ”her fifty years
796,there it was before her   ”life
797,life she thought   ”but she did not finish her thought
798,she took a look at life for she had a clear sense of it there something real something private which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband
799,a sort of transaction went on between them in which she was on one side and life was on another and she was always trying to get the better of it as it was of her and sometimes they parleyed when she sat alone there were she remembered great reconciliation scenes but for the most part oddly enough she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible hostile and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance
800,there were eternal problems suffering death the poor
801,there was always a woman dying of cancer even here
802,and yet she had said to all these children you shall go through it all
803,to eight people she had said relentlessly that and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds
804,for that reason knowing what was before them   ”love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places   ”she had often the feeling why must they grow up and lose it all
805,and then she said to herself brandishing her sword at life nonsense
806,they will be perfectly happy
807,and here she was she reflected feeling life rather sinister again making minta marry paul rayley because whatever she might feel about her own transaction she had had experiences which need not happen to every one she did not name them to herself she was driven on too quickly she knew almost as if it were an escape for her too to say that people must marry people must have children
808,was she wrong in this she asked herself reviewing her conduct for the past week or two and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon minta who was only twenty four to make up her mind
809,she was uneasy
810,had she not laughed about it
811,was she not forgetting again how strongly she influenced people
812,marriage needed   ”oh all sorts of qualities the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds one   ”she need not name it   ”that was essential the thing she had with her husband
813,had they that
814,then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman she read
815,but outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet houses and trees toppled over the mountains trembled rocks rolled into the sea the sky was pitch black and it thundered and lightened and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains and all with white foam at the top
816,she turned the page there were only a few lines more so that she would finish the story though it was past bed time
817,it was getting late
818,the light in the garden told her that and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety
819,what it was about she could not think at first
820,then she remembered paul and minta and andrew had not come back
821,she summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door standing looking up into the sky
822,andrew had his net and basket
823,that meant he was going to catch crabs and things
824,that meant he would climb out on to a rock he would be cut off
825,or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip
826,he would roll and then crash
827,it was growing quite dark
828,but she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story and added shutting the book and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself looking into james own eyes and there they are living still at this very time
829,and that is the end she said and she saw in his eyes as the interest of the story died away in them something else take its place something wondering pale like the reflection of a light which at once made him gaze and marvel
830,turning she looked across the bay and there sure enough coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke was the light of the lighthouse
831,it had been lit
832,in a moment he would ask her are we going to the lighthouse
833,and she would have to say no not tomorrow your father says not
834,happily mildred came in to fetch them and the bustle distracted them
835,but he kept looking back over his shoulder as mildred carried him out and she was certain that he was thinking we are not going to the lighthouse tomorrow and she thought he will remember that all his life
836,no she thought putting together some of the pictures he had cut out   ” a refrigerator a mowing machine a gentleman in evening dress   ” children never forget
837,for this reason it was so important what one said and what one did and it was a relief when they went to bed
838,for now she need not think about anybody
839,she could be herself by herself
840,and that was what now she often felt the need of   ”to think well not even to think
841,to be silent to be alone
842,all the being and the doing expansive glittering vocal evaporated and one shrunk with a sense of solemnity to being oneself a wedge shaped core of darkness something invisible to others
843,although she continued to knit and sat upright it was thus that she felt herself and this self having she would its attachments was free for the strangest adventures
844,when life sank down for a moment the range of experience seemed limitless
845,and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources she supposed one after another she lily augustus carmichael must feel our apparitions the things you know us by are simply childish
846,beneath it is all dark it is all spreading it is unfathomably deep but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by
847,her horizon seemed to her limitless
848,there were all the places she had not seen the indian plains she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in rome
849,this core of darkness could go anywhere for no one saw it
850,they could not stop it she thought exulting
851,there was freedom there was peace there was most welcome of all a summoning together a resting on a platform of stability
852,not as oneself did one find rest ever in her experience she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles but as a wedge of darkness
853,losing personality one lost the fret the hurry the stir and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace this rest this eternity and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the lighthouse the long steady stroke the last of the three which was her stroke for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw and this thing the long steady stroke was her stroke
854,often she found herself sitting and looking sitting and looking with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at   ”that light for example
855,and it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that   ”children do not forget children do not forget   ”which she would repeat and begin adding to it it will end it will end she said
856,it will come it will come when suddenly she added we are in the hands of the lord
857,but instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that
858,who had said it
859,not she she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean
860,she looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart purifying out of existence that lie any lie
861,she praised herself in praising the light without vanity for she was stern she was searching she was beautiful like that light
862,it was odd she thought how if one was alone one leant to inanimate things trees streams flowers felt they expressed one felt they became one felt they knew one in a sense were one felt an irrational tenderness thus she looked at that long steady light as for oneself
863,there rose and she looked and looked with her needles suspended there curled up off the floor of the mind rose from the lake of one own being a mist a bride to meet her lover
864,what brought her to say that we are in the hands of the lord she wondered
865,the insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her annoyed her
866,she returned to her knitting again
867,how could any lord have made this world
868,she asked
869,with her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason order justice but suffering death the poor
870,there was no treachery too base for the world to commit she knew that
871,no happiness lasted she knew that
872,she knitted with firm composure slightly pursing her lips and without being aware of it so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed though he was chuckling at the thought that hume the philosopher grown enormously fat had stuck in a bog he could not help noting as he passed the sternness at the heart of her beauty
873,it saddened him and her remoteness pained him and he felt as he passed that he could not protect her and when he reached the hedge he was sad
874,he could do nothing to help her
875,he must stand by and watch her
876,indeed the infernal truth was he made things worse for her
877,he was irritable   ”he was touchy
878,he had lost his temper over the lighthouse
879,he looked into the hedge into its intricacy its darkness
880,always mrs ramsay felt one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end some sound some sight
881,she listened but it was all very still cricket was over the children were in their baths there was only the sound of the sea
882,she stopped knitting she held the long reddish brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment
883,she saw the light again
884,with some irony in her interrogation for when one woke at all one own relations changed she looked at the steady light the pitiless the remorseless which was so much her yet so little her which had her at its beck and call she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed stroking the floor but for all that she thought watching it with fascination hypnotised as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight she had known happiness exquisite happiness intense happiness and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly as daylight faded and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt it is enough
885,it is enough
886,he turned and saw her
887,ah
888,she was lovely lovelier now than ever he thought
889,but he could not speak to her
890,he could not interrupt her
891,he wanted urgently to speak to her now that james was gone and she was alone at last
892,but he resolved no he would not interrupt her
893,she was aloof from him now in her beauty in her sadness
894,he would let her be and he passed her without a word though it hurt him that she should look so distant and he could not reach her he could do nothing to help her
895,and again he would have passed her without a word had she not at that very moment given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame and gone to him
896,for he wished she knew to protect her
897,she folded the green shawl about her shoulders
898,she took his arm
899,his beauty was so great she said beginning to speak of kennedy the gardener at once he was so awfully handsome that she could not dismiss him
900,there was a ladder against the greenhouse and little lumps of putty stuck about for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse
901,yes but as she strolled along with her husband she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed
902,she had it on the tip of her tongue to say as they strolled it will cost fifty pounds but instead for her heart failed her about money she talked about jasper shooting birds and he said at once soothing her instantly that it was natural in a boy and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long
903,her husband was so sensible so just
904,and so she said yes all children go through stages and began considering the dahlias in the big bed and wondering what about next year own flowers and had he heard the children own nickname for charles tansley she asked
905,the atheist they called him the little atheist
906,he is not a polished specimen said mr ramsay
907,far from it said mrs ramsay
908,she supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices mrs ramsay said wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs did they plant them
909,oh he has his dissertation to write said mr ramsay
910,she knew all about that said mrs ramsay
911,he talked of nothing else
912,it was about the influence of somebody upon something
913,well it is all he has to count on said mr ramsay
914,pray heaven he will not fall in love with prue said mrs ramsay
915,he would disinherit her if she married him said mr ramsay
916,he did not look at the flowers which his wife was considering but at a spot about a foot or so above them
917,there was no harm in him he added and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in england who admired his   ”when he choked it back
918,he would not bother her again about his books
919,these flowers seemed creditable mr ramsay said lowering his gaze and noticing something red something brown
920,yes but then these she had put in with her own hands said mrs ramsay
921,the question was what happened if she sent bulbs down did kennedy plant them
922,it was his incurable laziness she added moving on
923,if she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand he did sometimes do a stroke of work
924,so they strolled along towards the red hot pokers
925,you are teaching your daughters to exaggerate said mr ramsay reproving her
926,her aunt camilla was far worse than she was mrs ramsay remarked
927,nobody ever held up your aunt camilla as a model of virtue that I am aware of said mr ramsay
928,she was the most beautiful woman i ever saw said mrs ramsay
929,somebody else was that said mr ramsay
930,prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was said mrs ramsay
931,he saw no trace of it said mr ramsay
932,well then look tonight said mrs ramsay
933,they paused
934,he wished andrew could be induced to work harder
935,he would lose every chance of a scholarship if he did not
936,oh scholarships she said
937,mr ramsay thought her foolish for saying that about a serious thing like a scholarship
938,he should be very proud of andrew if he got a scholarship he said
939,she would be just as proud of him if he did not she answered
940,they disagreed always about this but it did not matter
941,she liked him to believe in scholarships and he liked her to be proud of andrew whatever he did
942,suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs
943,was not it late
944,she asked
945,they had not come home yet
946,he flicked his watch carelessly open
947,but it was only just past seven
948,he held his watch open for a moment deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace
949,to begin with it was not reasonable to be so nervous
950,andrew could look after himself
951,then he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now   ”here he became uncomfortable as if he were breaking into that solitude that aloofness that remoteness of hers
952,but she pressed him
953,what had he wanted to tell her she asked thinking it was about going to the lighthouse that he was sorry he had said damn you
954,but no
955,he did not like to see her look so sad he said
956,only wool gathering she protested flushing a little
957,they both felt uncomfortable as if they did not know whether to go on or go back
958,she had been reading fairy tales to james she said
959,no they could not share that they could not say that
960,they had reached the gap between the two clumps of red hot pokers and there was the lighthouse again but she would not let herself look at it
961,had she known that he was looking at her she thought she would not have let herself sit there thinking
962,she disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking
963,so she looked over her shoulder at the town
964,the lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind
965,and all the poverty all the suffering had turned to that mrs ramsay thought
966,the lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk
967,well if he could not share her thoughts mr ramsay said to himself he would be off then on his own
968,he wanted to go on thinking telling himself the story how hume was stuck in a bog he wanted to laugh
969,but first it was nonsense to be anxious about andrew
970,when he was andrew own age he used to walk about the country all day long with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him or thought that he had fallen over a cliff
971,he said aloud he thought he would be off for a day own walk if the weather held
972,he had had about enough of bankes and of carmichael
973,he would like a little solitude
974,yes she said
975,it annoyed him that she did not protest
976,she knew that he would never do it
977,he was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket
978,she worried about the boys but not about him
979,years ago before he had married he thought looking across the bay as they stood between the clumps of red hot pokers he had walked all day
980,he had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house
981,he had worked ten hours at a stretch an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire
982,that was the country he liked best over there those sandhills dwindling away into darkness
983,one could walk all day without meeting a soul
984,there was not a house scarcely not a single village for miles on end
985,one could worry things out alone
986,there were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time
987,the seals sat up and looked at you
988,it sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there alone   ”he broke off sighing
989,he had no right
990,the father of eight children   ”he reminded himself
991,and he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered
992,andrew would be a better man than he had been
993,prue would be a beauty her mother said
994,they would stem the flood a bit
995,that was a good bit of work on the whole   ”his eight children
996,they showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely for on an evening like this he thought looking at the land dwindling away the little island seemed pathetically small half swallowed up in the sea
997,poor little place he murmured with a sigh
998,she heard him
999,he said the most melancholy things but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual
1000,all this phrase making was a game she thought for if she had said half what he said she would have blown her brains out by now
1001,it annoyed her this phrase making and she said to him in a matter  of fact way that it was a perfectly lovely evening
1002,and what was he groaning about she asked half laughing half complaining for she guessed what he was thinking   ”he would have written better books if he had not married
1003,he was not complaining he said
1004,she knew that he did not complain
1005,she knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of
1006,and he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes and quickly he dropped it
1007,they turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver green spear like plants grew arm in arm
1008,his arm was almost like a young man own arm mrs ramsay thought thin and hard and she thought with delight how strong he still was though he was over sixty and how untamed and optimistic and how strange it was that being convinced as he was of all sorts of horrors seemed not to depress him but to cheer him
1009,was it not odd she reflected
1010,indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people born blind deaf and dumb to the ordinary things but to the extraordinary things with an eye like an eagle own
1011,his understanding often astonished her
1012,but did he notice the flowers
1013,no
1014,did he notice the view
1015,no
1016,did he even notice his own daughter own beauty or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef
1017,he would sit at table with them like a person in a dream
1018,and his habit of talking aloud or saying poetry aloud was growing on him she was afraid for sometimes it was awkward   ”
1019,best and brightest come away
1020,poor miss giddings when he shouted that at her almost jumped out of her skin
1021,but then mrs ramsay though instantly taking his side against all the silly giddingses in the world then she thought intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank then she thought stooping down to look a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours
1022,all the great men she had ever known she thought deciding that a rabbit must have got in were like that and it was good for young men though the atmosphere of lecture rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost simply to hear him simply to look at him
1023,but without shooting rabbits how was one to keep them down
1024,she wondered
1025,it might be a rabbit it might be a mole
1026,some creature anyhow was ruining her evening primroses
1027,and looking up she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full throbbing star and wanted to make her husband look at it for the sight gave her such keen pleasure
1028,but she stopped herself
1029,he never looked at things
1030,if he did all he would say would be poor little world with one of his sighs
1031,at that moment he said very fine to please her and pretended to admire the flowers
1032,but she knew quite well that he did not admire them or even realise that they were there
1033,it was only to please her
1034,ah but was that not lily briscoe strolling along with william bankes
1035,she focussed her short sighted eyes upon the backs of a retreating couple
1036,yes indeed it was
1037,did that not mean that they would marry
1038,yes it must
1039,what an admirable idea
1040,they must marry
1041,he had been to amsterdam mr bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with lily briscoe
1042,he had seen the rembrandts
1043,he had been to madrid
1044,unfortunately it was good friday and the prado was shut
1045,he had been to rome
1046,had miss briscoe never been to rome
1047,oh she should   ”it would be a wonderful experience for her   ”the sistine chapel michael angelo and padua with its giottos
1048,his wife had been in bad health for many years so that their sight seeing had been on a modest scale
1049,she had been to brussels she had been to paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill
1050,she had been to dresden there were masses of pictures she had not seen however lily briscoe reflected perhaps it was better not to see pictures they only made one hopelessly discontented with one own own work
1051,mr bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far
1052,we cannot all be titians and we cannot all be darwins he said at the same time he doubted whether you could have your darwin and your titian if it were not for humble people like ourselves
1053,lily would have liked to pay him a compliment you are not humble mr bankes she would have liked to have said
1054,but he did not want compliments most men do she thought and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures
1055,anyhow said lily tossing off her little insincerity she would always go on painting because it interested her
1056,yes said mr bankes he was sure she would and as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw the ramsays
1057,so that is marriage lily thought a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball
1058,that is what mrs ramsay tried to tell me the other night she thought
1059,for she was wearing a green shawl and they were standing close together watching prue and jasper throwing catches
1060,and suddenly the meaning which for no reason at all as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell descends on people making them symbolical making them representative came upon them and made them in the dusk standing looking the symbols of marriage husband and wife
1061,then after an instant the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again and they became as they met them mr and mrs ramsay watching the children throwing catches
1062,but still for a moment though mrs ramsay greeted them with her usual smile oh she is thinking we are going to get married lily thought and said i have triumphed tonight meaning that for once mr bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly still for one moment there was a sense of things having been blown apart of space of irresponsibility as the ball soared high and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches
1063,in the failing light they all looked sharp edged and ethereal and divided by great distances
1064,then darting backwards over the vast space for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand and her mother said have not they come back yet whereupon the spell was broken
1065,mr ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the lord own prayer and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study
1066,mrs ramsay bringing prue back into throwing catches again from which she had escaped asked
1067,did nancy go with them
1068,certainly nancy had gone with them since minta doyle had asked it with her dumb look holding out her hand as nancy made off after lunch to her attic to escape the horror of family life
1069,she supposed she must go then
1070,she did not want to go
1071,she did not want to be drawn into it all
1072,for as they walked along the road to the cliff minta kept on taking her hand
1073,then she would let it go
1074,then she would take it again
1075,what was it she wanted
1076,nancy asked herself
1077,there was something of course that people wanted for when minta took her hand and held it nancy reluctantly saw the whole world spread out beneath her as if it were constantinople seen through a mist and then however heavy eyed one might be one must needs ask is that santa sofia is that the golden horn
1078,so nancy asked when minta took her hand
1079,what is it that she wants is it that
1080,and what was that
1081,here and there emerged from the mist as nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her a pinnacle a dome prominent things without names
1082,but when minta dropped her hand as she did when they ran down the hillside all that the dome the pinnacle whatever it was that had protruded through the mist sank down into it and disappeared
1083,minta andrew observed was rather a good walker
1084,she wore more sensible clothes that most women
1085,she wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers
1086,she would jump straight into a stream and flounder across
1087,he liked her rashness but he saw that it would not do   ”she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days
1088,she seemed to be afraid of nothing   ”except bulls
1089,at the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course
1090,but she did not mind owning up to it in the least one must admit that
1091,she knew she was an awful coward about bulls she said
1092,she thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby
1093,she did not seem to mind what she said or did
1094,suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about
1095,damn your eyes damn your eyes
1096,they all had to join in and sing the chorus and shout out together
1097,damn your eyes damn your eyes
1098,but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting grounds before they got on to the beach
1099,fatal paul agreed springing up and as they went slithering down he kept quoting the guide book about these islands being justly celebrated for their park like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities
1100,but it would not do altogether this shouting and damning your eyes andrew felt picking his way down the cliff this clapping him on the back and calling him old fellow and all that it would not altogether do
1101,it was the worst of taking women on walks
1102,once on the beach they separated he going out on to the pope own nose taking his shoes off and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves
1103,she crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber like sea anemones who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock
1104,brooding she changed the pool into the sea and made the minnows into sharks and whales and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun and so brought darkness and desolation like god himself to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down
1105,out on the pale criss crossed sand high stepping fringed gauntleted stalked some fantastic leviathan she was still enlarging the pool and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side
1106,and then letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing hypnotised and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess the pool had diminished again flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body her own life and the lives of all the people in the world for ever to nothingness
1107,so listening to the waves crouching over the pool she brooded
1108,and andrew shouted that the sea was coming in so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there   ”oh heavens in each other own arms were paul and minta kissing probably
1109,she was outraged indignant
1110,she and andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it
1111,indeed they were rather sharp with each other
1112,she might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was andrew grumbled
1113,however they both felt it is not our fault
1114,they had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen
1115,all the same it irritated andrew that nancy should be a woman and nancy that andrew should be a man and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight
1116,it was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother own brooch   ” her grandmother own brooch the sole ornament she possessed   ”a weeping willow it was they must remember it set in pearls
1117,they must have seen it she said with the tears running down her cheeks the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life
1118,now she had lost it
1119,she would rather have lost anything than that
1120,she would go back and look for it
1121,they all went back
1122,they poked and peered and looked
1123,they kept their heads very low and said things shortly and gruffly
1124,paul rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting
1125,all this pother about a brooch really did not do at all andrew thought as paul told him to make a thorough search between this point and that
1126,the tide was coming in fast
1127,the sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute
1128,there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now
1129,we shall be cut off
1130,minta shrieked suddenly terrified
1131,as if there were any danger of that
1132,it was the same as the bulls all over again   ”she had no control over her emotions andrew thought
1133,women had not
1134,the wretched paul had to pacify her
1135,the men andrew and paul at once became manly and different from usual took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant rayley own stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again
1136,there was nothing more that could be done now
1137,if the brooch was there it would still be there in the morning they assured her but minta still sobbed all the way up to the top of the cliff
1138,it was her grandmother own brooch she would rather have lost anything but that and yet nancy felt it might be true that she minded losing her brooch but she was not crying only for that
1139,she was crying for something else
1140,we might all sit down and cry she felt
1141,but she did not know what for
1142,they drew ahead together paul and minta and he comforted her and said how famous he was for finding things
1143,once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch
1144,he would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it
1145,it seemed to him that it would be almost dark and he would be alone on the beach and somehow it would be rather dangerous
1146,he began telling her however that he would certainly find it and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn it was lost she knew that she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon
1147,and secretly he resolved that he would not tell her but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to edinburgh and buy her another just like it but more beautiful
1148,he would prove what he could do
1149,and as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him   ”his marriage his children his house and again he thought as they came out on to the high road which was shaded with high bushes how they would retreat into solitude together and walk on and on he always leading her and she pressing close to his side as she did now
1150,as they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through and he must tell some one   ”mrs
1151,ramsay of course for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done
1152,it had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him
1153,he would go straight to mrs ramsay because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it
1154,she had made him think he could do anything
1155,nobody else took him seriously
1156,but she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted
1157,he had felt her eyes on him all day today following him about though she never said a word as if she were saying yes you can do it i believe in you i expect it of you
1158,she had made him feel all that and directly they got back he looked for the lights of the house above the bay he would go to her and say I have done it mrs ramsay thanks to you
1159,and so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows
1160,they must be awfully late then
1161,people were getting ready for dinner
1162,the house was all lit up and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full and he said to himself childishly as he walked up the drive lights lights lights and repeated in a dazed way lights lights lights as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff
1163,but good heavens he said to himself putting his hand to his tie i must not make a fool of myself
1164,yes said prue in her considering way answering her mother own question i think nancy did go with them
1165,well then nancy had gone with them mrs ramsay supposed wondering as she put down a brush took up a comb and said come in to a tap at the door jasper and rose came in whether the fact that nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen it made it less likely somehow mrs ramsay felt very irrationally except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable
1166,they could not all be drowned
1167,and again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist life
1168,jasper and rose said that mildred wanted to know whether she should wait dinner
1169,not for the queen of england said mrs ramsay emphatically
1170,not for the empress of mexico she added laughing at jasper for he shared his mother own vice he too exaggerated
1171,and if rose liked she said while jasper took the message she might choose which jewels she was to wear
1172,when there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner one cannot keep things waiting for ever
1173,she was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late it was inconsiderate of them and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them that they should choose this very night to be out late when in fact she wished the dinner to be particularly nice since william bankes had at last consented to dine with them and they were having mildred own masterpiece   ”boeuf en daube
1174,everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready
1175,the beef the bayleaf and the wine   ”all must be done to a turn
1176,to keep it waiting was out of the question
1177,yet of course tonight of all nights out they went and they came in late and things had to be sent out things had to be kept hot the boeuf en daube would be entirely spoilt
1178,jasper offered her an opal necklace rose a gold necklace
1179,which looked best against her black dress
1180,which did indeed said mrs ramsay absent mindedly looking at her neck and shoulders but avoiding her face in the glass
1181,and then while the children rummaged among her things she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused her   ”the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on
1182,every time they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again because she thought the old rook the father rook old joseph was her name for him was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition
1183,he was a disreputable old bird with half his wing feathers missing
1184,he was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house
1185,look she said laughing
1186,they were actually fighting
1187,joseph and mary were fighting
1188,anyhow they all went up again and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes
1189,the movements of the wings beating out out out   ”she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself   ”was one of the loveliest of all to her
1190,look at that she said to rose hoping that rose would see it more clearly than she could
1191,for one own children so often gave one own own perceptions a little thrust forwards
1192,but which was it to be
1193,they had all the trays of her jewel case open
1194,the gold necklace which was italian or the opal necklace which uncle james had brought her from india or should she wear her amethysts
1195,choose dearests choose she said hoping that they would make haste
1196,but she let them take their time to choose she let rose particularly take up this and then that and hold her jewels against the black dress for this little ceremony of choosing jewels which was gone through every night was what rose liked best she knew
1197,she had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear
1198,what was the reason mrs ramsay wondered standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen divining through her own past some deep some buried some quite speechless feeling that one had for one own mother at rose own age
1199,like all feelings felt for oneself mrs ramsay thought it made one sad
1200,it was so inadequate what one could give in return and what rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was
1201,and rose would grow up and rose would suffer she supposed with these deep feelings and she said she was ready now and they would go down and jasper because he was the gentleman should give her his arm and rose as she was the lady should carry her handkerchief she gave her the handkerchief and what else
1202,oh yes it might be cold a shawl
1203,choose me a shawl she said for that would please rose who was bound to suffer so
1204,there she said stopping by the window on the landing there they are again
1205,joseph had settled on another tree  top
1206,do not you think they mind she said to jasper having their wings broken
1207,why did he want to shoot poor old joseph and mary
1208,he shuffled a little on the stairs and felt rebuked but not seriously for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds and they did not feel and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world but he rather liked her stories about mary and joseph
1209,she made him laugh
1210,but how did she know that those were mary and joseph
1211,did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night
1212,he asked
1213,but here suddenly like all grown up people she ceased to pay him the least attention
1214,she was listening to a clatter in the hall
1215,they have come back she exclaimed and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved
1216,then she wondered had it happened
1217,she would go down and they would tell her   ”but no
1218,they could not tell her anything with all these people about
1219,so she must go down and begin dinner and wait
1220,and like some queen who finding her people gathered in the hall looks down upon them and descends among them and acknowledges their tributes silently and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed she went down and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly as if she accepted what they could not say their tribute to her beauty
1221,but she stopped
1222,there was a smell of burning
1223,could they have let the boeuf en daube overboil
1224,she wondered pray heaven not when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly authoritatively that all those scattered about in attics in bedrooms on little perches of their own reading writing putting the last smooth to their hair or fastening dresses must leave all that and the little odds and ends on their washing tables and dressing tables and the novels on the bed  tables and the diaries which were so private and assemble in the dining room for dinner
1225,but what have i done with my life
1226,thought mrs ramsay taking her place at the head of the table and looking at all the plates making white circles on it
1227,william sit by me she said
1228,lily she said wearily over there
1229,they had that   ”paul rayley and minta doyle   ”she only this   ”an infinitely long table and plates and knives
1230,at the far end was her husband sitting down all in a heap frowning
1231,what at
1232,she did not know
1233,she did not mind
1234,she could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him
1235,she had a sense of being past everything through everything out of everything as she helped the soup as if there was an eddy   ”there   ” and one could be in it or one could be out of it and she was out of it
1236,it is all come to an end she thought while they came in one after another charles tansley   ”sit there please she said   ”augustus carmichael   ”and sat down
1237,and meanwhile she waited passively for some one to answer her for something to happen
1238,but this is not a thing she thought ladling out soup that one says
1239,raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy   ”that was what she was thinking this was what she was doing   ”ladling out soup   ”she felt more and more strongly outside that eddy or as if a shade had fallen and robbed of colour she saw things truly
1240,the room she looked round it was very shabby
1241,there was no beauty anywhere
1242,she forebore to look at mr tansley
1243,nothing seemed to have merged
1244,they all sat separate
1245,and the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her
1246,again she felt as a fact without hostility the sterility of men for if she did not do it nobody would do it and so giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped the old familiar pulse began beating as the watch begins ticking   ”one two three one two three
1247,and so on and so on she repeated listening to it sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news paper
1248,and so then she concluded addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to william bankes   ”poor man who had no wife and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight and in pity for him life being now strong enough to bear her on again she began all this business as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how had the ship sunk he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea
1249,did you find your letters i told them to put them in the hall for you she said to william bankes
1250,lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no man own land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon
1251,how old she looks how worn she looks lily thought and how remote
1252,then when she turned to william bankes smiling it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again and lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved why does she pity him
1253,for that was the impression she gave when she told him that his letters were in the hall
1254,poor william bankes she seemed to be saying as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people and the life in her her resolve to live again had been stirred by pity
1255,and it was not true lily thought it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people own
1256,he is not in the least pitiable
1257,he has his work lily said to herself
1258,she remembered all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure that she had her work
1259,in a flash she saw her picture and thought yes i shall put the tree further in the middle then i shall avoid that awkward space
1260,that is what i shall do
1261,that is what has been puzzling me
1262,she took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table cloth so as to remind herself to move the tree
1263,it is odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post yet one always wants one own letters said mr bankes
1264,what damned rot they talk thought charles tansley laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate which he had swept clean as if lily thought he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view he were determined to make sure of his meals
1265,everything about him had that meagre fixity that bare unloveliness
1266,but nevertheless the fact remained it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them
1267,she liked his eyes they were blue deep set frightening
1268,do you write many letters mr tansley asked mrs ramsay pitying him too lily supposed for that was true of mrs ramsay   ”she pitied men always as if they lacked something   ”women never as if they had something
1269,he wrote to his mother otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month said mr tansley shortly
1270,for he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women
1271,he had been reading in his room and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly superficial flimsy
1272,why did they dress
1273,he had come down in his ordinary clothes
1274,he had not got any dress clothes
1275,one never gets anything worth having by post   ”that was the sort of thing they were always saying
1276,they made men say that sort of thing
1277,yes it was pretty well true he thought
1278,they never got anything worth having from one year own end to another
1279,they did nothing but talk talk talk eat eat eat
1280,it was the women own fault
1281,women made civilisation impossible with all their charm all their silliness
1282,no going to the lighthouse tomorrow mrs ramsay he said asserting himself
1283,he liked her he admired her he still thought of the man in the drain pipe looking up at her but he felt it necessary to assert himself
1284,he was really lily briscoe thought in spite of his eyes but then look at his nose look at his hands the most uncharming human being she had ever met
1285,then why did she mind what he said
1286,women cannot write women cannot paint   ”what did that matter coming from him since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him and that was why he said it
1287,why did her whole being bow like corn under a wind and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort
1288,she must make it once more
1289,there is the sprig on the table cloth there is my painting i must move the tree to the middle that matters   ”nothing else
1290,could she not hold fast to that she asked herself and not lose her temper and not argue and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him
1291,oh mr tansley she said do take me to the lighthouse with you i should so love it
1292,she was telling lies he could see
1293,she was saying what she did not mean to annoy him for some reason
1294,she was laughing at him
1295,he was in his old flannel trousers
1296,he had no others
1297,he felt very rough and isolated and lonely
1298,he knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason she did not want to go to the lighthouse with him she despised him so did prue ramsay so did they all
1299,but he was not going to be made a fool of by women so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said all in a jerk very rudely it would be too rough for her tomorrow
1300,she would be sick
1301,it annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that with mrs ramsay listening
1302,if only he could be alone in his room working he thought among his books
1303,that was where he felt at his ease
1304,and he had never run a penny into debt he had never cost his father a penny since he was fifteen he had helped them at home out of his savings he was educating his sister
1305,still he wished he had known how to answer miss briscoe properly he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like that
1306,you would be sick
1307,he wished he could think of something to say to mrs ramsay something which would show her that he was not just a dry prig
1308,that was what they all thought him
1309,he turned to her
1310,but mrs ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william bankes
1311,yes take it away she said briefly interrupting what she was saying to william bankes to speak to the maid
1312,it must have been fifteen   ” no twenty years ago   ”that i last saw her she was saying turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk for she was absorbed by what they were saying
1313,so he had actually heard from her this evening
1314,and was carrie still living at marlow and was everything still the same
1315,oh she could remember it as if it were yesterday   ”on the river feeling it as if it were yesterday   ”going on the river feeling very cold
1316,but if the mannings made a plan they stuck to it
1317,never should she forget herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank
1318,and it was still going on mrs ramsay mused gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing room on the banks of the thames where she had been so very very cold twenty years ago but now she went among them like a ghost and it fascinated her as if while she had changed that particular day now become very still and beautiful had remained there all these years
1319,had carrie written to him herself
1320,she asked
1321,yes she says they are building a new billiard room he said
1322,no
1323,no
1324,that was out of the question
1325,building a new billiard room
1326,it seemed to her impossible
1327,mr bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it
1328,they were very well off now
1329,should he give her love to carrie
1330,oh said mrs ramsay with a little start no she added reflecting that she did not know this carrie who built a new billiard room
1331,but how strange she repeated to mr bankes own amusement that they should be going on there still
1332,for it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time
1333,how eventful her own life had been during those same years
1334,yet perhaps carrie manning had not thought about her either
1335,the thought was strange and distasteful
1336,people soon drift apart said mr bankes feeling however some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings and the ramsays
1337,he had not drifted apart he thought laying down his spoon and wiping his clean shaven lips punctiliously
1338,but perhaps he was rather unusual he thought in this he never let himself get into a groove
1339,he had friends in all circlesmrs
1340,ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot
1341,that was why he preferred dining alone
1342,all those interruptions annoyed him
1343,well thought william bankes preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure such are the sacrifices one own friends ask of one
1344,it would have hurt her if he had refused to come
1345,but it was not worth it for him
1346,looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now he would have been free to work
1347,yes he thought it is a terrible waste of time
1348,the children were dropping in still
1349,i wish one of you would run up to roger own room mrs ramsay was saying
1350,how trifling it all is how boring it all is he thought compared with the other thing   ” work
1351,here he sat drumming his fingers on the table cloth when he might have been   ”he took a flashing bird own eye view of his work
1352,what a waste of time it all was to be sure
1353,yet he thought she is one of my oldest friends
1354,i am by way of being devoted to her
1355,yet now at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him her beauty meant nothing to him her sitting with her little boy at the window   ” nothing nothing
1356,he wished only to be alone and to take up that book
1357,he felt uncomfortable he felt treacherous that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her
1358,the truth was that he did not enjoy family life
1359,it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself what does one live for
1360,why one asked oneself does one take all these pains for the human race to go on
1361,is it so very desirable
1362,are we attractive as a species
1363,not so very he thought looking at those rather untidy boys
1364,his favourite cam was in bed he supposed
1365,foolish questions vain questions questions one never asked if one was occupied
1366,is human life this
1367,is human life that
1368,one never had time to think about it
1369,but here he was asking himself that sort of question because mrs ramsay was giving orders to servants and also because it had struck him thinking how surprised mrs ramsay was that carrie manning should still exist that friendships even the best of them are frail things
1370,one drifts apart
1371,he reproached himself again
1372,he was sitting beside mrs ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her
1373,I am so sorry said mrs ramsy turning to him at last
1374,he felt rigid and barren like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them
1375,yet he must force his feet into them
1376,he must make himself talk
1377,unless he were very careful she would find out this treachery of his that he did not care a straw for her and that would not be at all pleasant he thought
1378,so he bent his head courteously in her direction
1379,how you must detest dining in this bear garden she said making use as she did when she was distracted of her social manner
1380,so when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting the chairman to obtain unity suggests that every one shall speak in french
1381,perhaps it is bad french french may not contain the words that express the speaker own thoughts nevertheless speaking french imposes some order some uniformity
1382,replying to her in the same language mr bankes said no not at all and mr tansley who had no knowledge of this language even spoke thus in words of one syllable at once suspected its insincerity
1383,they did talk nonsense he thought the ramsays and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy making a note which one of these days he would read aloud to one or two friends
1384,there in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe staying with the ramsays and what nonsense they talked
1385,it was worth while doing it once he would say but not again
1386,the women bored one so he would say
1387,of course ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children
1388,it would shape itself something like that but now at this moment sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him nothing had shaped itself at all
1389,it was all in scraps and fragments
1390,he felt extremely even physically uncomfortable
1391,he wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself
1392,he wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair looked at this person then at that person tried to break into their talk opened his mouth and shut it again
1393,they were talking about the fishing industry
1394,why did no one ask him his opinion
1395,what did they know about the fishing industry
1396,lily briscoe knew all that
1397,sitting opposite him could she not see as in an x ray photograph the ribs and thigh bones of the young man own desire to impress himself lying dark in the mist of his flesh   ”that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation
1398,but she thought screwing up her chinese eyes and remembering how he sneered at women cannot paint cannot write why should i help him to relieve himself
1399,there is a code of behaviour she knew whose seventh article it may be says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman whatever her own occupation might be to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones the ribs of his vanity of his urgent desire to assert himself as indeed it is their duty she reflected in her old maidenly fairness to help us suppose the tube were to burst into flames
1400,then she thought i should certainly expect mr tansley to get me out
1401,but how would it be she thought if neither of us did either of these things
1402,so she sat there smiling
1403,you are not planning to go to the lighthouse are you lily said mrs ramsay
1404,remember poor mr langley he had been round the world dozens of times but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband took him there are you a good sailor mr tansley she asked
1405,mr tansley raised a hammer swung it high in air but realising as it descended that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this said only that he had never been sick in his life
1406,but in that one sentence lay compact like gunpowder that his grandfather was a fisherman his father a chemist that he had worked his way up entirely himself that he was proud of it that he was charles tansley   ”a fact that nobody there seemed to realise but one of these days every single person would know it
1407,he scowled ahead of him
1408,he could almost pity these mild cultivated people who would be blown sky high like bales of wool and barrels of apples one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him
1409,will you take me mr tansley said lily quickly kindly for of course if mrs ramsay said to her as in effect she did i am drowning my dear in seas of fire unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there life will run upon the rocks   ”indeed i hear the grating and the growling at this minute my nerves are taut as fiddle strings another touch and they will snap   ”when mrs ramsay said all this as the glance in her eyes said it of course for the hundred and fiftieth time lily briscoe had to renounce the experiment   ”what happens if one is not nice to that young man there   ”and be nice
1410,judging the turn in her mood correctly   ”that she was friendly to him now   ”he was relieved of his egotism and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby how his father used to fish him out with a boat hook that was how he had learnt to swim
1411,one of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the scottish coast he said
1412,he had been there with him in a storm
1413,this was said loudly in a pause
1414,they had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm
1415,ah thought lily briscoe as the conversation took this auspicious turn and she felt mrs ramsay own gratitude for mrs ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself ah she thought but what have not i paid to get it for you
1416,she had not been sincere
1417,she had done the usual trick   ”been nice
1418,she would never know him
1419,he would never know her
1420,human relations were all like that she thought and the worst if it had not been for mr bankes were between men and women
1421,inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought
1422,then her eye caught the salt cellar which she had placed there to remind her and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what mr tansley was saying
1423,let him talk all night if he liked it
1424,but how long do they leave men on a lighthouse she asked
1425,he told her
1426,he was amazingly well informed
1427,and as he was grateful and as he liked her and as he was beginning to enjoy himself so now mrs ramsay thought she could return to that dream land that unreal but fascinating place the mannings drawing room at marlow twenty years ago where one moved about without haste or anxiety for there was no future to worry about
1428,she knew what had happened to them what to her
1429,it was like reading a good book again for she knew the end of that story since it had happened twenty years ago and life which shot down even from this dining room table in cascades heaven knows where was sealed up there and lay like a lake placidly between its banks
1430,he said they had built a billiard room   ”was it possible
1431,would william go on talking about the mannings
1432,she wanted him to
1433,but no   ”for some reason he was no longer in the mood
1434,she tried
1435,he did not respond
1436,she could not force him
1437,she was disappointed
1438,the children are disgraceful she said sighing
1439,he said something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not acquire until later in life
1440,if at all said mrs ramsay merely to fill up space thinking what an old maid william was becoming
1441,conscious of his treachery conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate yet out of mood for it at present he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life sitting there waiting
1442,perhaps the others were saying something interesting
1443,what were they saying
1444,that the fishing season was bad that the men were emigrating
1445,they were talking about wages and unemployment
1446,the young man was abusing the government
1447,william bankes thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable heard him say something about one of the most scandalous acts of the present government
1448,lily was listening mrs ramsay was listening they were all listening
1449,but already bored lily felt that something was lacking mr bankes felt that something was lacking
1450,pulling her shawl round her mrs ramsay felt that something was lacking
1451,all of them bending themselves to listen thought pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed for each thought the others are feeling this they are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen whereas i feel nothing at all
1452,but perhaps thought mr bankes as he looked at mr tansley here is the man
1453,one was always waiting for the man
1454,there was always a chance
1455,at any moment the leader might arise the man of genius in politics as in anything else
1456,probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies thought mr bankes doing his best to make allowances for he knew by some curious physical sensation as of nerves erect in his spine that he was jealous for himself partly partly more probably for his work for his point of view for his science and therefore he was not entirely open  minded or altogether fair for mr tansley seemed to be saying you have wasted your lives
1457,you are all of you wrong
1458,poor old fogies you are hopelessly behind the times
1459,he seemed to be rather cocksure this young man and his manners were bad
1460,but mr bankes bade himself observe he had courage he had ability he was extremely well up in the facts
1461,probably mr bankes thought as tansley abused the government there is a good deal in what he says
1462,tell me now he said
1463,so they argued about politics and lily looked at the leaf on the table cloth and mrs ramsay leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men wondered why she was so bored by this talk and wished looking at her husband at the other end of the table that he would say something
1464,one word she said to herself
1465,for if he said a thing it would make all the difference
1466,he went to the heart of things
1467,he cared about fishermen and their wages
1468,he could not sleep for thinking of them
1469,it was altogether different when he spoke one did not feel then pray heaven you do not see how little i care because one did care
1470,then realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him
1471,she looked at him thinking to find this in his face he would be looking magnificentbut not in the least
1472,he was screwing his face up he was scowling and frowning and flushing with anger
1473,what on earth was it about
1474,she wondered
1475,what could be the matter
1476,only that poor old augustus had asked for another plate of soup   ”that was all
1477,it was unthinkable it was detestable so he signalled to her across the table that augustus should be beginning his soup over again
1478,he loathed people eating when he had finished
1479,she saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes his brow and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode and then   ”thank goodness she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words
1480,he sat there scowling
1481,he had said nothing he would have her observe
1482,let her give him the credit for that
1483,but why after all should poor augustus not ask for another plate of soup
1484,he had merely touched ellen own arm and said
1485,ellen please another plate of soup and then mr ramsay scowled like that
1486,and why not
1487,mrs ramsay demanded
1488,surely they could let augustus have his soup if he wanted it
1489,he hated people wallowing in food mr ramsay frowned at her
1490,he hated everything dragging on for hours like this
1491,but he had controlled himself mr ramsay would have her observe disgusting though the sight was
1492,but why show it so plainly mrs ramsay demanded they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across each knowing exactly what the other felt
1493,everybody could see mrs ramsay thought
1494,there was rose gazing at her father there was roger gazing at his father both would be off in spasms of laughter in another second she knew and so she said promptly indeed it was time
1495,light the candles and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled at the sideboard
1496,why could he never conceal his feelings
1497,mrs ramsay wondered and she wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed
1498,perhaps he had perhaps he had not
1499,she could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there drinking his soup
1500,if he wanted soup he asked for soup
1501,whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same
1502,he did not like her she knew that but partly for that very reason she respected him and looking at him drinking soup very large and calm in the failing light and monumental and contemplative she wondered what he did feel then and why he was always content and dignified and she thought how devoted he was to andrew and would call him into his room and andrew said show him things
1503,and there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry till he reminded one of a cat watching birds and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word and her husband said poor old augustus   ”he is a true poet which was high praise from her husband
1504,now eight candles were stood down the table and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit
1505,what had she done with it mrs ramsay wondered for rose own arrangement of the grapes and pears of the horny pink lined she will of the bananas made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea of neptune own banquet of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of bacchus in some picture among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and goldthus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth was like a world in which one could take one own staff and climb hills she thought and go down into valleys and to her pleasure for it brought them into sympathy momentarily she saw that augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit plunged in broke off a bloom there a tassel here and returned after feasting to his hive
1506,that was his way of looking different from hers
1507,but looking together united them
1508,now all the candles were lit up and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light and composed as they had not been in the twilight into a party round a table for the night was now shut off by panes of glass which far from giving any accurate view of the outside world rippled it so strangely that here inside the room seemed to be order and dry land there outside a reflection in which things waved and vanished waterily
1509,some change at once went through them all as if this had really happened and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow on an island had their common because against that fluidity out there
1510,mrs ramsay who had been uneasy waiting for paul and minta to come in and unable she felt to settle to things now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation
1511,for now they must come and lily briscoe trying to analyse the because of the sudden exhilaration compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn when solidity suddenly vanished and such vast spaces lay between them and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room and the uncurtained windows and the bright mask like look of faces seen by candlelight
1512,some weight was taken off them anything might happen she felt
1513,they must come now mrs ramsay thought looking at the door and at that instant minta doyle paul rayley and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together
1514,they were awfully late they were horribly late minta said as they found their way to different ends of the table
1515,i lost my brooch   ”my grandmother own brooch said minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice and a suffusion in her large brown eyes looking down looking up as she sat by mr ramsay which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her
1516,how could she be such a goose he asked as to scramble about the rocks in jewels
1517,she was by way of being terrified of him   ”he was so fearfully clever and the first night when she had sat by him and he talked about george eliot she had been really frightened for she had left the third volume of middlemarch in the train and she never knew what happened in the end but afterwards she got on perfectly and made herself out even more ignorant than she was because he liked telling her she was a fool
1518,and so tonight directly he laughed at her she was not frightened
1519,besides she knew directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened she wore her golden haze
1520,sometimes she had it sometimes not
1521,she never knew why it came or why it went or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her
1522,yes tonight she had it tremendously she knew that by the way mr ramsay told her not to be a fool
1523,she sat beside him smiling
1524,it must have happened then thought mrs ramsay they are engaged
1525,and for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again   ” jealousy
1526,for he her husband felt it too   ”minta own glow he liked these girls these golden reddish girls with something flying something a little wild and harum scarum about them who did not scrape their hair off were not as he said about poor lily briscoe skimpy
1527,there was some quality which she herself had not some lustre some richness which attracted him amused him led him to make favourites of girls like minta
1528,they might cut his hair from him plait him watch chains or interrupt him at his work hailing him she heard them come along mr ramsay it is our turn to beat them now and out he came to play tennis
1529,but indeed she was not jealous only now and then when she made herself look in her glass a little resentful that she had grown old perhaps by her own fault
1530,the bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it
1531,she was grateful to them for laughing at him
1532,how many pipes have you smoked today mr ramsay and so on till he seemed a young man a man very attractive to women not burdened not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure but again as she had first known him gaunt but gallant helping her out of a boat she remembered with delightful ways like that she looked at him and he looked astonishingly young teasing minta
1533,for herself   ”put it down there she said helping the swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the boeuf en daube   ”for her own part she liked her boobies
1534,paul must sit by her
1535,she had kept a place for him
1536,really she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best
1537,they did not bother one with their dissertations
1538,how much they missed after all these very clever men
1539,how dried up they did become to be sure
1540,there was something she thought as he sat down very charming about paul
1541,his manners were delightful to her and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes
1542,he was so considerate
1543,would he tell her   ”now that they were all talking again   ”what had happened
1544,we went back to look for minta own brooch he said sitting down by her
1545,we   ”that was enough
1546,she knew from the effort the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said we we did this we did that
1547,they will say that all their lives she thought and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as marthe with a little flourish took the cover off
1548,the cook had spent three days over that dish
1549,and she must take great care mrs ramsay thought diving into the soft mass to choose a specially tender piece for william bankes
1550,and she peered into the dish with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine and thought this will celebrate the occasion   ”a curious sense rising in her at once freakish and tender of celebrating a festival as if two emotions were called up in her one profound   ”for what could be more serious than the love of man for woman what more commanding more impressive bearing in its bosom the seeds of death at the same time these lovers these people entering into illusion glittering eyed must be danced round with mockery decorated with garlands
1551,it is a triumph said mr bankes laying his knife down for a moment
1552,he had eaten attentively
1553,it was rich it was tender
1554,it was perfectly cooked
1555,how did she manage these things in the depths of the country
1556,he asked her
1557,she was a wonderful woman
1558,all his love all his reverence had returned and she knew it
1559,it is a french recipe of my grandmother own said mrs ramsay speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice
1560,of course it was french
1561,what passes for cookery in england is an abomination they agreed
1562,it is putting cabbages in water
1563,it is roasting meat till it is like leather
1564,it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables
1565,in which said mr bankes all the virtue of the vegetable is contained
1566,and the waste said mrs ramsay
1567,a whole french family could live on what an english cook throws away
1568,spurred on by her sense that william own affection had come back to her and that everything was all right again and that her suspense was over and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock she laughed she gesticulated till lily thought how childlike how absurd she was sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her talking about the skins of vegetables
1569,there was something frightening about her
1570,she was irresistible
1571,always she got her own way in the end lily thought
1572,now she had brought this off   ”paul and minta one might suppose were engaged
1573,mr bankes was dining here
1574,she put a spell on them all by wishing so simply so directly and lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit and supposed that it was partly that belief for her face was all lit up   ”without looking young she looked radiant in this strange this terrifying thing which made paul rayley sitting at her side all of a tremor yet abstract absorbed silent
1575,mrs ramsay lily felt as she talked about the skins of vegetables exalted that worshipped that held her hands over it to warm them to protect it and yet having brought it all about somehow laughed led her victims lily felt to the altar
1576,it came over her too now   ”the emotion the vibration of love
1577,how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul own side
1578,he glowing burning she aloof satirical he bound for adventure she moored to the shore he launched incautious she solitary left out   ”and ready to implore a share if it were a disaster in his disaster she said shyly
1579,when did minta lose her brooch
1580,he smiled the most exquisite smile veiled by memory tinged by dreams
1581,he shook his head
1582,on the beach he said
1583,I am going to find it he said I am getting up early
1584,this being kept secret from minta he lowered his voice and turned his eyes to where she sat laughing beside mr ramsay
1585,lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half hidden by some stone and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers
1586,but what did he reply to her offer
1587,she actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear let me come with you and he laughed
1588,he meant yes or no   ” either perhaps
1589,but it was not his meaning   ”it was the odd chuckle he gave as if he had said throw yourself over the cliff if you like i do not care
1590,he turned on her cheek the heat of love its horror its cruelty its unscrupulosity
1591,it scorched her and lily looking at minta being charming to mr ramsay at the other end of the table flinched for her exposed to these fangs and was thankful
1592,for at any rate she said to herself catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern she need not marry thank heaven she need not undergo that degradation
1593,she was saved from that dilution
1594,she would move the tree rather more to the middle
1595,such was the complexity of things
1596,for what happened to her especially staying with the ramsays was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time that is what you feel was one that is what i feel was the other and then they fought together in her mind as now
1597,it is so beautiful so exciting this love that i tremble on the verge of it and offer quite out of my own habit to look for a brooch on a beach also it is the stupidest the most barbaric of human passions and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem own paul own was exquisite into a bully with a crowbar he was swaggering he was insolent in the mile end road
1598,yet she said to herself from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love wreaths heaped and roses and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this   ”love while the women judging from her own experience would all the time be feeling this is not what we want there is nothing more tedious puerile and inhumane than this yet it is also beautiful and necessary
1599,well then well then
1600,she asked somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument as if in an argument like this one threw one own own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on
1601,so she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love
1602,then said mr bankes there is that liquid the english call coffee
1603,oh coffee said mrs ramsay
1604,but it was much rather a question she was thoroughly roused lily could see and talked very emphatically of real butter and clean milk
1605,speaking with warmth and eloquence she described the iniquity of the english dairy system and in what state milk was delivered at the door and was about to prove her charges for she had gone into the matter when all round the table beginning with andrew in the middle like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze her children laughed her husband laughed she was laughed at fire  encircled and forced to veil her crest dismount her batteries and only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to mr bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the british public
1606,purposely however for she had it on her mind that lily who had helped her with mr tansley was out of things she exempted her from the rest said lily anyhow agrees with me and so drew her in a little fluttered a little startled
1607,for she was thinking about love
1608,they were both out of things mrs ramsay had been thinking both lily and charles tansley
1609,both suffered from the glow of the other two
1610,he it was clear felt himself utterly in the cold no woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room
1611,poor fellow
1612,still he had his dissertation the influence of somebody upon something he could take care of himself
1613,with lily it was different
1614,she faded under minta own glow became more inconspicuous than ever in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little chinese eyes
1615,everything about her was so small
1616,yet thought mrs ramsay comparing her with minta as she claimed her help for lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots   ”he would talk by the hour about his boots of the two lily at forty will be the better
1617,there was in lily a thread of something a flare of something something of her own which mrs ramsay liked very much indeed but no man would she feared
1618,obviously not unless it were a much older man like william bankes
1619,but then he cared well mrs ramsay sometimes thought that he cared since his wife own death perhaps for her
1620,he was not in love of course it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many
1621,oh but nonsense she thought william must marry lily
1622,they have so many things in common
1623,lily is so fond of flowers
1624,they are both cold and aloof and rather self sufficing
1625,she must arrange for them to take a long walk together
1626,foolishly she had set them opposite each other
1627,that could be remedied tomorrow
1628,if it were fine they should go for a picnic
1629,everything seemed possible
1630,everything seemed right
1631,just now but this cannot last she thought dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots just now she had reached security she hovered like a hawk suspended like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly not noisily solemnly rather for it arose she thought looking at them all eating there from husband and children and friends all of which rising in this profound stillness she was helping william bankes to one very small piece more and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke like a fume rising upwards holding them safe together
1632,nothing need be said nothing could be said
1633,there it was all round them
1634,it partook she felt carefully helping mr bankes to a specially tender piece of eternity as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon there is a coherence in things a stability something she meant is immune from change and shines out she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights in the face of the flowing the fleeting the spectral like a ruby so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today already of peace of rest
1635,of such moments she thought the thing is made that endures
1636,yes she assured william bankes there is plenty for everybody
1637,andrew she said hold your plate lower or i shall spill it the boeuf en daube was a perfect triumph here she felt putting the spoon down where one could move or rest could wait now they were all helped listening could then like a hawk which lapses suddenly from its high station flaunt and sink on laughter easily resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty three
1638,that was the number it seemed on his watch
1639,what did it all mean
1640,to this day she had no notion
1641,a square root
1642,what was that
1643,her sons knew
1644,she leant on them on cubes and square roots that was what they were talking about now on voltaire and madame de stael on the character of napoleon on the french system of land tenure on lord rosebery on creevey own memoirs she let it uphold her and sustain her this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence which ran up and down crossed this way and that like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric upholding the world so that she could trust herself to it utterly even shut her eyes or flicker them for a moment as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree
1645,then she woke up
1646,it was still being fabricated
1647,william bankes was praising the waverly novels
1648,he read one of them every six months he said
1649,and why should that make charles tansley angry
1650,he rushed in all thought mrs ramsay because prue will not be nice to him and denounced the waverly novels when he knew nothing about it nothing about it whatsoever mrs ramsay thought observing him rather than listening to what he said
1651,she could see how it was from his manner   ”he wanted to assert himself and so it would always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife and so need not be always saying i   ”i   ”i
1652,for that was what his criticism of poor sir walter or perhaps it was jane austen amounted to
1653,i   ” i   ” i
1654,he was thinking of himself and the impression he was making as she could tell by the sound of his voice and his emphasis and his uneasiness
1655,success would be good for him
1656,at any rate they were off again
1657,now she need not listen
1658,it could not last she knew but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people and their thoughts and their feelings without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging trembling
1659,so she saw them she heard them but whatever they said had also this quality as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when at the same time one can see the ripple and the gravel something to the right something to the left and the whole is held together for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another she would be saying she liked the waverly novels or had not read them she would be urging herself forward now she said nothing
1660,for the moment she hung suspended
1661,ah but how long do you think it will last said somebody
1662,it was as if she had antennae trembling out from her which intercepting certain sentences forced them upon her attention
1663,this was one of them
1664,she scented danger for her husband
1665,a question like that would lead almost certainly to something being said which reminded him of his own failure
1666,how long would he be read   ”he would think at once
1667,william bankes who was entirely free from all such vanity laughed and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion
1668,who could tell what was going to last   ”in literature or indeed in anything else
1669,let us enjoy what we do enjoy he said
1670,his integrity seemed to mrs ramsay quite admirable
1671,he never seemed for a moment to think but how does this affect me
1672,but then if you had the other temperament which must have praise which must have encouragement naturally you began and she knew that mr ramsay was beginning to be uneasy to want somebody to say oh but your work will last mr ramsay or something like that
1673,he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying with some irritation that anyhow scott or was it shakespeare  would last him his lifetime
1674,he said it irritably
1675,everybody she thought felt a little uncomfortable without knowing why
1676,then minta doyle whose instinct was fine said bluffly absurdly that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare
1677,mr ramsay said grimly but his mind was turned away again that very few people liked it as much as they said they did
1678,but he added there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless and mrs ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow he would laugh at minta and she mrs ramsay saw realising his extreme anxiety about himself would in her own way see that he was taken care of and praise him somehow or other
1679,but she wished it was not necessary perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary
1680,anyhow she was free now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy
1681,they lasted he said
1682,he had read some of tolstoi at school
1683,there was one he always remembered but he had forgotten the name
1684,russian names were impossible said mrs ramsay
1685,vronsky said paul
1686,he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain
1687,vronsky said mrs ramsay oh anna karenina but that did not take them very far books were not in their line
1688,no charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books but it was all so mixed up with am i saying the right thing
1689,am i making a good impression
1690,that after all one knew more about him than about tolstoi whereas what paul said was about the thing simply not himself nothing else
1691,like all stupid people he had a kind of modesty too a consideration for what you were feeling which once in a way at least she found attractive
1692,now he was thinking not about himself or about tolstoi but whether she was cold whether she felt a draught whether she would like a pear
1693,no she said she did not want a pear
1694,indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit without realising it jealously hoping that nobody would touch it
1695,her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit among the rich purples of the lowland grapes then over the horny ridge of the she will putting a yellow against a purple a curved shape against a round shape without knowing why she did it or why every time she did it she felt more and more serene until oh what a pity that they should do it   ”a hand reached out took a pear and spoilt the whole thing
1696,in sympathy she looked at rose
1697,she looked at rose sitting between jasper and prue
1698,how odd that one own child should do that
1699,how odd to see them sitting there in a row her children jasper rose prue andrew almost silent but with some joke of their own going on she guessed from the twitching at their lips
1700,it was something quite apart from everything else something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room
1701,it was not about their father she hoped
1702,no she thought not
1703,what was it she wondered sadly rather for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there
1704,there was all that hoarded behind those rather set still mask like faces for they did not join in easily they were like watchers surveyors a little raised or set apart from the grown up people
1705,but when she looked at prue tonight she saw that this was not now quite true of her
1706,she was just beginning just moving just descending
1707,the faintest light was on her face as if the glow of minta opposite some excitement some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table cloth and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it
1708,she kept looking at minta shyly yet curiously so that mrs ramsay looked from one to the other and said speaking to prue in her own mind you will be as happy as she is one of these days
1709,you will be much happier she added because you are my daughter she meant her own daughter must be happier than other people own daughters
1710,but dinner was over
1711,it was time to go
1712,they were only playing with things on their plates
1713,she would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling
1714,he was having a joke with minta about a bet
1715,then she would get up
1716,she liked charles tansley she thought suddenly she liked his laugh
1717,she liked him for being so angry with paul and minta
1718,she liked his awkwardness
1719,there was a lot in that young man after all
1720,and lily she thought putting her napkin beside her plate she always has some joke of her own
1721,one need never bother about lily
1722,she waited
1723,she tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate
1724,well were they done now
1725,no
1726,that story had led to another story
1727,her husband was in great spirits tonight and wishing she supposed to make it all right with old augustus after that scene about the soup had drawn him in   ” they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college
1728,she looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral for she did not listen to the words
1729,the sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice minta own speaking alone reminded her of men and boys crying out the latin words of a service in some roman catholic cathedral
1730,she waited
1731,her husband spoke
1732,he was repeating something and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation and melancholy in his voice
1733,come out and climb the garden path luriana lurilee
1734,the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee
1735,the words she was looking at the window sounded as if they were floating like flowers on water out there cut off from them all as if no one had said them but they had come into existence of themselves
1736,and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves
1737,she did not know what they meant but like music the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice outside her self saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things
1738,she knew without looking round that every one at the table was listening to the voice saying
1739,i wonder if it seems to you luriana lurilee
1740,with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had as if this were at last the natural thing to say this were their own voice speaking
1741,but the voice had stopped
1742,she looked round
1743,she made herself get up
1744,augustus carmichael had risen and holding his table napkin so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting
1745,to see the kings go riding by over lawn and daisy lea with their palm leaves and cedar luriana lurilee
1746,and as she passed him he turned slightly towards her repeating the last words
1747,luriana lurilee
1748,and bowed to her as if he did her homage
1749,without knowing why she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before and with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through the door which he held open for her
1750,it was necessary now to carry everything a step further
1751,with her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked and then as she moved and took minta own arm and left the room it changed it shaped itself differently it had become she knew giving one last look at it over her shoulder already the past
1752,as usual lily thought
1753,there was always something that had to be done at that precise moment something that mrs ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly it might be with every one standing about making jokes as now not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking room into the drawing room up to the attics
1754,then one saw mrs ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with minta own arm in hers bethink her yes it is time for that now and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone
1755,and directly she went a sort of disintegration set in they wavered about went different ways mr bankes took charles tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening making the weight fall in a different direction as if lily thought seeing them go and hearing a word or two about the policy of the labour party they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings the change from poetry to politics struck her like that so mr bankes and charles mrs ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone
1756,where lily wondered was she going so quickly
1757,not that she did in fact run or hurry she went indeed rather slowly
1758,she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter and pick out one particular thing the thing that mattered to detach it separate it off clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things and so hold it before her and bring it to the tribunal where ranged about in conclave sat the judges she had set up to decide these things
1759,is it good is it bad is it right or wrong
1760,where are we all going to
1761,and so on
1762,so she righted herself after the shock of the event and quite unconsciously and incongruously used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position
1763,her world was changing they were still
1764,the event had given her a sense of movement
1765,all must be in order
1766,she must get that right and that right she thought insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees stillness and now again of the superb upward rise like the beak of a ship up a wave of the elm branches as the wind raised them
1767,for it was windy she stood a moment to look out
1768,it was windy so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves
1769,yes that was done then accomplished and as with all things done became solemn
1770,now one thought of it cleared of chatter and emotion it seemed always to have been only was shown now and so being shown struck everything into stability
1771,they would she thought going on again however long they lived come back to this night this moon this wind this house and to her too
1772,it flattered her where she was most susceptible of flattery to think how wound about in their hearts however long they lived she would be woven and this and this and this she thought going upstairs laughing but affectionately at the sofa on the landing her mother own at the rocking chair her father own at the map of the hebrides
1773,all that would be revived again in the lives of paul and minta the rayleys   ”she tried the new name over and she felt with her hand on the nursery door that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically the feeling was one of relief and happiness it was all one stream and chairs tables maps were hers were theirs it did not matter whose and paul and minta would carry it on when she was dead
1774,she turned the handle firmly lest it should squeak and went in pursing her lips slightly as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud
1775,but directly she came in she saw with annoyance that the precaution was not needed
1776,the children were not asleep
1777,it was most annoying
1778,mildred should be more careful
1779,there was james wide awake and cam sitting bolt upright and mildred out of bed in her bare feet and it was almost eleven and they were all talking
1780,what was the matter
1781,it was that horrid skull again
1782,she had told mildred to move it but mildred of course had forgotten and now there was cam wide awake and james wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago
1783,what had possessed edward to send them this horrid skull
1784,she had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there
1785,it was nailed fast mildred said and cam could not go to sleep with it in the room and james screamed if she touched it
1786,then cam must go to sleep it had great horns said cam   ”must go to sleep and dream of lovely palaces said mrs ramsay sitting down on the bed by her side
1787,she could see the horns cam said all over the room
1788,it was true
1789,wherever they put the light and james could not sleep without a light there was always a shadow somewhere
1790,but think cam it is only an old pig said mrs ramsay a nice black pig like the pigs at the farm
1791,but cam thought it was a horrid thing branching at her all over the room
1792,well then said mrs ramsay we will cover it up and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers and open the little drawers quickly one after another and not seeing anything that would do she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull round and round and round and then she came back to cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside cam own and said how lovely it looked now how the fairies would love it it was like a bird own nest it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes andshe could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in cam own mind and cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain a bird own nest a garden and there were little antelopes and her eyes were opening and shutting and mrs ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously and more rhythmically and more nonsensically how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens and everything lovely she said raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically until she sat upright and saw that cam was asleep
1793,now she whispered crossing over to his bed james must go to sleep too for see she said the boar own skull was still there they had not touched it they had done just what he wanted it was there quite unhurt
1794,he made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl
1795,but he wanted to ask her something more
1796,would they go to the lighthouse tomorrow
1797,no not tomorrow she said but soon she promised him the next fine day
1798,he was very good
1799,he lay down
1800,she covered him up
1801,but he would never forget she knew and she felt angry with charles tansley with her husband and with herself for she had raised his hopes
1802,then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar own skull she got up and pulled the window down another inch or two and heard the wind and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out
1803,she hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads she thought still thinking how annoying charles tansley was
1804,for neither of them slept well they were excitable children and since he said things like that about the lighthouse it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over just as they were going to sleep clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow
1805,for she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work
1806,yet he looked so desolate yet she would feel relieved when he went yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow yet he was admirable with her husband yet his manners certainly wanted improving yet she liked his laugh   ”thinking this as she came downstairs she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window   ”the yellow harvest moon   ” and turned and they saw her standing above them on the stairs
1807,that is my mother thought prue
1808,yes minta should look at her paul rayley should look at her
1809,that is the thing itself she felt as if there were only one person like that in the world her mother
1810,and from having been quite grown up a moment before talking with the others she became a child again and what they had been doing was a game and would her mother sanction their game or condemn it she wondered
1811,and thinking what a chance it was for minta and paul and lily to see her and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her to have her and how she would never grow up and never leave home she said like a child we thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves
1812,instantly for no reason at all mrs ramsay became like a girl of twenty full of gaiety
1813,a mood of revelry suddenly took possession of her
1814,of course they must go of course they must go she cried laughing and running down the last three or four steps quickly she began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing minta own wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too and would they be very late and had any of them got a watch
1815,yes paul has said minta
1816,paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out of a little wash leather case to show her
1817,and as he held it in the palm of his hand before her he felt she knows all about it i need not say anything
1818,he was saying to her as he showed her the watch I have done it mrs ramsay i owe it all to you
1819,and seeing the gold watch lying in his hand mrs ramsay felt how extraordinarily lucky minta is
1820,she is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash  leather bag
1821,how i wish i could come with you she cried
1822,but she was withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was
1823,of course it was impossible for her to go with them
1824,but she would have liked to go had it not been for the other thing and tickled by the absurdity of her thought how lucky to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she went with a smile on her lips into the other room where her husband sat reading
1825,of course she said to herself coming into the room she had to come here to get something she wanted
1826,first she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp
1827,but she wanted something more though she did not know could not think what it was that she wanted
1828,she looked at her husband taking up her stocking and beginning to knit and saw that he did not want to be interrupted   ” that was clear
1829,he was reading something that moved him very much
1830,he was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion
1831,he was tossing the pages over
1832,he was acting it   ”perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book
1833,she wondered what book it was
1834,oh it was one of old sir walter own she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting
1835,for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above had been saying that people do not read scott any more
1836,then her husband thought that is what they will say of me so he went and got one of those books
1837,and if he came to the conclusion that is true what charles tansley said he would accept it about scott
1838,she could see that he was weighing considering putting this with that as he read
1839,but not about himself
1840,he was always uneasy about himself
1841,that troubled her
1842,he would always be worrying about his own books   ”will they be read are they good why are not they better what do people think of me
1843,not liking to think of him so and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting wondering if the children were laughing at that she twitched the stockings out and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now when the breeze falls settles leaf by leaf into quiet
1844,it did not matter any of it she thought
1845,a great man a great book fame   ”who could tell
1846,she knew nothing about it
1847,but it was his way with him his truthfulness   ”for instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively if only he would speak
1848,she had complete trust in him
1849,and dismissing all this as one passes in diving now a weed now a straw now a bubble she felt again sinking deeper as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking there is something i want   ”something i have come to get and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was with her eyes closed
1850,and she waited a little knitting wondering and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically and as they washed words like little shaded lights one red one blue one yellow lit up in the dark of her mind and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across or to cry out and to be echoed so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book
1851,and all the lives we ever lived
1852,and all the lives to be
1853,are full of trees and changing leaves
1854,she murmured sticking her needles into the stocking
1855,and she opened the book and began reading here and there at random and as she did so she felt that she was climbing backwards upwards shoving her way up under petals that curved over her so that she only knew this is white or this is red
1856,she did not know at first what the words meant at all
1857,steer hither steer your winged pines all beaten mariners
1858,she read and turned the page swinging herself zigzagging this way and that from one line to another as from one branch to another from one red and white flower to another until a little sound roused her   ”her husband slapping his thighs
1859,their eyes met for a second but they did not want to speak to each other
1860,they had nothing to say but something seemed nevertheless to go from him to her
1861,it was the life it was the power of it it was the tremendous humour she knew that made him slap his thighs
1862,do not interrupt me he seemed to be saying do not say anything just sit there
1863,and he went on reading
1864,his lips twitched
1865,it filled him
1866,it fortified him
1867,he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they did not exist at all
1868,but now he felt it did not matter a damn who reached z if thought ran like an alphabet from a to z
1869,somebody would reach it   ”if not he then another
1870,this man own strength and sanity his feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit own cottage made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears
1871,raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott own hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie own drowning and mucklebackit own sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him
1872,well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter
1873,he felt that he had been arguing with somebody and had got the better of him
1874,they could not improve upon that whatever they might say and his own position became more secure
1875,the lovers were fiddlesticks he thought collecting it all in his mind again
1876,that is fiddlesticks that is first rate he thought putting one thing beside another
1877,but he must read it again
1878,he could not remember the whole shape of the thing
1879,he had to keep his judgement in suspense
1880,so he returned to the other thought   ”if young men did not care for this naturally they did not care for him either
1881,one ought not to complain thought mr ramsay trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him
1882,but he was determined he would not bother her again
1883,here he looked at her reading
1884,she looked very peaceful reading
1885,he liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone
1886,the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the english novel and the french novel
1887,mrs ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would she really would but otherwise might she go on sleeping just a little longer just a little longer
1888,she was climbing up those branches this way and that laying hands on one flower and then another
1889,nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
1890,she read and so reading she was ascending she felt on to the top on to the summit
1891,how satisfying
1892,how restful
1893,all the odds and ends of the day stuck to this magnet her mind felt swept felt clean
1894,and then there it was suddenly entire she held it in her hands beautiful and reasonable clear and complete here   ”the sonnet
1895,but she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her
1896,he was smiling at her quizzically as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight but at the same time he was thinking go on reading
1897,you do not look sad now he thought
1898,and he wondered what she was reading and exaggerated her ignorance her simplicity for he liked to think that she was not clever not book learned at all
1899,he wondered if she understood what she was reading
1900,probably not he thought
1901,she was astonishingly beautiful
1902,her beauty seemed to him if that were possible to increase
1903,yet seemd it winter still and you away
1904,as with your shadow i with these did play she finished
1905,well she said echoing his smile dreamily looking up from her book
1906,as with your shadow i with these did play
1907,she murmured putting the book on the table
1908,what had happened she wondered as she took up her knitting since she had seen him alone
1909,she remembered dressing and seeing the moon andrew holding his plate too high at dinner being depressed by something william had said the birds in the trees the sofa on the landing the children being awake charles tansley waking them with his books falling   ”oh no that she had invented and paul having a wash  leather case for his watch
1910,which should she tell him about
1911,they are engaged she said beginning to knit paul and minta
1912,so i guessed he said
1913,there was nothing very much to be said about it
1914,her mind was still going up and down up and down with the poetry he was still feeling very vigorous very forthright after reading about steenie own funeral
1915,so they sat silent
1916,then she became aware that she wanted him to say something
1917,anything anything she thought going on with her knitting
1918,anything will do
1919,how nice it would be to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she said for that was the sort of joke they had together
1920,he snorted
1921,he felt about this engagement as he always felt about any engagement the girl is much too good for that young man
1922,slowly it came into her head why is it then that one wants people to marry
1923,what was the value the meaning of things
1924,every word they said now would be true
1925,do say something she thought wishing only to hear his voice
1926,for the shadow the thing folding them in was beginning she felt to close round her again
1927,say anything she begged looking at him as if for help
1928,he was silent swinging the compass on his watch chain to and fro and thinking of scott own novels and balzac own novels
1929,but through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy for they were drawing together involuntarily coming side by side quite close she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind and he was beginning now that her thoughts took a turn he disliked   ”towards this pessimism as he called it   ”to fidget though he said nothing raising his hand to his forehead twisting a lock of hair letting it fall again
1930,you will not finish that stocking tonight he said pointing to her stocking
1931,that was what she wanted   ”the asperity in his voice reproving her
1932,if he says it is wrong to be pessimistic probably it is wrong she thought the marriage will turn out all right
1933,no she said flattening the stocking out upon her knee i shall not finish it
1934,and what then
1935,for she felt that he was still looking at her but that his look had changed
1936,he wanted something   ”wanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him wanted her to tell him that she loved him
1937,and that no she could not do
1938,he found talking so much easier than she did
1939,he could say things   ”she never could
1940,so naturally it was always he that said the things and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly and would reproach her
1941,a heartless woman he called her she never told him that she loved him
1942,but it was not so   ”it was not so
1943,it was only that she never could say what she felt
1944,was there no crumb on his coat
1945,nothing she could do for him
1946,getting up she stood at the window with the reddish brown stocking in her hands partly to turn away from him partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is   ”the sea at night
1947,but she knew that he had turned his head as she turned he was watching her
1948,she knew that he was thinking you are more beautiful than ever
1949,and she felt herself very beautiful
1950,will you not tell me just for once that you love me
1951,he was thinking that for he was roused what with minta and his book and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the lighthouse
1952,but she could not do it she could not say it
1953,then knowing that he was watching her instead of saying anything she turned holding her stocking and looked at him
1954,and as she looked at him she began to smile for though she had not said a word he knew of course he knew that she loved him
1955,he could not deny it
1956,and smiling she looked out of the window and said thinking to herself nothing on earth can equal this happiness   ”
1957,yes you were right it is going to be wet tomorrow you will not be able to go
1958,and she looked at him smiling
1959,for she had triumphed again
1960,she had not said it yet he knew
1961,well we must wait for the future to show said mr bankes coming in from the terrace
1962,it is almost too dark to see said andrew coming up from the beach
1963,one can hardly tell which is the sea and which is the land said prue
1964,do we leave that light burning said lily as they took their coats off indoors
1965,no said prue not if every one own in
1966,andrew she called back just put out the light in the hall
1967,one by one the lamps were all extinguished except that mr carmichael who liked to lie awake a little reading virgil kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest
1968,so with the lamps all put out the moon sunk and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began
1969,nothing it seemed could survive the flood the profusion of darkness which creeping in at keyholes and crevices stole round window blinds came into bedrooms swallowed up here a jug and basin there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers
1970,not only was furniture confounded there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by which one could say this is he or this is she
1971,sometimes a hand was raised as if to clutch something or ward off something or somebody groaned or somebody laughed aloud as if sharing a joke with nothingness
1972,nothing stirred in the drawing room or in the dining room or on the staircase
1973,only through the rusty hinges and swollen sea moistened woodwork certain airs detached from the body of the wind the house was ramshackle after all crept round corners and ventured indoors
1974,almost one might imagine them as they entered the drawing room questioning and wondering toying with the flap of hanging wall paper asking would it hang much longer when would it fall
1975,then smoothly brushing the walls they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall paper whether they would fade and questioning gently for there was time at their disposal the torn letters in the wastepaper basket the flowers the books all of which were now open to them and asking were they allies
1976,were they enemies
1977,how long would they endure
1978,so some random light directing them with its pale footfall upon stair and mat from some uncovered star or wandering ship or the lighthouse even with its pale footfall upon stair and mat the little airs mounted the staircase and nosed round bedroom doors
1979,but here surely they must cease
1980,whatever else may perish and disappear what lies here is steadfast
1981,here one might say to those sliding lights those fumbling airs that breathe and bend over the bed itself here you can neither touch nor destroy
1982,upon which wearily ghostlily as if they had feather light fingers and the light persistency of feathers they would look once on the shut eyes and the loosely clasping fingers and fold their garments wearily and disappear
1983,and so nosing rubbing they went to the window on the staircase to the servants bedrooms to the boxes in the attics descending blanched the apples on the dining room table fumbled the petals of roses tried the picture on the easel brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor
1984,at length desisting all ceased together gathered together all sighed together all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to which some door in the kitchen replied swung wide admitted nothing and slammed to
1985,here mr carmichael who was reading virgil blew out his candle
1986,it was past midnight
1987,but what after all is one night
1988,a short space especially when the darkness dims so soon and so soon a bird sings a cock crows or a faint green quickens like a turning leaf in the hollow of the wave
1989,night however succeeds to night
1990,the winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally evenly with indefatigable fingers
1991,they lengthen they darken
1992,some of them hold aloft clear planets plates of brightness
1993,the autumn trees ravaged as they are take on the flash of tattered flags kindling in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in indian sands
1994,the autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight in the light of harvest moons the light which mellows the energy of labour and smooths the stubble and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore
1995,it seemed now as if touched by human penitence and all its toil divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it single distinct the hare erect the wave falling the boat rocking which did we deserve them should be ours always
1996,but alas divine goodness twitching the cord draws the curtain it does not please him he covers his treasures in a drench of hail and so breaks them so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth
1997,for our penitence deserves a glimpse only our toil respite only
1998,the nights now are full of wind and destruction the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths
1999,also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts a sharer of his solitude throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul
2000,the hand dwindles in his hand the voice bellows in his ear
2001,almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what and why and wherefore which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer
2002,mr ramsay stumbling along a passage one dark morning stretched his arms out but mrs ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before his arms though stretched out remained empty
2003,so with the house empty and the doors locked and the mattresses rolled round those stray airs advance guards of great armies blustered in brushed bare boards nibbled and fanned met nothing in bedroom or drawing room that wholly resisted them but only hangings that flapped wood that creaked the bare legs of tables saucepans and china already furred tarnished cracked
2004,what people had she would and left   ”a pair of shoes a shooting cap some faded skirts and coats in wardrobes   ”those alone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons how once the looking glass had held a face had held a world hollowed out in which a figure turned a hand flashed the door opened in came children rushing and tumbling and went out again
2005,now day after day light turned like a flower reflected in water its sharp image on the wall opposite
2006,only the shadows of the trees flourishing in the wind made obeisance on the wall and for a moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself or birds flying made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor
2007,so loveliness reigned and stillness and together made the shape of loveliness itself a form from which life had parted solitary like a pool at evening far distant seen from a train window vanishing so quickly that the pool pale in the evening is scarcely robbed of its solitude though once seen
2008,loveliness and stillness clasped hands in the bedroom and among the shrouded jugs and sheeted chairs even the prying of the wind and the soft nose of the clammy sea airs rubbing snuffling iterating and reiterating their questions   ”will you fade will you perish   ”scarcely disturbed the peace the indifference the air of pure integrity as if the question they asked scarcely needed that they should answer we remain
2009,nothing it seemed could break that image corrupt that innocence or disturb the swaying mantle of silence which week after week in the empty room wove into itself the falling cries of birds ships hooting the drone and hum of the fields a dog own bark a man own shout and folded them round the house in silence
2010,once only a board sprang on the landing once in the middle of the night with a roar with a rupture as after centuries of quiescence a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley one fold of the shawl loosened and swung to and fro
2011,then again peace descended and the shadow wavered light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall and mrs mcnab tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood in the wash tub grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle came as directed to open all windows and dust the bedrooms
2012,as she lurched for she rolled like a ship at sea and leered for her eyes fell on nothing directly but with a sidelong glance that deprecated the scorn and anger of the world   ”she was witless she knew it as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself upstairs and rolled from room to room she sang
2013,rubbing the glass of the long looking glass and leering sideways at her swinging figure a sound issued from her lips   ”something that had been gay twenty years before on the stage perhaps had been hummed and danced to but now coming from the toothless bonneted care taking woman was robbed of meaning was like the voice of witlessness humour persistency itself trodden down but springing up again so that as she lurched dusting wiping she seemed to say how it was one long sorrow and trouble how it was getting up and going to bed again and bringing things out and putting them away again
2014,it was not easy or snug this world she had known for close on seventy years
2015,bowed down she was with weariness
2016,how long she asked creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed dusting the boards how long shall it endure
2017,but hobbled to her feet again pulled herself up and again with her sidelong leer which slipped and turned aside even from her own face and her own sorrows stood and gaped in the glass aimlessly smiling and began again the old amble and hobble taking up mats putting down china looking sideways in the glass as if after all she had her consolations as if indeed there twined about her dirge some incorrigible hope
2018,visions of joy there must have been at the wash  tub say with her children yet two had been base born and one had deserted her at the public house drinking turning over scraps in her drawers
2019,some cleavage of the dark there must have been some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her turning to her job again mumble out the old music hall song
2020,the mystic the visionary walking the beach on a fine night stirring a puddle looking at a stone asking themselves what am i what is this had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them they could not say what it was so that they were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert
2021,but mrs mcnab continued to drink and gossip as before
2022,the spring without a leaf to toss bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity scornful in her purity was laid out on fields wide  eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by the beholders
2023,prue ramsay leaning on her father own arm was given in marriage
2024,what people said could have been more fitting
2025,and they added how beautiful she looked
2026,as summer neared as the evenings lengthened there came to the wakeful the hopeful walking the beach stirring the pool imaginations of the strangest kind   ”of flesh turned to atoms which drove before the wind of stars flashing in their hearts of cliff sea cloud and sky brought purposely together to assemble outwardly the scattered parts of the vision within
2027,in those mirrors the minds of men in those pools of uneasy water in which clouds for ever turn and shadows form dreams persisted and it was impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull flower tree man and woman and the white earth itself seemed to declare but if questioned at once to withdraw that good triumphs happiness prevails order rules or to resist the extraordinary stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute good some crystal of intensity remote from the known pleasures and familiar virtues something alien to the processes of domestic life single hard bright like a diamond in the sand which would render the possessor secure
2028,moreover softened and acquiescent the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak about her veiled her eyes averted her head and among passing shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of the sorrows of mankind
2029,prue ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth which was indeed a tragedy people said everything they said had promised so well
2030,and now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house again
2031,flies wove a web in the sunny rooms weeds that had grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane
2032,when darkness fell the stroke of the lighthouse which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness tracing its pattern came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again
2033,but in the very lull of this loving caress as the long stroke leant upon the bed the rock was rent asunder another fold of the shawl loosened there it hung and swayed
2034,through the short summer nights and the long summer days when the empty rooms seemed to murmur with the echoes of the fields and the hum of flies the long streamer waved gently swayed aimlessly while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that mrs mcnab when she broke in and lurched about dusting sweeping looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun lanced waters
2035,but slumber and sleep though it might there came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of hammers dulled on felt which with their repeated shocks still further loosened the shawl and cracked the tea cups
2036,now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too
2037,then again silence fell and then night after night and sometimes in plain mid day when the roses were bright and light turned on the wall its shape clearly there seemed to drop into this silence this indifference this integrity the thud of something falling
2038,a she will exploded
2039,twenty or thirty young men were blown up in france among them andrew ramsay whose death mercifully was instantaneous
2040,at that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask of the sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they affirmed had to consider among the usual tokens of divine bounty   ”the sunset on the sea the pallor of dawn the moon rising fishing boats against the moon and children making mud pies or pelting each other with handfuls of grass something out of harmony with this jocundity and this serenity
2041,there was the silent apparition of an ashen coloured ship for instance come gone there was a purplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if something had boiled and bled invisibly beneath
2042,this intrusion into a scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the most comfortable conclusions stayed their pacing
2043,it was difficult blandly to overlook them to abolish their significance in the landscape to continue as one walked by the sea to marvel how beauty outside mirrored beauty within
2044,did nature supplement what man advanced
2045,did she complete what he began
2046,with equal complacence she saw his misery his meanness and his torture
2047,that dream of sharing completing of finding in solitude on the beach an answer was then but a reflection in a mirror and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath
2048,impatient despairing yet loth to go for beauty offers her lures has her consolations to pace the beach was impossible contemplation was unendurable the mirror was broken
2049,mr carmichael brought out a volume of poems that spring which had an unexpected success
2050,the war people said had revived their interest in poetry
2051,night after night summer and winter the torment of storms the arrow  like stillness of fine had there been any one to listen from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing as the winds and waves disported themselves like the amorphous bulks of leviathans whose brows are pierced by no light of reason and mounted one on top of another and lunged and plunged in the darkness or the daylight for night and day month and year ran shapelessly together in idiot games until it seemed as if the universe were battling and tumbling in brute confusion and wanton lust aimlessly by itself
2052,in spring the garden urns casually filled with wind blown plants were gay as ever
2053,violets came and daffodils
2054,but the stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night with the trees standing there and the flowers standing there looking before them looking up yet beholding nothing eyeless and so terrible
2055,thinking no harm for the family would not come never again some said and the house would be sold at michaelmas perhaps mrs mcnab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her
2056,she laid them on the table while she dusted
2057,she was fond of flowers
2058,it was a pity to let them waste
2059,suppose the house were sold she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking glass it would want seeing to   ”it would
2060,there it had stood all these years without a soul in it
2061,the books and things were mouldy for what with the war and help being hard to get the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished
2062,it was beyond one person own strength to get it straight now
2063,she was too old
2064,her legs pained her
2065,all those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun there was plaster fallen in the hall the rain pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in the carpet was ruined quite
2066,but people should come themselves they should have sent somebody down to see
2067,for there were clothes in the cupboards they had left clothes in all the bedrooms
2068,what was she to do with them
2069,they had the moth in them   ”mrs
2070,ramsay own things
2071,poor lady
2072,she would never want them again
2073,she was dead they said years ago in london
2074,there was the old grey cloak she wore gardening mrs mcnab fingered it
2075,she could see her as she came up the drive with the washing stooping over her flowers the garden was a pitiful sight now all run to riot and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds   ”she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak
2076,there were boots and shoes and a brush and comb left on the dressing table for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow
2077,she had died very sudden at the end they said
2078,and once they had been coming but had put off coming what with the war and travel being so difficult these days they had never come all these years just sent her money but never wrote never came and expected to find things as they had left them ah dear
2079,why the dressing table drawers were full of things she pulled them open handkerchiefs bits of ribbon
2080,yes she could see mrs ramsay as she came up the drive with the washing
2081,good evening mrs mcnab she would say
2082,she had a pleasant way with her
2083,the girls all liked her
2084,but dear many things had changed since then she shut the drawer many families had lost their dearest
2085,so she was dead and mr andrew killed and miss prue dead too they said with her first baby but everyone had lost some one these years
2086,prices had gone up shamefully and did not come down again neither
2087,she could well remember her in her grey cloak
2088,good evening mrs mcnab she said and told cook to keep a plate of milk soup for her   ”quite thought she wanted it carrying that heavy basket all the way up from town
2089,she could see her now stooping over her flowers and faint and flickering like a yellow beam or the circle at the end of a telescope a lady in a grey cloak stooping over her flowers went wandering over the bedroom wall up the dressing table across the wash stand as mrs mcnab hobbled and ambled dusting straightening
2090,and cook own name now
2091,mildred
2092,marian
2093,  ”some name like that
2094,ah she had forgotten   ”she did forget things
2095,fiery like all red haired women
2096,many a laugh they had had
2097,she was always welcome in the kitchen
2098,she made them laugh she did
2099,things were better then than now
2100,she sighed there was too much work for one woman
2101,she wagged her head this side and that
2102,this had been the nursery
2103,why it was all damp in here the plaster was falling
2104,whatever did they want to hang a beast own skull there
2105,gone mouldy too
2106,and rats in all the attics
2107,the rain came in
2108,but they never sent never came
2109,some of the locks had gone so the doors banged
2110,she did not like to be up here at dusk alone neither
2111,it was too much for one woman too much too much
2112,she creaked she moaned
2113,she banged the door
2114,she turned the key in the lock and left the house alone shut up locked
2115,the house was left the house was deserted
2116,it was left like a she will on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it
2117,the long night seemed to have set in the trifling airs nibbling the clammy breaths fumbling seemed to have triumphed
2118,the saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed
2119,toads had nosed their way in
2120,idly aimlessly the swaying shawl swung to and fro
2121,a thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder
2122,the swallows nested in the drawing  roon the floor was strewn with straw the plaster fell in shovelfuls rafters were laid bare rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots
2123,tortoise she will butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window pane
2124,poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias the lawn waved with long grass giant artichokes towered among roses a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become on winters nights a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole room green in summer
2125,what power could now prevent the fertility the insensibility of nature
2126,mrs mcnab own dream of a lady of a child of a plate of milk soup
2127,it had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished
2128,she had locked the door she had gone
2129,it was beyond the strength of one woman she said
2130,they never sent
2131,they never wrote
2132,there were things up there rotting in the drawers   ”it was a shame to leave them so she said
2133,the place was gone to rack and ruin
2134,only the lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow the rat and the straw
2135,nothing now withstood them nothing said no to them
2136,let the wind blow let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage
2137,let the swallow build in the drawing room and the thistle thrust aside the tiles and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the arm chairs
2138,let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries
2139,for now had come that moment that hesitation when dawn trembles and night pauses when if a feather alight in the scale it will be weighed down
2140,one feather and the house sinking falling would have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness
2141,in the ruined room picnickers would have lit their kettles lovers sought shelter there lying on the bare boards and the shepherd stored his dinner on the bricks and the tramp slept with his coat round him to ward off the cold
2142,then the roof would have fallen briars and hemlocks would have blotted out path step and window would have grown unequally but lustily over the mound until some trespasser losing his way could have told only by a red hot poker among the nettles or a scrap of china in the hemlock that here once some one had lived there had been a house
2143,if the feather had fallen if it had tipped the scale downwards the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of oblivion
2144,but there was a force working something not highly conscious something that leered something that lurched something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting
2145,mrs mcnab groaned mrs bast creaked
2146,they were old they were stiff their legs ached
2147,they came with their brooms and pails at last they got to work
2148,all of a sudden would mrs mcnab see that the house was ready one of the young ladies wrote would she get this done would she get that done all in a hurry
2149,they might be coming for the summer had left everything to the last expected to find things as they had left them
2150,slowly and painfully with broom and pail mopping scouring mrs mcnab mrs bast stayed the corruption and the rot rescued from the pool of time that was fast closing over them now a basin now a cupboard fetched up from oblivion all the waverley novels and a tea set one morning in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender and a set of steel fire irons
2151,george mrs bast own son caught the rats and cut the grass
2152,they had the builders
2153,attended with the creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts the slamming and banging of damp swollen woodwork some rusty laborious birth seemed to be taking place as the women stooping rising groaning singing slapped and slammed upstairs now now down in the cellars
2154,oh they said the work
2155,they drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes or in the study breaking off work at mid day with the smudge on their faces and their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles
2156,flopped on chairs they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and bath now the more arduous more partial triumph over long rows of books black as ravens once now white stained breeding pale mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders
2157,once more as she felt the tea warm in her the telescope fitted itself to mrs mcnab own eyes and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman lean as a rake wagging his head as she came up with the washing talking to himself she supposed on the lawn
2158,he never noticed her
2159,some said he was dead some said she was dead
2160,which was it
2161,mrs bast did not know for certain either
2162,the young gentleman was dead
2163,that she was sure
2164,she had read his name in the papers
2165,there was the cook now mildred marian some such name as that   ”a red  headed woman quick tempered like all her sort but kind too if you knew the way with her
2166,many a laugh they had had together
2167,she saved a plate of soup for maggie a bite of ham sometimes whatever was over
2168,they lived well in those days
2169,they had everything they wanted glibly jovially with the tea hot in her she unwound her ball of memories sitting in the wicker arm chair by the nursery fender
2170,there was always plenty doing people in the house twenty staying sometimes and washing up till long past midnight
2171,mrs bast she had never known them had lived in glasgow at that time wondered putting her cup down whatever they hung that beast own skull there for
2172,shot in foreign parts no doubt
2173,it might well be said mrs mcnab wantoning on with her memories they had friends in eastern countries gentlemen staying there ladies in evening dress she had seen them once through the dining room door all sitting at dinner
2174,twenty she dared say all in their jewellery and she asked to stay help wash up might be till after midnight
2175,ah said mrs bast they would find it changed
2176,she leant out of the window
2177,she watched her son george scything the grass
2178,they might well ask what had been done to it
2179,seeing how old kennedy was supposed to have charge of it and then his leg got so bad after he fell from the cart and perhaps then no one for a year or the better part of one and then davie macdonald and seeds might be sent but who should say if they were ever planted
2180,they would find it changed
2181,she watched her son scything
2182,he was a great one for work   ”one of those quiet ones
2183,well they must be getting along with the cupboards she supposed
2184,they hauled themselves up
2185,at last after days of labour within of cutting and digging without dusters were flicked from the windows the windows were shut to keys were turned all over the house the front door was banged it was finished
2186,and now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half heard melody that intermittent music which the ear half catches but let us fall a bark a bleat irregular intermittent yet somehow related the hum of an insect the tremor of cut grass disevered yet somehow belonging the jar of a dorbeetle the squeak of a wheel loud low but mysteriously related which the ear strains to bring together and is always on the verge of harmonising but they are never quite heard never fully harmonised and at last in the evening one after another the sounds die out and the harmony falters and silence falls
2187,with the sunset sharpness was lost and like mist rising quiet rose quiet spread the wind settled loosely the world shook itself down to sleep darkly here without a light to it save what came green suffused through leaves or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window
2188,lily briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one evening in september
2189,mr carmichael came by the same train
2190,then indeed peace had come
2191,messages of peace breathed from the sea to the shore
2192,never to break its sleep any more to lull it rather more deeply to rest and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily dreamt wisely to confirm   ”what else was it murmuring   ”as lily briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room and heard the sea
2193,through the open window the voice of the beauty of the world came murmuring too softly to hear exactly what it said   ”but what mattered if the meaning were plain
2194,entreating the sleepers the house was full again mrs beckwith was staying there also mr carmichael if they would not actually come down to the beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out
2195,they would see then night flowing down in purple his head crowned his sceptre jewelled and how in his eyes a child might look
2196,and if they still faltered lily was tired out with travelling and slept almost at once but mr carmichael read a book by candlelight if they still said no that it was vapour this splendour of his and the dew had more power than he and they preferred sleeping gently then without complaint or argument the voice would sing its song
2197,gently the waves would break lily heard them in her sleep tenderly the light fell it seemed to come through her eyelids
2198,and it all looked mr carmichael thought shutting his book falling asleep much as it used to look
2199,indeed the voice might resume as the curtains of dark wrapped themselves over the house over mrs beckwith mr carmichael and lily briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on their eyes why not accept this be content with this acquiesce and resign
2200,the sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the isles soothed them the night wrapped them nothing broke their sleep until the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin voices in to its whiteness a cart grinding a dog somewhere barking the sun lifted the curtains broke the veil on their eyes and lily briscoe stirring in her sleep
2201,she clutched at her blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff
2202,her eyes opened wide
2203,here she was again she thought sitting bold upright in bed
2204,awake
2205,what does it mean then what can it all mean
2206,lily briscoe asked herself wondering whether since she had been left alone it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here
2207,what does it mean
2208,  ”a catchword that was caught up from some book fitting her thought loosely for she could not this first morning with the ramsays contract her feelings could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk
2209,for really what did she feel come back after all these years and mrs ramsay dead
2210,nothing nothing   ”nothing that she could express at all
2211,she had come late last night when it was all mysterious dark
2212,now she was awake at her old place at the breakfast table but alone
2213,it was very early too not yet eight
2214,there was this expedition   ”they were going to the lighthouse mr ramsay cam and james
2215,they should have gone already   ”they had to catch the tide or something
2216,and cam was not ready and james was not ready and nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and mr ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room
2217,what is the use of going now he had stormed
2218,nancy had vanished
2219,there he was marching up and down the terrace in a rage
2220,one seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house
2221,now nancy burst in and asked looking round the room in a queer half dazed half desperate way what does one send to the lighthouse as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do
2222,what does one send to the lighthouse indeed
2223,at any other time lily could have suggested reasonably tea tobacco newspapers
2224,but this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like nancy own   ”what does one send to the lighthouse
2225,  ”opened doors in one own mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking in a stupefied gape what does one send
2226,what does one do
2227,why is one sitting here after all
2228,sitting alone for nancy went out again among the clean cups at the long table she felt cut off from other people and able only to go on watching asking wondering
2229,the house the place the morning all seemed strangers to her
2230,she had no attachment here she felt no relations with it anything might happen and whatever did happen a step outside a voice calling it is not in the cupboard it is on the landing some one cried was a question as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut and they floated up here down there off anyhow
2231,how aimless it was how chaotic how unreal it was she thought looking at her empty coffee cup
2232,mrs ramsay dead andrew killed prue dead too   ”repeat it as she might it roused no feeling in her
2233,and we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this she said looking out of the window
2234,it was a beautiful still day
2235,suddenly mr ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating as if he saw you for one second for the first time for ever and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him   ”to escape his demand on her to put aside a moment longer that imperious need
2236,and he shook his head at her and strode on alone she heard him say perished she heard him say and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols wrote themselves all over the grey green walls
2237,if only she could put them together she felt write them out in some sentence then she would have got at the truth of things
2238,old mr carmichael came padding softly in fetched his coffee took his cup and made off to sit in the sun
2239,the extraordinary unreality was frightening but it was also exciting
2240,going to the lighthouse
2241,but what does one send to the lighthouse
2242,perished
2243,alone
2244,the grey green light on the wall opposite
2245,the empty places
2246,such were some of the parts but how bring them together
2247,she asked
2248,as if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest mr ramsay should see her
2249,she must escape somewhere be alone somewhere
2250,suddenly she remembered
2251,when she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table cloth which she had looked at in a moment of revelation
2252,there had been a problem about a foreground of a picture
2253,move the tree to the middle she had said
2254,she had never finished that picture
2255,she would paint that picture now
2256,it had been knocking about in her mind all these years
2257,where were her paints she wondered
2258,her paints yes
2259,she had left them in the hall last night
2260,she would start at once
2261,she got up quickly before mr ramsay turned
2262,she fetched herself a chair
2263,she pitched her easel with her precise old maidish movements on the edge of the lawn not too close to mr carmichael but close enough for his protection
2264,yes it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago
2265,there was the wall the hedge the tree
2266,the question was of some relation between those masses
2267,she had borne it in her mind all these years
2268,it seemed as if the solution had come to her she knew now what she wanted to do
2269,but with mr ramsay bearing down on her she could do nothing
2270,every time he approached   ”he was walking up and down the terrace   ”ruin approached chaos approached
2271,she could not paint
2272,she stooped she turned she took up this rag she squeezed that tube
2273,but all she did was to ward him off a moment
2274,he made it impossible for her to do anything
2275,for if she gave him the least chance if he saw her disengaged a moment looking his way a moment he would be on her saying as he had said last night you find us much changed
2276,last night he had got up and stopped before her and said that
2277,dumb and staring though they had all sat the six children whom they used to call after the kings and queens of england   ”the red the fair the wicked the ruthless   ”she felt how they raged under it
2278,kind old mrs beckwith said something sensible
2279,but it was a house full of unrelated passions   ”she had felt that all the evening
2280,and on top of this chaos mr ramsay got up pressed her hand and said you will find us much changed and none of them had moved or had spoken but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it
2281,only james certainly the sullen scowled at the lamp and cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger
2282,then he reminded them that they were going to the lighthouse tomorrow
2283,they must be ready in the hall on the stroke of half past seven
2284,then with his hand on the door he stopped he turned upon them
2285,did they not want to go
2286,he demanded
2287,had they dared say no he had some reason for wanting it he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair
2288,such a gift he had for gesture
2289,he looked like a king in exile
2290,doggedly james said yes
2291,cam stumbled more wretchedly
2292,yes oh yes they would both be ready they said
2293,and it struck her this was tragedy   ”not palls dust and the shroud but children coerced their spirits subdued
2294,james was sixteen cam seventeen perhaps
2295,she had looked round for some one who was not there for mrs ramsay presumably
2296,but there was only kind mrs beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp
2297,then being tired her mind still rising and falling with the sea the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her the candles wavering in her eyes she had lost herself and gone under
2298,it was a wonderful night starlit the waves sounded as they went upstairs the moon surprised them enormous pale as they passed the staircase window
2299,she had slept at once
2300,she set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel as a barrier frail but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off mr ramsay and his exactingness
2301,she did her best to look when his back was turned at her picture that line there that mass there
2302,but it was out of the question
2303,let him be fifty feet away let him not even speak to you let him not even see you he permeated he prevailed he imposed himself
2304,he changed everything
2305,she could not see the colour she could not see the lines even with his back turned to her she could only think but he will be down on me in a moment demanding   ”something she felt she could not give him
2306,she rejected one brush she chose another
2307,when would those children come
2308,when would they all be off
2309,she fidgeted
2310,that man she thought her anger rising in her never gave that man took
2311,she on the other hand would be forced to give
2312,mrs ramsay had given
2313,giving giving giving she had died   ”and had left all this
2314,really she was angry with mrs ramsay
2315,with the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge the step the wall
2316,it was all mrs ramsay own doing
2317,she was dead
2318,here was lily at forty four wasting her time unable to do a thing standing there playing at painting playing at the one thing one did not play at and it was all mrs ramsay own fault
2319,she was dead
2320,the step where she used to sit was empty
2321,she was dead
2322,but why repeat this over and over again
2323,why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got
2324,there was a kind of blasphemy in it
2325,it was all dry all withered all spent
2326,they ought not to have asked her she ought not to have come
2327,one cannot waste one own time at forty  four she thought
2328,she hated playing at painting
2329,a brush the one dependable thing in a world of strife ruin chaos   ”that one should not play with knowingly even she detested it
2330,but he made her
2331,you shall not touch your canvas he seemed to say bearing down on her till you have given me what i want of you
2332,here he was close upon her again greedy distraught
2333,well thought lily in despair letting her right hand fall at her side it would be simpler then to have it over
2334,surely she could imitate from recollection the glow the rhapsody the self surrender she had seen on so many women own faces on mrs ramsay own for instance when on some occasion like this they blazed up   ”she could remember the look on mrs ramsay own face   ”into a rapture of sympathy of delight in the reward they had which though the reason of it escaped her evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable
2335,here he was stopped by her side
2336,she would give him what she could
2337,she seemed to have shrivelled slightly he thought
2338,she looked a little skimpy wispy but not unattractive
2339,he liked her
2340,there had been some talk of her marrying william bankes once but nothing had come of it
2341,his wife had been fond of her
2342,he had been a little out of temper too at breakfast
2343,and then and then   ”this was one of those moments when an enormous need urged him without being conscious what it was to approach any woman to force them he did not care how his need was so great to give him what he wanted sympathy
2344,was anybody looking after her
2345,he said
2346,had she everything she wanted
2347,oh thanks everything said lily briscoe nervously
2348,no she could not do it
2349,she ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of sympathetic expansion the pressure on her was tremendous
2350,but she remained stuck
2351,there was an awful pause
2352,they both looked at the sea
2353,why thought mr ramsay should she look at the sea when i am here
2354,she hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the lighthouse she said
2355,the lighthouse
2356,the lighthouse
2357,what is that got to do with it
2358,he thought impatiently
2359,instantly with the force of some primeval gust for really he could not restrain himself any longer there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something said something   ”all except myself thought lily girding at herself bitterly who am not a woman but a peevish ill tempered dried up old maid presumably
2360,mr ramsay sighed to the full
2361,he waited
2362,was she not going to say anything
2363,did she not see what he wanted from her
2364,then he said he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the lighthouse
2365,his wife used to send the men things
2366,there was a poor boy with a tuberculous hip the lightkeeper own son
2367,he sighed profoundly
2368,he sighed significantly
2369,all lily wished was that this enormous flood of grief this insatiable hunger for sympathy this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely and even so he had sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever should leave her should be diverted she kept looking at the house hoping for an interruption before it swept her down in its flow
2370,such expeditions said mr ramsay scraping the ground with his toe are very painful
2371,still lily said nothing
2372,she is a stock she is a stone he said to himself they are very exhausting he said looking with a sickly look that nauseated her he was acting she felt this great man was dramatising himself at his beautiful hands
2373,it was horrible it was indecent
2374,would they never come she asked for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow support these heavy draperies of grief he had assumed a pose of extreme decreptitude he even tottered a little as he stood there a moment longer
2375,still she could say nothing the whole horizon seemed swept bare of objects to talk about could only feel amazedly as mr ramsay stood there how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and discolour it and cast over the rubicund drowsy entirely contented figure of mr carmichael reading a french novel on a deck chair a veil of crape as if such an existence flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all
2376,look at him he seemed to be saying look at me and indeed all the time he was feeling think of me think of me
2377,ah could that bulk only be wafted alongside of them lily wished had she only pitched her easel a yard or two closer to him a man any man would staunch this effusion would stop these lamentations
2378,a woman she had provoked this horror a woman she should have known how to deal with it
2379,it was immensely to her discredit sexually to stand there dumb
2380,one said   ”what did one say
2381,  ”oh mr ramsay
2382,dear mr ramsay
2383,that was what that kind old lady who sketched mrs beckwith would have said instantly and rightly
2384,but no
2385,they stood there isolated from the rest of the world
2386,his immense self pity his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at ther feet and all she did miserable sinner that she was was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles lest she should get wet
2387,in complete silence she stood there grasping her paint brush
2388,heaven could never be sufficiently praised
2389,she heard sounds in the house
2390,james and cam must be coming
2391,but mr ramsay as if he knew that his time ran short exerted upon her solitary figure the immense pressure of his concentrated woe his age his frailty his desolation when suddenly tossing his head impatiently in his annoyance   ”for after all what woman could resist him
2392,  ”he noticed that his boot laces were untied
2393,remarkable boots they were too lily thought looking down at them sculptured colossal like everything that mr ramsay wore from his frayed tie to his half buttoned waistcoat his own indisputably
2394,she could see them walking to his room of their own accord expressive in his absence of pathos surliness ill temper charm
2395,what beautiful boots she exclaimed
2396,she was ashamed of herself
2397,to praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul when he had shown her his bleeding hands his lacerated heart and asked her to pity them then to say cheerfully ah but what beautiful boots you wear deserved she knew and she looked up expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill temper complete annihilation
2398,instead mr ramsay smiled
2399,his pall his draperies his infirmities fell from him
2400,ah yes he said holding his foot up for her to look at they were first rate boots
2401,there was only one man in england who could make boots like that
2402,boots are among the chief curses of mankind he said
2403,bootmakers make it their business he exclaimed to cripple and torture the human foot
2404,they are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind
2405,it had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made
2406,he would have her observe he lifted his right foot and then his left that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before
2407,they were made of the finest leather in the world also
2408,most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard
2409,he looked complacently at his foot still held in the air
2410,they had reached she felt a sunny island where peace dwelt sanity reigned and the sun for ever shone the blessed island of good boots
2411,her heart warmed to him
2412,now let me see if you can tie a knot he said
2413,he poohpoohed her feeble system
2414,he showed her his own invention
2415,once you tied it it never came undone
2416,three times he knotted her shoe three times he unknotted it
2417,why at this completely inappropriate moment when he was stooping over her shoe should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that as she stooped too the blood rushed to her face and thinking of her callousness she had called him a play actor she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears
2418,thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos
2419,he tied knots
2420,he bought boots
2421,there was no helping mr ramsay on the journey he was going
2422,but now just as she wished to say something could have said something perhaps here they were   ”cam and james
2423,they appeared on the terrace
2424,they came lagging side by side a serious melancholy couple
2425,but why was it like that that they came
2426,she could not help feeling annoyed with them they might have come more cheerfully they might have given him what now that they were off she would not have the chance of giving him
2427,for she felt a sudden emptiness a frustration
2428,her feeling had come too late there it was ready but he no longer needed it
2429,he had become a very distinguished elderly man who had no need of her whatsoever
2430,she felt snubbed
2431,he slung a knapsack round his shoulders
2432,he shared out the parcels   ”there were a number of them ill tied in brown paper
2433,he sent cam for a cloak
2434,he had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition
2435,then wheeling about he led the way with his firm military tread in those wonderful boots carrying brown paper parcels down the path his children following him
2436,they looked she thought as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise and they went to it still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father own wake obediently but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence
2437,so they passed the edge of the lawn and it seemed to lily that she watched a procession go drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it faltering and flagging as it was a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her
2438,politely but very distantly mr ramsay raised his hand and saluted her as they passed
2439,but what a face she thought immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression
2440,what had made it like that
2441,thinking night after night she supposed   ”about the reality of kitchen tables she added remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what mr ramsay did think about andrew had given her
2442,he had been killed by the splinter of a she will instantly she bethought her
2443,the kitchen table was something visionary austere something bare hard not ornamental
2444,there was no colour to it it was all edges and angles it was uncompromisingly plain
2445,but mr ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her
2446,then she recalled standing where he had left her holding her brush worries had fretted it   ”not so nobly
2447,he must have had his doubts about that table she supposed whether the table was a real table whether it was worth the time he gave to it whether he was able after all to find it
2448,he had had doubts she felt or he would have asked less of people
2449,that was what they talked about late at night sometimes she suspected and then next day mrs ramsay looked tired and lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing
2450,but now he had nobody to talk to about that table or his boots or his knots and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour and his face had that touch of desperation of exaggeration in it which alarmed her and made her pull her skirts about her
2451,and then she recalled there was that sudden revivification that sudden flare when she praised his boots that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things which too passed and changed for he was always changing and hid nothing into that other final phase which was new to her and had she owned made herself ashamed of her own irritability when it seemed as if he had she would worries and ambitions and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise had entered some other region was drawn on as if by curiosity in dumb colloquy whether with himself or another at the head of that little procession out of one own range
2452,an extraordinary face
2453,the gate banged
2454,so they are gone she thought sighing with relief and disappointment
2455,her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her like a bramble sprung across her face
2456,she felt curiously divided as if one part of her were drawn out there   ”it was a still day hazy the lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance the other had fixed itself doggedly solidly here on the lawn
2457,she saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her
2458,it seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation this folly and waste of emotion it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a peace as her disorderly sensations he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing trooped off the field and then emptiness
2459,she looked blankly at the canvas with its uncompromising white stare from the canvas to the garden
2460,there was something she stood screwing up her little chinese eyes in her small puckered face something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across slicing down and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns which had stayed in her mind which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time involuntarily as she walked along the brompton road as she brushed her hair she found herself painting that picture passing her eye over it and untying the knot in imagination
2461,but there was all the difference in the world between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush and making the first mark
2462,she had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at mr ramsay own presence and her easel rammed into the earth so nervously was at the wrong angle
2463,and now that she had ut that right and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person had such and such relations to people she took her hand and raised her brush
2464,for a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air
2465,where to begin
2466,  ”that was the question at what point to make the first mark
2467,one line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks to frequent and irrevocable decisions
2468,all that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs and foaming crests
2469,still the risk must be run the mark made
2470,with a curious physical sensation as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back she made her first quick decisive stroke
2471,the brush descended
2472,it flickered brown over the white canvas it left a running mark
2473,a second time she did it   ”a third time
2474,and so pausing and so flickering she attained a dancing rhythmical movement as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another and all were related and so lightly and swiftly pausing striking she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed  she felt it looming out at her a space
2475,down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her
2476,for what could be more formidable than that space
2477,here she was again she thought stepping back to look at it drawn out of gossip out of living out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers   ”this other thing this truth this reality which suddenly laid hands on her emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention
2478,she was half unwilling half reluctant
2479,why always be drawn out and haled away
2480,why not left in peace to talk to mr carmichael on the lawn
2481,it was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow
2482,other worshipful objects were content with worship men women god all let one kneel prostrate but this form were it only the shape of a white lamp shade looming on a wicker table roused one to perpetual combat challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted
2483,always it was in her nature or in her sex she did not know which before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul a soul reft of body hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt
2484,why then did she do it
2485,she looked at the canvas lightly scored with running lines
2486,it would be hung in the servants bedrooms
2487,it would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa
2488,what was the good of doing it then and she heard some voice saying she could not paint saying she could not create as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them
2489,cannot paint cannot write she murmured monotonously anxiously considering what her plan of attack should be
2490,for the mass loomed before her it protruded she felt it pressing on her eyeballs
2491,then as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers moving her brush hither and thither but it was now heavier and went slower as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her she kept looking at the hedge at the canvas by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current
2492,certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things
2493,and as she lost consciousness of outer things and her name and her personality and her appearance and whether mr carmichael was there or not her mind kept throwing up from its depths scenes and names and sayings and memories and ideas like a fountain spurting over that glaring hideously difficult white space while she modelled it with greens and blues
2494,charles tansley used to say that she remembered women cannot paint cannot write
2495,coming up behind her he had stood close beside her a thing she hated as she painted her on this very spot
2496,shag tobacco he said fivepence an ounce parading his poverty his principles
2497,but the war had drawn the sting of her femininity poor devils one thought poor devils of both sexes
2498,he was always carrying a book about under his arm   ”a purple book
2499,he worked
2500,he sat she remembered working in a blaze of sun
2501,at dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view
2502,but after all she reflected there was the scene on the beach
2503,one must remember that
2504,it was a windy morning
2505,they had all gone down to the beach
2506,mrs ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock
2507,she wrote and wrote
2508,oh she said looking up at something floating in the sea is it a lobster pot is it an upturned boat
2509,she was so short sighted that she could not see and then charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be
2510,he began playing ducks and drakes
2511,they chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves
2512,every now and then mrs ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them
2513,what they said she could not remember but only she and charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and mrs ramsay watching them
2514,she was highly conscious of that
2515,mrs ramsay she thought stepping back and screwing up her eyes
2516,it must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with james there must have been a shadow
2517,when she thought of herself and charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach it seemed to depend somehow upon mrs ramsay sitting under the rock with a pad on her knee writing letters
2518,she wrote innumerable letters and sometimes the wind took them and she and charles just saved a page from the sea
2519,but what a power was in the human soul she thought
2520,that woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity made these angers irritations fall off like old rags she brought together this and that and then this and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite she and charles squabbling sparring had been silly and spiteful something   ”this scene on the beach for example this moment of friendship and liking   ”which survived after all these years complete so that she dipped into it to re fashion her memory of him and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art
2521,like a work of art she repeated looking from her canvas to the drawing room steps and back again
2522,she must rest for a moment
2523,and resting looking from one to the other vaguely the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually the vast the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these when she released faculties that had been on the strain stood over her paused over her darkened over her
2524,what is the meaning of life
2525,that was all   ”a simple question one that tended to close in on one with years
2526,the great revelation had never come
2527,the great revelation perhaps never did come
2528,instead there were little daily miracles illuminations matches struck unexpectedly in the dark here was one
2529,this that and the other herself and charles tansley and the breaking wave mrs ramsay bringing them together mrs ramsay saying life stand still here mrs ramsay making of the moment something permanent as in another sphere lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent   ”this was of the nature of a revelation
2530,in the midst of chaos there was shape this eternal passing and flowing she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking was struck into stability
2531,life stand still here mrs ramsay said
2532,mrs ramsay mrs ramsay she repeated
2533,she owed it all to her
2534,all was silence
2535,nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house
2536,she looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves
2537,the faint thought she was thinking of mrs ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house this smoke this fine early morning air
2538,faint and unreal it was amazingly pure and exciting
2539,she hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house but that she might be left alone to go on thinking to go on painting
2540,she turned to her canvas
2541,but impelled by some curiosity driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether down there on the beach she could see that little company setting sail
2542,down there among the little boats which floated some with their sails furled some slowly for it was very calm moving away there was one rather apart from the others
2543,the sail was even now being hoisted
2544,she decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat mr ramsay was sitting with cam and james
2545,now they had got the sail up now after a little flagging and silence she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea
2546,the sails flapped over their heads
2547,the water chuckled and slapped the sides of the boat which drowsed motionless in the sun
2548,now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them but the ripple ran over them and ceased
2549,the boat made no motion at all
2550,mr ramsay sat in the middle of the boat
2551,he would be impatient in a moment james thought and cam thought looking at her father who sat in the middle of the boat between them james steered cam sat alone in the bow with his legs tightly curled
2552,he hated hanging about
2553,sure enough after fidgeting a second or two he said something sharp to macalister own boy who got out his oars and began to row
2554,but their father they knew would never be content until they were flying along
2555,he would keep looking for a breeze fidgeting saying things under his breath which macalister and and macalister own boy would overhear and they would both be made horribly uncomfortable
2556,he had made them come
2557,he had forced them to come
2558,in their anger they hoped that the breeze would never rise that he might be thwarted in every possible way since he had forced them to come against their wills
2559,all the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together though he bade them walk up walk up without speaking
2560,their heads were bent down their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale
2561,speak to him they could not
2562,they must come they must follow
2563,they must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels
2564,but they vowed in silence as they walked to stand by each other and carry out the great compact   ”to resist tyranny to the death
2565,so there they would sit one at one end of the boat one at the other in silence
2566,they would say nothing only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs twisted frowning and fidgeting and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to himself and waiting impatiently for a breeze
2567,and they hoped it would be calm
2568,they hoped he would be thwarted
2569,they hoped the whole expedition would fail and they would have to put back with their parcels to the beach
2570,but now when macalister own boy had rowed a little way out the sails slowly swung round the boat quickened itself flattened itself and shot off
2571,instantly as if some great strain had been relieved mr ramsay uncurled his legs took out his tobacco pouch handed it with a little grunt to macalister and felt they knew for all they suffered perfectly content
2572,now they would sail on for hours like this and mr ramsay would ask old macalister a question   ”about the great storm last winter probably   ”and old macalister would answer it and they would puff their pipes together and macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers tying or untying some knot and the boy would fish and never say a word to any one
2573,james would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail
2574,for if he forgot then the sail puckered and shivered and the boat slackened and mr ramsay would say sharply look out look out and old macalister would turn slowly on his seat
2575,so they heard mr ramsay asking some question about the great storm at christmas
2576,she comes driving round the point old macalister said describing the great storm last christmas when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter and he had seen one there one there one there he pointed slowly round the bay mr ramsay followed him turning his head
2577,he had seen four men clinging to the mast
2578,then she was gone
2579,and at last we shoved her off he went on but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there sitting at opposite ends of the boat united by their compact to fight tyranny to the death
2580,at last they had shoved her off they had launched the lifeboat and they had got her out past the point   ”macalister told the story and though they only caught a word here and there they were conscious all the time of their father   ”how he leant forward how he brought his voice into tune with macalister own voice how puffing at his pipe and looking there and there where macalister pointed he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there
2581,he liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind he liked men to work like that and women to keep house and sit beside sleeping children indoors while men were drowned out there in a storm
2582,so james could tell so cam could tell they looked at him they looked at each other from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice and the little tinge of scottish accent which came into his voice making him seem like a peasant himself as he questioned macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm
2583,three had sunk
2584,he looked proudly where macalister pointed and cam thought feeling proud of him without knowing quite why had he been there he would have launched the lifeboat he would have reached the wreck cam thought
2585,he was so brave he was so adventurous cam thought
2586,but she remembered
2587,there was the compact to resist tyranny to the death
2588,their grievance weighed them down
2589,they had been forced they had been bidden
2590,he had borne them down once more with his gloom and his authority making them do his bidding on this fine morning come because he wished it carrying these parcels to the lighthouse take part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of dead people which they hated so that they lagged after him all the pleasure of the day was spoilt
2591,yes the breeze was freshening
2592,the boat was leaning the water was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades in bubbles in cataracts
2593,cam looked down into the foam into the sea with all its treasure in it and its speed hypnotised her and the tie between her and james sagged a little
2594,it slackened a little
2595,she began to think how fast it goes
2596,where are we going
2597,and the movement hypnotised her while james with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon steered grimly
2598,but he began to think as he steered that he might escape he might be quit of it all
2599,they might land somewhere and be free then
2600,both of them looking at each other for a moment had a sense of escape and exaltation what with the speed and the change
2601,but the breeze bred in mr ramsay too the same excitement and as old macalister turned to fling his line overboard he cried out aloud
2602,we perished and then again each alone
2603,and then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness pulled himself up and waved his hand towards the shore
2604,see the little house he said pointing wishing cam to look
2605,she raised herself reluctantly and looked
2606,but which was it
2607,she could no longer make out there on the hillside which was their house
2608,all looked distant and peaceful and strange
2609,the shore seemed refined far away unreal
2610,already the little distance they had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look the composed look of something receding in which one has no longer any part
2611,which was their house
2612,she could not see it
2613,but i beneath a rougher sea mr ramsay murmured
2614,he had found the house and so seeing it he had also seen himself there he had seen himself walking on the terrace alone
2615,he was walking up and down between the urns and he seemed to himself very old and bowed
2616,sitting in the boat he bowed he crouched himself acting instantly his part   ” the part of a desolate man widowed bereft and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him staged for himself as he sat in the boat a little drama which required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow he raised his hands and looked at the thinness of them to confirm his dream and then there was given him in abundance women own sympathy and he imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him and so getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure women own sympathy was to him he sighed and said gently and mournfully
2617,but i beneath a rougher sea
2618,was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he
2619,so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all
2620,cam half started on her seat
2621,it shocked her   ”it outraged her
2622,the movement roused her father and he shuddered and broke off exclaiming look look so urgently that james also turned his head to look over his shoulder at the island
2623,they all looked
2624,they looked at the island
2625,but cam could see nothing
2626,she was thinking how all those paths and the lawn thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there were gone were rubbed out were past were unreal and now this was real the boat and the sail with its patch macalister with his earrings the noise of the waves   ”all this was real
2627,thinking this she was murmuring to herself we perished each alone for her father own words broke and broke again in her mind when her father seeing her gazing so vaguely began to tease her
2628,did not she know the points of the compass
2629,he asked
2630,did not she know the north from the south
2631,did she really think they lived right out there
2632,and he pointed again and showed her where their house was there by those trees
2633,he wished she would try to be more accurate he said tell me   ”which is east which is west he said half laughing at her half scolding her for he could not understand the state of mind of any one not absolutely imbecile who did not know the points of the compass
2634,yet she did not know
2635,and seeing her gazing with her vague now rather frightened eyes fixed where no house was mr ramsay forgot his dream how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace how the arms were stretched out to him
2636,he thought women are always like that the vagueness of their minds is hopeless it was a thing he had never been able to understand but so it was
2637,it had been so with her   ”his wife
2638,they could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds
2639,but he had been wrong to be angry with her moreover did he not rather like this vagueness in women
2640,it was part of their extraordinary charm
2641,i will make her smile at me he thought
2642,she looks frightened
2643,she was so silent
2644,he clutched his fingers and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves
2645,he would make her smile at him
2646,he would find some simple easy thing to say to her
2647,but what
2648,for wrapped up in his work as he was he forgot the sort of thing one said
2649,there was a puppy
2650,they had a puppy
2651,who was looking after the puppy today
2652,he asked
2653,yes thought james pitilessly seeing his sister own head against the sail now she will give way
2654,i shall be left to fight the tyrant alone
2655,the compact would be left to him to carry out
2656,cam would never resist tyranny to the death he thought grimly watching her face sad sulky yielding
2657,and as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding hills is gloom and sorrow and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded the darkened either in pity or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay so cam now felt herself overcast as she sat there among calm resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy how to resist his entreaty   ”forgive me care for me while james the lawgiver with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her said resist him
2658,fight him
2659,he said so rightly justly
2660,for they must fight tyranny to the death she thought
2661,of all human qualities she reverenced justice most
2662,her brother was most god like her father most suppliant
2663,and to which did she yield she thought sitting between them gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there
2664,jasper she said sullenly
2665,he would look after the puppy
2666,and what was she going to call him
2667,her father persisted
2668,he had had a dog when he was a little boy called frisk
2669,she will give way james thought as he watched a look come upon her face a look he remembered
2670,they look down he thought at their knitting or something
2671,then suddenly they look up
2672,there was a flash of blue he remembered and then somebody sitting with him laughed surrendered and he was very angry
2673,it must have been his mother he thought sitting on a low chair with his father standing over her
2674,he began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down leaf upon leaf fold upon fold softly incessantly upon his brain among scents sounds voices harsh hollow sweet and lights passing and brooms tapping and the wash and hush of the sea how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead upright over them
2675,meanwhile he noticed cam dabbled her fingers in the water and stared at the shore and said nothing
2676,no she will not give way he thought she is different he thought
2677,well if cam would not answer him he would not bother her mr ramsay decided feeling in his pocket for a book
2678,but she would answer him she wished passionately to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say oh yes frisk
2679,I will call him frisk
2680,she wanted even to say was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone
2681,but try as she might she could think of nothing to say like that fierce and loyal to the compact yet passing on to her father unsuspected by james a private token of the love she felt for him
2682,for she thought dabbling her hand and now macalister own boy had caught a mackerel and it lay kicking on the floor with blood on its gills for she thought looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon you are not exposed to it to this pressure and division of feeling this extraordinary temptation
2683,her father was feeling in his pockets in another second he would have found his book
2684,for no one attracted her more his hands were beautiful and his feet and his voice and his words and his haste and his temper and his oddity and his passion and his saying straight out before every one we perish each alone and his remoteness
2685,he had opened his book
2686,but what remained intolerable she thought sitting upright and watching macalister own boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his some insolence do this do that his dominance his submit to me
2687,so she said nothing but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore wrapped in its mantle of peace as if the people there had fallen asleep she thought were free like smoke were free to come and go like ghosts
2688,they have no suffering there she thought
2689,yes that is their boat lily briscoe decided standing on the edge of the lawn
2690,it was the boat with greyish brown sails which she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay
2691,there he sits she thought and the children are quite silent still
2692,and she could not reach him either
2693,the sympathy she had not given him weighed her down
2694,it made it difficult for her to paint
2695,she had always found him difficult
2696,she never had been able to praise him to his face she remembered
2697,and that reduced their relationship to something neutral without that element of sex in it which made his manner to minta so gallant almost gay
2698,he would pick a flower for her lend her his books
2699,but could he believe that minta read them
2700,she dragged them about the garden sticking in leaves to mark the place
2701,dyou remember mr carmichael she was inclined to ask looking at the old man
2702,but he had pulled his hat half over his forehead he was asleep or he was dreaming or he was lying there catching words she supposed
2703,dyou remember she felt inclined to ask him as she passed him thinking again of mrs ramsay on the beach the cask bobbing up and down and the pages flying
2704,why after all these years had that survived ringed round lit up visible to the last detail with all before it blank and all after it blank for miles and miles
2705,is it a boat is it a cork she would say lily repeated turning back reluctantly again to her canvas
2706,heaven be praised for it the problem of space remained she thought taking up her brush again
2707,it glared at her
2708,the whole mass of the picture was poised upon that weight
2709,beautiful and bright it should be on the surface feathery and evanescent one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly own wing but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron
2710,it was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses
2711,and she began to lay on a red a grey and she began to model her way into the hollow there
2712,at the same time she seemed to be sitting beside mrs ramsay on the beach
2713,is it a boat is it a cask
2714,mrs ramsay said
2715,and she began hunting round for her spectacles
2716,and she sat having found them silent looking out to sea
2717,and lily painting steadily felt as if a door had opened and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high cathedral like place very dark very solemn
2718,shouts came from a world far away
2719,steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon
2720,charles threw stones and sent them skipping
2721,mrs ramsay sat silent
2722,she was glad lily thought to rest in silence uncommunicative to rest in the extreme obscurity of human relationships
2723,who knows what we are what we feel
2724,who knows even at the moment of intimacy this is knowledge
2725,are not things spoilt then mrs ramsay may have asked it seemed to have happened so often this silence by her side by saying them
2726,are not we more expressive thus
2727,the moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile
2728,she rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up by way of burying in it the perfection of the moment
2729,it was like a drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of the past
2730,lily stepped back to get her canvas   ”so   ”into perspective
2731,it was an odd road to be walking this of painting
2732,out and out one went further until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank perfectly alone over the sea
2733,and as she dipped into the blue paint she dipped too into the past there
2734,now mrs ramsay got up she remembered
2735,it was time to go back to the house   ”time for luncheon
2736,and they all walked up from the beach together she walking behind with william bankes and there was minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking
2737,how that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them
2738,how william bankes deplored it without so far as she could remember saying anything about it
2739,it meant to him the annihilation of womanhood and dirt and disorder and servants leaving and beds not made at mid day   ”all the things he most abhorred
2740,he had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did now   ”holding his hand in front of him
2741,and minta walked on ahead and presumably paul met her and she went off with paul in the garden
2742,the rayleys thought lily briscoe squeezing her tube of green paint
2743,she collected her impressions of the rayleys
2744,their lives appeared to her in a series of scenes one on the staircase at dawn
2745,paul had come in and gone to bed early minta was late
2746,there was minta wreathed tinted garish on the stairs about three of the clock in the morning
2747,paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars
2748,minta was eating a sandwich standing half way up by a window in the cadaverous early morning light and the carpet had a hole in it
2749,but what did they say
2750,lily asked herself as if by looking she could hear them
2751,minta went on eating her sandwich annoyingly while he spoke something violent abusing her in a mutter so as not to wake the children the two little boys
2752,he was withered drawn she flamboyant careless
2753,for things had worked loose after the first year or so the marriage had turned out rather badly
2754,and this lily thought taking the green paint on her brush this making up scenes about them is what we call knowing people thinking of them being fond of them
2755,not a word of it was true she had made it up but it was what she knew them by all the same
2756,she went on tunnelling her way into her picture into the past
2757,another time paul said he played chess in coffee houses
2758,she had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too
2759,she remembered how as he said it she thought how he rang up the servant and she said mrs rayley own out sir and he decided that he would not come home either
2760,she saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats and the waitresses got to know you and he played chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at surbiton but that was all paul knew about him
2761,and then minta was out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs when he got the poker in case of burglars no doubt to frighten her too and spoke so bitterly saying she had ruined his life
2762,at any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near rickmansworth things were horribly strained
2763,paul took her down the garden to look at the belgian hares which he bred and minta followed them singing and put her bare arm on his shoulder lest he should tell her anything
2764,minta was bored by hares lily thought
2765,but minta never gave herself away
2766,she never said things like that about playing chess in coffee  houses
2767,she was far too conscious far too wary
2768,but to go on with their story   ”they had got through the dangerous stage by now
2769,she had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and minta had to hand him his tools
2770,he sat on the road mending the car and it was the way she gave him the tools   ”business like straightforward friendly   ”that proved it was all right now
2771,they were in love no longer no he had taken up with another woman a serious woman with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand minta had described her gratefully almost admiringly who went to meetings and shared paul own views they had got more and more pronounced about the taxation of land values and a capital levy
2772,far from breaking up the marriage that alliance had righted it
2773,they were excellent friends obviously as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools
2774,so that was the story of the rayleys lily thought
2775,she imagined herself telling it to mrs ramsay who would be full of curiosity to know what had become of the rayleys
2776,she would feel a little triumphant telling mrs ramsay that the marriage had not been a success
2777,but the dead thought lily encountering some obstacle in her design which made her pause and ponder stepping back a foot or so oh the dead she murmured one pitied them one brushed them aside one had even a little contempt for them
2778,they are at our mercy
2779,mrs ramsay has faded and gone she thought
2780,we can over ride her wishes improve away her limited old fashioned ideas
2781,she recedes further and further from us
2782,mockingly she seemed to see her there at the end of the corridor of years saying of all incongruous things marry marry sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to cheep in the garden outside
2783,and one would have to say to her it has all gone against your wishes
2784,they are happy like that I am happy like this
2785,life has changed completely
2786,at that all her being even her beauty became for a moment dusty and out of date
2787,for a moment lily standing there with the sun hot on her back summing up the rayleys triumphed over mrs ramsay who would never know how paul went to coffee houses and had a mistress how he sat on the ground and minta handed him his tools how she stood here painting had never married not even william bankes
2788,mrs ramsay had planned it
2789,perhaps had she lived she would have compelled it
2790,already that summer he was the kindest of men
2791,he was the first scientist of his age my husband says
2792,he was also poor william   ”it makes me so unhappy when i go to see him to find nothing nice in his house   ”no one to arrange the flowers
2793,so they were sent for walks together and she was told with that faint touch of irony that made mrs ramsay slip through one own fingers that she had a scientific mind she liked flowers she was so exact
2794,what was this mania of hers for marriage
2795,lily wondered stepping to and fro from her easel
2796,suddenly as suddenly as a star slides in the sky a reddish light seemed to burn in her mind covering paul rayley issuing from him it rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a distant beach she heard the roar and the crackle the whole sea for miles round ran red and gold some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a beach and the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and disgust as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house greedily disgustingly and she loathed it but for a sight for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea and one had only to say in love and instantly as happened now up rose paul own fire again and it sank and she said to herself laughing the rayleys how paul went to coffee houses and played chess
2797,she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though she thought
2798,she had been looking at the table cloth and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle and need never marry anybody and she had felt an enormous exultation
2799,she had felt now she could stand up to mrs ramsay   ”a tribute to the astonishing power that mrs ramsay had over one
2800,do this she said and one did it
2801,even her shadow at the window with james was full of authority
2802,she remembered how william bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son
2803,did she not admire their beauty
2804,he said
2805,but william she remembered had listened to her with his wise child own eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence how a light there needed a shadow there and so on
2806,she did not intend to disparage a subject which they agreed raphael had treated divinely
2807,she was not cynical
2808,quite the contrary
2809,thanks to his scientific mind he understood   ”a proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted her enormously
2810,one could talk of painting then seriously to a man
2811,indeed his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life
2812,she loved william bankes
2813,they went to hampton court and he always left her like the perfect gentleman he was plenty of time to wash her hands while he strolled by the river
2814,that was typical of their relationship
2815,many things were left unsaid
2816,then they strolled through the courtyards and admired summer after summer the proportions and the flowers and he would tell her things about perspective about architecture as they walked and he would stop to look at a tree or the view over the lake and admire a child   ”it was his great grief   ”he had no daughter in the vague aloof way that was natural to a man who spent spent so much time in laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him so that he walked slowly lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused with his head thrown back merely to breathe the air
2817,then he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday he must buy a new carpet for the staircase
2818,perhaps she would go with him to buy a new carpet for the staircase
2819,and once something led him to talk about the ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been wearing a grey hat she was not more than nineteen or twenty
2820,she was astonishingly beautiful
2821,there he stood looking down the avenue at hampton court as if he could see her there among the fountains
2822,she looked now at the drawing room step
2823,she saw through william own eyes the shape of a woman peaceful and silent with downcast eyes
2824,she sat musing pondering she was in grey that day lily thought
2825,her eyes were bent
2826,she would never lift them
2827,yes thought lily looking intently i must have seen her look like that but not in grey nor so still nor so young nor so peaceful
2828,the figure came readily enough
2829,she was astonishingly beautiful as william said
2830,but beauty was not everything
2831,beauty had this penalty   ”it came too readily came too completely
2832,it stilled life   ”froze it
2833,one forgot the little agitations the flush the pallor some queer distortion some light or shadow which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after
2834,it was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty
2835,but what was the look she had lily wondered when she clapped her deer stalkers own hat on her head or ran across the grass or scolded kennedy the gardener
2836,who could tell her
2837,who could help her
2838,against her will she had come to the surface and found herself half out of the picture looking little dazedly as if at unreal things at mr carmichael
2839,he lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch not reading or sleeping but basking like a creature gorged with existence
2840,his book had fallen on to the grass
2841,she wanted to go straight up to him and say mr carmichael
2842,then he would look up benevolently as always from his smoky vague green eyes
2843,but one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them
2844,and she wanted to say not one thing but everything
2845,little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing
2846,about life about death about mrs ramsay   ”no she thought one could say nothing to nobody
2847,the urgency of the moment always missed its mark
2848,words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low
2849,then one gave it up then the idea sunk back again then one became like most middle aged people cautious furtive with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension
2850,for how could one express in words these emotions of the body
2851,express that emptiness there
2852,she was looking at the drawing room steps they looked extraordinarily empty
2853,it was one own body feeling not one own mind
2854,the physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant
2855,to want and not to have sent all up her body a hardness a hollowness a strain
2856,and then to want and not to have   ”to want and want   ”how that wrung the heart and wrung it again and again
2857,oh mrs ramsay she called out silently to that essence which sat by the boat that abstract one made of her that woman in grey as if to abuse her for having gone and then having gone come back again
2858,it had seemed so safe thinking of her
2859,ghost air nothingness a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time of day or night she had been that and then suddenly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus
2860,suddenly the empty drawing room steps the frill of the chair inside the puppy tumbling on the terrace the whole wave and whisper of the garden became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness
2861,what does it mean how do you explain it all she wanted to say turning to mr carmichael again
2862,for the whole world seemed to have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought a deep basin of reality and one could almost fancy that had mr carmichael spoken for instance a little tear would have rent the surface pool
2863,and then
2864,something would emerge
2865,a hand would be shoved up a blade would be flashed
2866,it was nonsense of course
2867,a curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the things she could not say
2868,he was an inscrutable old man with the yellow stain on his beard and his poetry and his puzzles sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted
2869,she looked at her picture
2870,that would have been his answer presumably   ”how you and i and she pass and vanish nothing stays all changes but not words not paint
2871,yet it would be hung in the attics she thought it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa yet even so even of a picture like that it was true
2872,one might say even of this scrawl not of that actual picture perhaps but of what it attempted that it remained for ever she was going to say or for the words spoken sounded even to herself too boastful to hint wordlessly when looking at the picture she was surprised to find that she could not see it
2873,her eyes were full of a hot liquid she did not think of tears at first which without disturbing the firmness of her lips made the air thick rolled down her cheeks
2874,she had perfect control of herself   ”oh yes
2875,  ”in every other way
2876,was she crying then for mrs ramsay without being aware of any unhappiness
2877,she addressed old mr carmichael again
2878,what was it then
2879,what did it mean
2880,could things thrust their hands up and grip one could the blade cut the fist grasp
2881,was there no safety
2882,no learning by heart of the ways of the world
2883,no guide no shelter but all was miracle and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air
2884,could it be even for elderly people that this was life
2885,  ”startling unexpected unknown
2886,for one moment she felt that if they both got up here now on the lawn and demanded an explanation why was it so short why was it so inexplicable said it with violence as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak then beauty would roll itself up the space would fill those empty flourishes would form into shape if they shouted loud enough mrs ramsay would return
2887,mrs ramsay she said aloud mrs ramsay
2888,the tears ran down her face
2889,macalister own boy took one of the fish and cut a square out of its side to bait his hook with
2890,the mutilated body it was alive still was thrown back into the sea
2891,mrs ramsay
2892,lily cried mrs ramsay
2893,but nothing happened
2894,the pain increased
2895,that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of imbecility she thought
2896,anyhow the old man had not heard her
2897,he remained benignant calm   ”if one chose to think it sublime
2898,heaven be praised no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry stop pain stop
2899,she had not obviously taken leave of her senses
2900,no one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation
2901,she remained a skimpy old maid holding a paint brush
2902,and now slowly the pain of the want and the bitter anger to be called back just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for mrs ramsay again had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast not in the least lessened and of their anguish left as antidote a relief that was balm in itself and also but more mysteriously a sense of some one there of mrs ramsay relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her staying lightly by her side and then for this was mrs ramsay in all her beauty raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went
2903,lily squeezed her tubes again
2904,she attacked that problem of the hedge
2905,it was strange how clearly she saw her stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds purplish and soft among whose flowers hyacinth or lilies she vanished
2906,it was some trick of the painter own eye
2907,for days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion a shade across the fields
2908,the sight the phrase had its power to console
2909,wherever she happened to be painting here in the country or in london the vision would come to her and her eyes half closing sought something to base her vision on
2910,she looked down the railway carriage the omnibus took a line from shoulder or cheek looked at the windows opposite at piccadilly lamp strung in the evening
2911,all had been part of the fields of death
2912,but always something   ”it might be a face a voice a paper boy crying standard news   ”thrust through snubbed her waked her required and got in the end an effort of attention so that the vision must be perpetually remade
2913,now again moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue she looked at the bay beneath her making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves and stony fields of the purpler spaces again she was roused as usual by something incongruous
2914,there was a brown spot in the middle of the bay
2915,it was a boat
2916,yes she realised that after a second
2917,but whose boat
2918,mr ramsay own boat she replied
2919,mr ramsay the man who had marched past her with his hand raised aloof at the head of a procession in his beautiful boots asking her for sympathy which she had refused
2920,the boat was now half way across the bay
2921,so fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric as if sails were stuck high up in the sky or the clouds had dropped down into the sea
2922,a steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively as if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh only gently swaying them this way and that
2923,and as happens sometimes when the weather is very fine the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs as if they signalled to each other some message of their own
2924,for sometimes quite close to the shore the lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous distance away
2925,where are they now
2926,lily thought looking out to sea
2927,where was he that very old man who had gone past her silently holding a brown paper parcel under his arm
2928,the boat was in the middle of the bay
2929,they do not feel a thing there cam thought looking at the shore which rising and falling became steadily more distant and more peaceful
2930,her hand cut a trail in the sea as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and numbed and shrouded wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays where in the green light a change came over one own entire mind and one own body shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak
2931,then the eddy slackened round her hand
2932,the rush of the water ceased the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds
2933,one heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour
2934,everything became very close to one
2935,for the sail upon which james had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew sagged entirely there they came to a stop flapping about waiting for a breeze in the hot sun miles from shore miles from the lighthouse
2936,everything in the whole world seemed to stand still
2937,the lighthouse became immovable and the line of the distant shore became fixed
2938,the sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other own presence which they had almost forgotten
2939,macalister own fishing line went plumb down into the sea
2940,but mr ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him
2941,he was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover own egg
2942,now and again as they hung about in that horrid calm he turned a page
2943,and james felt that each page was turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him now assertively now commandingly now with the intention of making people pity him and all the time as his father read and turned one after another of those little pages james kept dreading the moment when he would look up and speak sharply to him about something or other
2944,why were they lagging about here
2945,he would demand or something quite unreasonable like that
2946,and if he does james thought then i shall take a knife and strike him to the heart
2947,he had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart
2948,only now as he grew older and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage it was not him that old man reading whom he wanted to kill but it was the thing that descended on him   ”without his knowing it perhaps that fierce sudden black winged harpy with its talons and its beak all cold and hard that struck and struck at you he could feel the beak on his bare legs where it had struck when he was a child and then made off and there he was again an old man very sad reading his book
2949,that he would kill that he would strike to the heart
2950,whatever he did   ”and he might do anything he felt looking at the lighthouse and the distant shore whether he was in a business in a bank a barrister a man at the head of some enterprise that he would fight that he would track down and stamp out   ”tyranny despotism he called it   ”making people do what they did not want to do cutting off their right to speak
2951,how could any of them say but i will not when he said come to the lighthouse
2952,do this
2953,fetch me that
2954,the black wings spread and the hard beak tore
2955,and then next moment there he sat reading his book and he might look up   ”one never knew   ”quite reasonably
2956,he might talk to the macalisters
2957,he might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman own hand in the street james thought and he might be shouting out at some fisherman own sports he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement
2958,or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other
2959,yes thought james while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere and there he had come to feel quite often lately when his father said something or did something which surprised the others there were two pairs of footprints only his own and his father own
2960,they alone knew each other
2961,what then was this terror this hatred
2962,turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted and one blunders now with the sun in one own eyes now with a dark shadow he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape
2963,suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator or on some one own knee he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently some one own foot
2964,suppose he had seen the foot first in the grass smooth and whole then the wheel and the same foot purple crushed
2965,but the wheel was innocent
2966,so now when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the lighthouse down it came over his foot over cam own foot over anybody own foot
2967,one sat and watched it
2968,but whose foot was he thinking of and in what garden did all this happen
2969,for one had settings for these scenes trees that grew there flowers a certain light a few figures
2970,everything tended to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom
2971,none of this throwing of hands about people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice
2972,they went in and out all day long
2973,there was an old woman gossiping in the kitchen and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze all was blowing all was growing and over all those plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn like a vine leaf at night
2974,things became stiller and darker at night
2975,but the leaf like veil was so fine that lights lifted it voices crinkled it he could see through it a figure stooping hear coming close going away some dress rustling some chain tinkling
2976,it was in this world that the wheel went over the person own foot
2977,something he remembered stayed flourished up in the air something arid and sharp descended even there like a blade a scimitar smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it shrivel and fall
2978,it will rain he remembered his father saying
2979,you will not be able to go to the lighthouse
2980,the lighthouse was then a silvery misty looking tower with a yellow eye that opened suddenly and softly in the evening
2981,now   ”
2982,james looked at the lighthouse
2983,he could see the white washed rocks the tower stark and straight he could see that it was barred with black and white he could see windows in it he could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry
2984,so that was the lighthouse was it
2985,no the other was also the lighthouse
2986,for nothing was simply one thing
2987,the other lighthouse was true too
2988,it was sometimes hardly to be seen across the bay
2989,in the evening one looked up and saw the eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them in that airy sunny garden where they sat
2990,but he pulled himself up
2991,whenever he said they or a person and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming the tinkle of some one going he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever might be in the room
2992,it was his father now
2993,the strain was acute
2994,for in one moment if there was no breeze his father would slap the covers of his book together and say what is happening now what are we dawdling about here for eh as once before he had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over and if there had been an axe handy a knife or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart
2995,she had gone stiff all over and then her arm slackening so that he felt she listened to him no longer she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there impotent ridiculous sitting on the floor grasping a pair of scissors
2996,not a breath of wind blew
2997,the water chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them
2998,at any moment mr ramsay he scarcely dared look at him might rouse himself shut his book and say something sharp but for the moment he was reading so that james stealthily as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board went on thinking what was she like where did she go that day
2999,he began following her from room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light as if the reflection came from many china dishes she talked to somebody he listened to her talking
3000,she talked to a servant saying simply whatever came into her head
3001,she alone spoke the truth to her alone could he speak it
3002,that was the source of her everlasting attraction for him perhaps she was a person to whom one could say what came into one own head
3003,but all the time he thought of her he was conscious of his father following his thought surveying it making it shiver and falter
3004,at last he ceased to think
3005,there he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun staring at the lighthouse powerless to move powerless to flick off these grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another
3006,a rope seemed to bind him there and his father had knotted it and he could only escape by taking a knife and plunging itbut at that moment the sail swung slowly round filled slowly out the boat seemed to shake herself and then to move off half conscious in her sleep and then she woke and shot through the waves
3007,the relief was extraordinary
3008,they all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their ease and the fishing lines slanted taut across the side of the boat
3009,but his father did not rouse himself
3010,he only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony
3011,the sea without a stain on it thought lily briscoe still standing and looking out over the bay
3012,the sea stretched like silk across the bay
3013,distance had an extraordinary power they had been swallowed up in it she felt they were gone for ever they had become part of the nature of things
3014,it was so calm it was so quiet
3015,the steamer itself had vanished but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction
3016,it was like that then the island thought cam once more drawing her fingers through the waves
3017,she had never seen it from out at sea before
3018,it lay like that on the sea did it with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags and the sea swept in there and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island
3019,it was very small shaped something like a leaf stood on end
3020,so we took a little boat she thought beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship
3021,but with the sea streaming through her fingers a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them she did not want to tell herself seriously a story it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted for she was thinking as the boat sailed on how her father own anger about the points of the compass james own obstinacy about the compact and her own anguish all had slipped all had passed all had streamed away
3022,what then came next
3023,where were they going
3024,from her hand ice cold held deep in the sea there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change at the escape at the adventure that she should be alive that she should be there
3025,and the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark the slumbrous shapes in her mind shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness catching here and there a spark of light greece rome constantinople
3026,small as it was and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold  sprinkled waters flowing in and about it it had she supposed a place in the universe   ”even that little island
3027,the old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her
3028,sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it
3029,there they were it might be mr carmichael or mr bankes who was sitting with her father sitting opposite each other in their low arm chairs
3030,they were crackling in front of them the pages of the times when she came in from the garden all in a muddle about something some one had said about christ or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a london street or wondering what napoleon was like
3031,then they took all this with their clean hands they wore grey coloured clothes they smelt of heather and they brushed the scraps together turning the paper crossing their knees and said something now and then very brief
3032,just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there watching her father write so equally so neatly from one side of the page to another with a little cough now and then or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite
3033,and she thought standing there with her book open one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water and if it did well here among the old gentlemen smoking and the times crackling then it was right
3034,and watching her father as he wrote in his study she thought now sitting in the boat he was not vain nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him
3035,indeed if he saw she was there reading a book he would ask her as gently as any one could was there nothing he could give her
3036,lest this should be wrong she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover own egg
3037,no it was right
3038,look at him now she wanted to say aloud to james
3039,but james had his eye on the sail
3040,he is a sarcastic brute james would say
3041,he brings the talk round to himself and his books james would say
3042,he is intolerably egotistical
3043,worst of all he is a tyrant
3044,but look she said looking at him
3045,look at him now
3046,she looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled the little book whose yellowish pages she knew without knowing what was written on them
3047,it was small it was closely printed on the fly leaf she knew he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner the wine had been so much he had given so much to the waiter all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page
3048,but what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket she did not know
3049,what he thought they none of them knew
3050,but he was absorbed in it so that when he looked up as he did now for an instant it was not to see anything it was to pin down some thought more exactly
3051,that done his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading
3052,he read she thought as if he were guiding something or wheedling a large flock of sheep or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path and sometimes he went fast and straight and broke his way through the bramble and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him a bramble blinded him but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that on he went tossing over page after page
3053,and she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship for she was safe while he sat there safe as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden and took a book down and the old gentleman lowering the paper suddenly said something very brief over the top of it about the character of napoleon
3054,she gazed back over the sea at the island
3055,but the leaf was losing its sharpness
3056,it was very small it was very distant
3057,the sea was more important now than the shore
3058,waves were all round them tossing and sinking with a log wallowing down one wave a gull riding on another
3059,about here she thought dabbling her fingers in the water a ship had sunk and she murmured dreamily half asleep how we perished each alone
3060,so much depends then thought lily briscoe looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue so much depends she thought upon distance whether people are near us or far from us for her feeling for mr ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay
3061,it seemed to be elongated stretched out he seemed to become more and more remote
3062,he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue that distance but here on the lawn close at hand mr carmichael suddenly grunted
3063,she laughed
3064,he clawed his book up from the grass
3065,he settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster
3066,that was different altogether because he was so near
3067,and now again all was quiet
3068,they must be out of bed by this time she supposed looking at the house but nothing appeared there
3069,but then she remembered they had always made off directly a meal was over on business of their own
3070,it was all in keeping with this silence this emptiness and the unreality of the early morning hour
3071,it was a way things had sometimes she thought lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke they became illness before habits had spun themselves across the surface one felt that same unreality which was so startling felt something emerge
3072,life was most vivid then
3073,one could be at one own ease
3074,mercifully one need not say very briskly crossing the lawn to greet old mrs beckwith who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in oh good morning mrs beckwith what a lovely day are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun jasper own hidden the chairs do let me find you one and all the rest of the usual chatter
3075,one need not speak at all
3076,one glided one shook one own sails there was a good deal of movement in the bay boats were starting off between things beyond things
3077,empty it was not but full to the brim
3078,she seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance to move and float and sink in it yes for these waters were unfathomably deep
3079,into them had spilled so many lives
3080,the ramsays the children own and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides
3081,a washer woman with her basket a rook a red hot poker the purples and grey greens of flowers some common feeling which held the whole together
3082,it was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which ten years ago standing almost where she stood now had made her say that she must be in love with the place
3083,love had a thousand shapes
3084,there might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the elements of things and place them together and so giving them a wholeness not theirs in life make of some scene or meeting of people all now gone and separate one of those globed compacted things over which thought lingers and love plays
3085,her eyes rested on the brown speck of mr ramsay own sailing boat
3086,they would be at the lighthouse by lunch time she supposed
3087,but the wind had freshened and as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed slightly and the boats altered their positions the view which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed was now unsatisfactory
3088,the wind had blown the trail of smoke about there was something displeasing about the placing of the ships
3089,the disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind
3090,she felt an obscure distress
3091,it was confirmed when she turned to her picture
3092,she had been wasting her morning
3093,for whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite forces mr ramsay and the picture which was necessary
3094,there was something perhaps wrong with the design
3095,was it she wondered that the line of the wall wanted breaking was it that the mass of the trees was too heavy
3096,she smiled ironically for had she not thought when she began that she had solved her problem
3097,what was the problem then
3098,she must try to get hold of something tht evaded her
3099,it evaded her when she thought of mrs ramsay it evaded her now when she thought of her picture
3100,phrases came
3101,visions came
3102,beautiful pictures
3103,beautiful phrases
3104,but what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves the thing itself before it has been made anything
3105,get that and start afresh get that and start afresh she said desperately pitching herself firmly again before her easel
3106,it was a miserable machine an inefficient machine she thought the human apparatus for painting or for feeling it always broke down at the critical moment heroically one must force it on
3107,she stared frowning
3108,there was the hedge sure enough
3109,but one got nothing by soliciting urgently
3110,one got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the wall or from thinking   ”she wore a grey hat
3111,she was astonishingly beautiful
3112,let it come she thought if it will come
3113,for there are moments when one can neither think nor feel
3114,and if one can neither think nor feel she thought where is one
3115,here on the grass on the ground she thought sitting down and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains
3116,for the lawn was very rough
3117,here sitting on the world she thought for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time perhaps for the last time as a traveller even though he is half asleep knows looking out of the train window that he must look now for he will never see that town or that mule cart or that woman at work in the fields again
3118,the lawn was the world they were up here together on this exalted station she thought looking at old mr carmichael who seemed though they had not said a word all this time to share her thoughts
3119,and she would never see him again perhaps
3120,he was growing old
3121,also she remembered smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot he was growing famous
3122,people said that his poetry was so beautiful
3123,they went and published things he had written forty years ago
3124,there was a famous man now called carmichael she smiled thinking how many shapes one person might wear how he was that in the newspapers but here the same as he had always been
3125,he looked the same   ”greyer rather
3126,yes he looked the same but somebody had said she recalled that when he had heard of andrew ramsay own death he was killed in a second by a she will he should have been a great mathematician mr carmichael had lost all interest in life
3127,what did it mean   ”that
3128,she wondered
3129,had he marched through trafalgar square grasping a big stick
3130,had he turned pages over and over without reading them sitting in his room in st john own wood alone
3131,she did not know what he had done when he heard that andrew was killed but she felt it in him all the same
3132,they only mumbled at each other on staircases they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it will not be fine
3133,but this was one way of knowing people she thought to know the outline not the detail to sit in one own garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather
3134,she knew him in that way
3135,she knew that he had changed somehow
3136,she had never read a line of his poetry
3137,she thought that she knew how it went though slowly and sonorously
3138,it was seasoned and mellow
3139,it was about the desert and the camel
3140,it was about the palm tree and the sunset
3141,it was extremely impersonal it said something about death it said very little about love
3142,there was an impersonality about him
3143,he wanted very little of other people
3144,had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing room window with some newspaper under his arm trying to avoid mrs ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like
3145,on that account of course she would always try to make him stop
3146,he would bow to her
3147,he would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly
3148,annoyed that he did not want anything of her mrs ramsay would ask him lily could hear her would not he like a coat a rug a newspaper
3149,no he wanted nothing
3150,here he bowed
3151,there was some quality in her which he did not much like
3152,it was perhaps her masterfulness her positiveness something matter of fact in her
3153,she was so direct
3154,a noise drew her attention to the drawing room window   ”the squeak of a hinge the light breeze was toying with the window
3155,there must have been people who disliked her very much lily thought yes she realised that the drawing room step was empty but it had no effect on her whatever she did not want mrs ramsay now   ”people who thought her too sure too drastic
3156,also her beauty offended people probably
3157,how monotonous they would say and the same always
3158,they preferred another type   ”the dark the vivacious
3159,then she was weak with her husband
3160,she let him make those scenes
3161,then she was reserved
3162,nobody knew exactly what had happened to her
3163,and to go back to mr carmichael and his dislike one could not imagine mrs ramsay standing painting lying reading a whole morning on the lawn
3164,it was unthinkable
3165,without saying a word the only token of her errand a basket on her arm she went off to the town to the poor to sit in some stuffy little bedroom
3166,often and often lily had seen her go silently in the midst of some game some discussion with her basket on her arm very upright
3167,she had noted her return
3168,she had thought half laughing she was so methodical with the tea cups half moved her beauty took one own breath away eyes that are closing in pain have looked on you
3169,you have been with them there
3170,and then mrs ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late or the butter not fresh or the teapot chipped
3171,and all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of greek temples and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room
3172,she never talked of it   ”she went punctually directly
3173,it was her instinct to go an instinct like the swallows for the south the artichokes for the sun turning her infallibly to the human race making her nest in its heart
3174,and this like all instincts was a little distressing to people who did not share it to mr carmichael perhaps to herself certainly
3175,some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action the supremacy of thought
3176,her going was a reproach to them gave a different twist to the world so that they were led to protest seeing their own prepossessions disappear and clutch at them vanishing
3177,charles tansley did that too it was part of the reason why one disliked him
3178,he upset the proportions of one own world
3179,and what had happened to him she wondered idly stirring the platains with her brush
3180,he had got his fellowship
3181,he had married he lived at golder own green
3182,she had gone one day into a hall and heard him speaking during the war
3183,he was denouncing something he was condemning somebody
3184,he was preaching brotherly love
3185,and all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another who had stood behind her smoking shag fivepence an ounce miss briscoe and making it his business to tell her women cannot write women cannot paint not so much that he believed it as that for some odd reason he wished it
3186,there he was lean and red and raucous preaching love from a platform there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush   ”red energetic shiny ants rather like charles tansley
3187,she had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half empty hall pumping love into that chilly space and suddenly there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and mrs ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles
3188,oh dear what a nuisance lost again do not bother mr tansley i lose thousands every summer at which he pressed his chin back against his collar as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration but could stand it in her whom he liked and smiled very charmingly
3189,he must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone
3190,he was educating his little sister mrs ramsay had told her
3191,it was immensely to his credit
3192,her own idea of him was grotesque lily knew well stirring the plantains with her brush
3193,half one own notions of other people were after all grotesque
3194,they served private purposes of one own own
3195,he did for her instead of a whipping boy
3196,she found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper
3197,if she wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to mrs ramsay own sayings to look at him through her eyes
3198,she raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over
3199,she reduced them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in their cosmogony
3200,some ran this way others that
3201,one wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with she reflected
3202,fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with she thought
3203,among them must be one that was stone blind to her beauty
3204,one wanted most some secret sense fine as air with which to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting talking sitting silent in the window alone which took to itself and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer her thoughts her imaginations her desires
3205,what did the hedge mean to her what did the garden mean to her what did it mean to her when a wave broke
3206,lily looked up as she had seen mrs ramsay look up she too heard a wave falling on the beach
3207,and then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried how is that how is that cricketing
3208,she would stop knitting for a second
3209,she would look intent
3210,then she would lapse again and suddenly mr ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over her and looked down at her
3211,lily could see him
3212,he stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair
3213,it seemed somehow as if he had done it before as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which lying a few inches off some island had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen
3214,an old fashioned scene that was which required very nearly crinolines and peg top trousers
3215,letting herself be helped by him mrs ramsay had thought lily supposed the time has come now
3216,yes she would say it now
3217,yes she would marry him
3218,and she stepped slowly quietly on shore
3219,probably she said one word only letting her hand rest still in his
3220,i will marry you she might have said with her hand in his but no more
3221,time after time the same thrill had passed between them   ”obviously it had lily thought smoothing a way for her ants
3222,she was not inventing she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up something she had seen
3223,for in the rough and tumble of daily life with all those children about all those visitors one had constantly a sense of repetition   ”of one thing falling where another had fallen and so setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations
3224,but it would be a mistake she thought thinking how they walked off together arm in arm past the greenhouse to simplify their relationship
3225,it was no monotony of bliss   ”she with her impulses and quicknesses he with his shudders and glooms
3226,oh no
3227,the bedroom door would slam violently early in the morning
3228,he would start from the table in a temper
3229,he would whizz his plate through the window
3230,then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and blinds fluttering as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship  shape
3231,she had met paul rayley like that one day on the stairs
3232,they had laughed and laughed like a couple of children all because mr ramsay finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside
3233,an earwig prue murmured awestruck in his milk
3234,other people might find centipedes
3235,but he had built round him such a fence of sanctity and occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig in his milk was a monster
3236,but it tired mrs ramsay it cowed her a little   ”the plates whizzing and the doors slamming
3237,and there would fall between them sometimes long rigid silences when in a state of mind which annoyed lily in her half plaintive half resentful she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly or to laugh as they laughed but in her weariness perhaps concealed something
3238,she brooded and sat silent
3239,after a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was   ”roaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking for she would take care to be busy when he passed and evade him and pretend not to see him
3240,then he would turn smooth as silk affable urbane and try to win her so
3241,still she would hold off and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without would turn her head would look so over her shoulder always with some minta paul or william bankes at her side
3242,at length standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps at the window where she had seen him he would say her name once only for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow but still she held back and he would say it once more and this time something in the tone would rouse her and she would go to him leaving them all of a sudden and they would walk off together among the pear trees the cabbages and the raspberry beds
3243,they would have it out together
3244,but with what attitudes and with what words
3245,such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that turning away she and paul and minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort and begin picking flowers throwing balls chattering until it was time for dinner and there they were he at one end of the table she at the other as usual
3246,why do not some of you take up botany with all those legs and arms why does not one of you
3247,so they would talk as usual laughing among the children
3248,all would be as usual save only for some quiver as of a blade in the air which came and went between them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and the cabbages
3249,especially lily thought mrs ramsay would glance at prue
3250,she sat in the middle between brothers and sisters always occupied it seemed seeing that nothing went wrong so that she scarcely spoke herself
3251,how prue must have blamed herself for that earwig in the milk how white she had gone when mr ramsay threw his plate through the window
3252,how she drooped under those long silences between them
3253,anyhow her mother now would seem to be making it up to her assuring her that everything was well promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be hers
3254,she had enjoyed it for less than a year however
3255,she had let the flowers fall from her basket lily thought screwing up her eyes and standing back as if to look at her picture which she was not touching however with all her faculties in a trance frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed
3256,she let her flowers fall from her basket scattered and tumbled them on to the grass and reluctantly and hesitatingly but without question or complaint   ”had she not the faculty of obedience to perfection
3257,  ”went too
3258,down fields across valleys white flower strewn   ”that was how she would have painted it
3259,the hills were austere
3260,it was rocky it was steep
3261,the waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath
3262,they went the three of them together mrs ramsay walking rather fast in front as if she expected to meet some one round the corner
3263,suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light stuff behind it
3264,at last then somebody had come into the drawing room somebody was sitting in the chair
3265,for heaven own sake she prayed let them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her
3266,mercifully whoever it was stayed still inside had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd shaped triangular shadow over the step
3267,it altered the composition of the picture a little
3268,it was interesting
3269,it might be useful
3270,her mood was coming back to her
3271,one must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion the determination not to be put off not to be bamboozled
3272,one must hold the scene   ”so   ”in a vise and let nothing come in and spoil it
3273,one wanted she thought dipping her brush deliberately to be on a level with ordinary experience to feel simply that is a chair that is a table and yet at the same time it is a miracle it is an ecstasy
3274,the problem might be solved after all
3275,ah but what had happened
3276,some wave of white went over the window pane
3277,the air must have stirred some flounce in the room
3278,her heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her
3279,mrs ramsay mrs ramsay she cried feeling the old horror come back   ”to want and want and not to have
3280,could she inflict that still
3281,and then quietly as if she refrained that too became part of ordinary experience was on a level with the chair with the table
3282,mrs ramsay   ”it was part of her perfect goodness   ”sat there quite simply in the chair flicked her needles to and fro knitted her reddish brown stocking cast her shadow on the step
3283,there she sat
3284,and as if she had something she must share yet could hardly leave her easel so full her mind was of what she was thinking of what she was seeing lily went past mr carmichael holding her brush to the edge of the lawn
3285,where was that boat now
3286,and mr ramsay
3287,she wanted him
3288,mr ramsay had almost done reading
3289,one hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it
3290,he sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about extraordinarily exposed to everything
3291,he looked very old
3292,he looked james thought getting his head now against the lighthouse now against the waste of waters running away into the open like some old stone lying on the sand he looked as if he had become physically what was always at the back of both of their minds   ”that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things
3293,he was reading very quickly as if he were eager to get to the end
3294,indeed they were very close to the lighthouse now
3295,there it loomed up stark and straight glaring white and black and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks
3296,one could see lines and creases in the rocks
3297,one could see the windows clearly a dab of white on one of them and a little tuft of green on the rock
3298,a man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again
3299,so it was like that james thought the lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years it was a stark tower on a bare rock
3300,it satisfied him
3301,it confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character
3302,the old ladies he thought thinking of the garden at home went dragging their chairs about on the lawn
3303,old mrs beckwith for example was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy but as a matter of fact james thought looking at the lighthouse stood there on its rock it is like that
3304,he looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight
3305,they shared that knowledge
3306,we are driving before a gale   ”we must sink he began saying to himself half aloud exactly as his father said it
3307,nobody seemed to have spoken for an age
3308,cam was tired of looking at the sea
3309,little bits of black cork had floated past the fish were dead in the bottom of the boat
3310,still her father read and james looked at him and she looked at him and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought
3311,it was thus that he escaped she thought
3312,yes with his great forehead and his great nose holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him he escaped
3313,you might try to lay hands on him but then like a bird he spread his wings he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump
3314,she gazed at the immense expanse of the sea
3315,the island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer
3316,it looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover
3317,yet in its frailty were all those paths those terraces those bedrooms   ” all those innumberable things
3318,but as just before sleep things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself so she felt looking drowsily at the island all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind
3319,it was a hanging garden it was a valley full of birds and flowers and antelopesshe was falling asleep
3320,come now said mr ramsay suddenly shutting his book
3321,come where
3322,to what extraordinary adventure
3323,she woke with a start
3324,to land somewhere to climb somewhere
3325,where was he leading them
3326,for after his immense silence the words startled them
3327,but it was absurd
3328,he was hungry he said
3329,it was time for lunch
3330,besides look he said
3331,there is the lighthouse we are almost there
3332,he is doing very well said macalister praising james
3333,he is keeping her very steady
3334,but his father never praised him james thought grimly
3335,mr ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them
3336,now he was happy eating bread and cheese with these fishermen
3337,he would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour spitting with the other old men james thought watching him slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife
3338,this is right this is it cam kept feeling as she peeled her hard  boiled egg
3339,now she felt as she did in the study when the old men were reading the times
3340,now i can go on thinking whatever i like and i shall not fall over a precipice or be drowned for there he is keeping his eye on me she thought
3341,at the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it was very exciting   ”it seemed as if they were doing two things at once they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck
3342,would the water last
3343,would the provisions last
3344,she asked herself telling herself a story but knowing at the same time what was the truth
3345,they would soon be out of it mr ramsay was saying to old macalister but their children would see some strange things
3346,macalister said he was seventy five last march mr ramsay was seventy one
3347,macalister said he had never seen a doctor he had never lost a tooth
3348,and that is the way I would like my children to live   ”cam was sure that her father was thinking that for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel
3349,she should not waste it
3350,he said it so wisely as if he knew so well all the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once and then he gave her from his own parcel a gingerbread nut as if he were a great spanish gentleman she thought handing a flower to a lady at a window so courteous his manner was
3351,he was shabby and simple eating bread and cheese and yet he was leading them on a great expedition where for all she knew they would be drowned
3352,that was where she sunk said macalister own boy suddenly
3353,three men were drowned where we are now the old man said
3354,he had seen them clinging to the mast himself
3355,and mr ramsay taking a look at the spot was about james and cam were afraid to burst out
3356,but i beneath a rougher sea
3357,and if he did they could not bear it they would shriek aloud they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him but to their surprise all he said was ah as if he thought to himself
3358,but why make a fuss about that
3359,naturally men are drowned in a storm but it is a perfectly straightforward affair and the depths of the sea he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them are only water after all
3360,then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch
3361,he looked at it attentively he made perhaps some mathematical calculation
3362,at last he said triumphantly
3363,well done
3364,james had steered them like a born sailor
3365,there
3366,cam thought addressing herself silently to james
3367,you have got it at last
3368,for she knew that this was what james had been wanting and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not look at her or at his father or at any one
3369,there he sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright looking rather sulky and frowning slightly
3370,he was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure
3371,his father had praised him
3372,they must think that he was perfectly indifferent
3373,but you have got it now cam thought
3374,they had tacked and they were sailing swiftly buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef
3375,on the left a row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and became greener and on one a higher rock a wave incessantly broke and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower
3376,one could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever
3377,now they could see two men on the lighthouse watching them and making ready to meet them
3378,mr ramsay buttoned his coat and turned up his trousers
3379,he took the large badly packed brown paper parcel which nancy had got ready and sat with it on his knee
3380,thus in complete readiness to land he sat looking back at the island
3381,with his long sighted eyes perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf like shape standing on end on a plate of gold quite clearly
3382,what could he see
3383,cam wondered
3384,it was all a blur to her
3385,what was he thinking now
3386,she wondered
3387,what was it he sought so fixedly so intently so silently
3388,they watched him both of them sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away
3389,what do you want
3390,they both wanted to ask
3391,they both wanted to say ask us anything and we will give it you
3392,but he did not ask them anything
3393,he sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking we perished each alone or he might be thinking i have reached it
3394,i have found it but he said nothing
3395,then he put on his hat
3396,bring those parcels he said nodding his head at the things nancy had done up for them to take to the lighthouse
3397,the parcels for the lighthouse men he said
3398,he rose and stood in the bow of the boat very straight and tall for all the world james thought as if he were saying there is no god and cam thought as if he were leaping into space and they both rose to follow him as he sprang lightly like a young man holding his parcel on to the rock
3399,he must have reached it said lily briscoe aloud feeling suddenly completely tired out
3400,for the lighthouse had become almost invisible had melted away into a blue haze and the effort of looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there which both seemed to be one and the same effort had stretched her body and mind to the utmost
3401,ah but she was relieved
3402,whatever she had wanted to give him when he left her that morning she had given him at last
3403,he has landed she said aloud
3404,it is finished
3405,then surging up puffing slightly old mr carmichael stood beside her looking like an old pagan god shaggy with weeds in his hair and the trident it was only a french novel in his hand
3406,he stood by her on the edge of the lawn swaying a little in his bulk and said shading his eyes with his hand they will have landed and she felt that she had been right
3407,they had not needed to speak
3408,they had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything
3409,he stood there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind she thought he was surveying tolerantly and compassionately their final destiny
3410,now he has crowned the occasion she thought when his hand slowly fell as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which fluttering slowly lay at length upon the earth
3411,quickly as if she were recalled by something over there she turned to her canvas
3412,there it was   ”her picture
3413,yes with all its greens and blues its lines running up and across its attempt at something
3414,it would be hung in the attics she thought it would be destroyed
3415,but what did that matter
3416,she asked herself taking up her brush again
3417,she looked at the steps they were empty she looked at her canvas it was blurred
3418,with a sudden intensity as if she saw it clear for a second she drew a line there in the centre
3419,it was done it was finished
3420,yes she thought laying down her brush in extreme fatigue i have had my vision
