747,747,139,0,9,""" And where were they now? Mrs. Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she be told? If nothing happened, she would have to speak seriously to Minta. For she could not go trapesing about all over the country, even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them). She was responsible to Minta's parents - ”the Owl and the Poker. Her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read. The Owl and the Poker - ”yes, they would be annoyed if they heard - ”and they were certain to hear - ”that Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. ""He wore a wig in the House of Commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs,"" she repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband. Dear, dear, Mrs. Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking? How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits - ”interesting perhaps, but limited after all - ”of that bird? Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her husband that night, coming back from the party). However, Minta came...Yes, she came, Mrs. Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a woman had once accused her of ""robbing her of her daughter's affections""; something Mrs. Doyle had said made her remember that charge again. Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wished - ”that was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. How could she help being ""like that"" to look at?", and where were they now mrs ramsay wondered reading and thinking quite easily both at the same time for the story of the fisherman and his wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody and when should she be told if nothing happened she would have to speak seriously to minta for she could not go trapesing about all over the country even if nancy were with them she tried again unsuccessfully to visualize their backs going down the path and to count them she was responsible to minta own parents   ”the owl and the poker her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read the owl and the poker   ”yes they would be annoyed if they heard   ”and they were certain to hear   ”that minta staying with the ramsays had been seen etcetera etcetera etcetera he wore a wig in the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs she repeated fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which coming back from some party she had made to amuse her husband dear dear mrs ramsay said to herself how did they produce this incongruous daughter this tomboy minta with a hole in her stocking how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust pan the sand that the parrot had scattered and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits   ”interesting perhaps but limited after all   ”of that bird naturally one had asked her to lunch tea dinner finally to stay with them up at finlay which had resulted in some friction with the owl her mother and more calling and more conversation and more sand and really at the end of it she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime so she had said to her husband that night coming back from the party however minta cameyes she came mrs ramsay thought suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought and disengaging it found it to be this a woman had once accused her of robbing her of her daughter own affections something mrs doyle had said made her remember that charge again wishing to dominate wishing to interfere making people do what she wished   ”that was the charge against her and she thought it most unjust how could she help being like that to look at,414,2320,2.220446049250313e-16,-0.04175737494821853,2.337311630789803e-16,1.2048756373934303e-17,0.7999999999999998,-0.021588633994662165,1.0,0.04554346312009059,-85.39872554291311,-0.04576204282909681,-4.482148046890585,-0.8096393608107577,10.860000000000012,0.11113748041186045,7.896017699115052,0.1565642087381221,7.354166666666668,0.23869619656451974,11.170886075949374,0.43672675857193366,24.959649647220996,0.0006866874247119705,3.3185942994207287,0.2510757496054389,1.6324222636812722,0.035607544121822515,4.583923665813922,0.34659363179291197,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.8297}",0.8297,-0.0010373266476705798,2.118743615934627,0.1504778653786299,0.16804820693709582,-0.1266435979943664,1.2803672909493014,0.10006651263740111,0.7517233826890309,-0.06265232273300869,7.122885375530236,0.473973319326399,66.92931281093216,-0.5159857604471488,14.377450225699542,-1.0599631591777674
