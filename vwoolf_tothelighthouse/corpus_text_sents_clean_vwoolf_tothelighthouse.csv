0, yes  of course  if it is fine tomorrow   said mrs  ramsay 
1, but you will have to be up with the lark   she added 
2,to her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy  as if it were settled  the expedition were bound to take place  and the wonder to which he had looked forward  for years and years it seemed  was  after a night own darkness and a day own sail  within touch 
3,since he belonged  even at the age of six  to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that  but must let future prospects  with their joys and sorrows  cloud what is actually at hand  since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests  james ramsay  sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the army and navy stores  endowed the picture of a refrigerator  as his mother spoke  with heavenly bliss 
4,it was fringed with joy 
5,the wheelbarrow  the lawnmower  the sound of poplar trees  leaves whitening before rain  rooks cawing  brooms knocking  dresses rustling   all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code  his secret language  though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity  with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes  impeccably candid and pure  frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty  so that his mother  watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator  imagined him all red and ermine on the bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs 
6, but   said his father  stopping in front of the drawing room window   it will not be fine  
7,had there been an axe handy  a poker  or any weapon that would have gashed a hole in his father own breast and killed him  there and then  james would have seized it 
8,such were the extremes of emotion that mr  ramsay excited in his children own breasts by his mere presence  standing  as now  lean as a knife  narrow as the blade of one  grinning sarcastically  not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife  who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was  james thought   but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement 
9,what he said was true 
10,it was always true 
11,he was incapable of untruth  never tampered with a fact  never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being  least of all of his own children  who  sprung from his loins  should be aware from childhood that life is difficult  facts uncompromising  and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished  our frail barks founder in darkness  here mr  ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon   one that needs  above all  courage  truth  and the power to endure 
12, but it may be fine   i expect it will be fine   said mrs  ramsay  making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting  impatiently 
13,if she finished it tonight  if they did go to the lighthouse after all  it was to be given to the lighthouse keeper for his little boy  who was threatened with a tuberculous hip  together with a pile of old magazines  and some tobacco  indeed  whatever she could find lying about  not really wanted  but only littering the room  to give those poor fellows  who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden  something to amuse them 
14,for how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time  and possibly more in stormy weather  upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn 
15,she would ask  and to have no letters or newspapers  and to see nobody  if you were married  not to see your wife  not to know how your children were    if they were ill  if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms  to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week  and then a dreadful storm coming  and the windows covered with spray  and birds dashed against the lamp  and the whole place rocking  and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea 
16,how would you like that 
17,she asked  addressing herself particularly to her daughters 
18,so she added  rather differently  one must take them whatever comforts one can 
19, it is due west   said the atheist tansley  holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them  for he was sharing mr  ramsay own evening walk up and down  up and down the terrace 
20,that is to say  the wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the lighthouse 
21,yes  he did say disagreeable things  mrs  ramsay admitted  it was odious of him to rub this in  and make james still more disappointed  but at the same time  she would not let them laugh at him 
22, the atheist   they called him   the little atheist  
23,rose mocked him  prue mocked him  andrew  jasper  roger mocked him  even old badger without a tooth in his head had bit him  for being  as nancy put it  the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone 
24, nonsense   said mrs  ramsay  with great severity 
25,apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her  and from the implication  which was true  that she asked too many people to stay  and had to lodge some in the town  she could not bear incivility to her guests  to young men in particular  who were poor as churchmice   exceptionally able   her husband said  his great admirers  and come there for a holiday 
26,indeed  she had the whole of the other sex under her protection  for reasons she could not explain  for their chivalry and valour  for the fact that they negotiated treaties  ruled india  controlled finance  finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable  something trustful  childlike  reverential  which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity  and woe betide the girl   pray heaven it was none of her daughters 
27,  who did not feel the worth of it  and all that it implied  to the marrow of her bones 
28,she turned with severity upon nancy 
29,he had not chased them  she said 
30,he had been asked 
31,they must find a way out of it all 
32,there might be some simpler way  some less laborious way  she sighed 
33,when she looked in the glass and saw her hair grey  her cheek sunk  at fifty  she thought  possibly she might have managed things better   her husband  money  his books 
34,but for her own part she would never for a single second regret her decision  evade difficulties  or slur over duties 
35,she was now formidable to behold  and it was only in silence  looking up from their plates  after she had spoken so severely about charles tansley  that her daughters  prue  nancy  rose   could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers  in paris  perhaps  a wilder life  not always taking care of some man or other  for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry  of the bank of england and the indian empire  of ringed fingers and lace  though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty  which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts  and made them  as they sat at table beneath their mother own eyes  honour her strange severity  her extreme courtesy  like a queen own raising from the mud to wash a beggar own dirty foot  when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them   or  speaking accurately  been invited to stay with them   in the isle of skye 
36, there will be no landing at the lighthouse tomorrow   said charles tansley  clapping his hands together as he stood at the window with her husband 
37,surely  he had said enough 
38,she wished they would both leave her and james alone and go on talking 
39,she looked at him 
40,he was such a miserable specimen  the children said  all humps and hollows 
41,he could not play cricket  he poked  he shuffled 
42,he was a sarcastic brute  andrew said 
43,they knew what he liked best   to be for ever walking up and down  up and down  with mr  ramsay  and saying who had won this  who had won that  who was a  first rate man  at latin verses  who was  brilliant but i think fundamentally unsound   who was undoubtedly the  ablest fellow in balliol   who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford  but was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena  of which mr  tansley had the first pages in proof with him if mr  ramsay would like to see them  to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day 
44,that was what they talked about 
45,she could not help laughing herself sometimes 
46,she said  the other day  something about  waves mountains high  
47,yes  said charles tansley  it was a little rough 
48, are not you drenched to the skin   she had said 
49, damp  not wet through   said mr  tansley  pinching his sleeve  feeling his socks 
50,but it was not that they minded  the children said 
51,it was not his face  it was not his manners 
52,it was him   his point of view 
53,when they talked about something interesting  people  music  history  anything  even said it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors  then what they complained of about charles tansley was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them   he was not satisfied 
54,and he would go to picture galleries they said  and he would ask one  did one like his tie 
55,god knows  said rose  one did not 
56,disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner table directly the meal was over  the eight sons and daughters of mr  and mrs  ramsay sought their bedrooms  their fastness in a house where there was no other privacy to debate anything  everything  tansley own tie  the passing of the reform bill  sea birds and butterflies  people  while the sun poured into those attics  which a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep could be plainly heard and the swiss girl sobbing for her father who was dying of cancer in a valley of the grisons  and lit up bats  flannels  straw hats  ink pots  paint pots  beetles  and the skulls of small birds  while it drew from the long frilled strips of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds  which was in the towels too  gritty with sand from bathing 
57,strife  divisions  difference of opinion  prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being  oh  that they should begin so early  mrs  ramsay deplored 
58,they were so critical  her children 
59,they talked such nonsense 
60,she went from the dining room  holding james by the hand  since he would not go with the others 
61,it seemed to her such nonsense   inventing differences  when people  heaven knows  were different enough without that 
62,the real differences  she thought  standing by the drawing room window  are enough  quite enough 
63,she had in mind at the moment  rich and poor  high and low  the great in birth receiving from her  half grudging  some respect  for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble  if slightly mythical  italian house  whose daughters  scattered about english drawing rooms in the nineteenth century  had lisped so charmingly  had stormed so wildly  and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them  and not from the sluggish english  or the cold scotch  but more profoundly  she ruminated the other problem  of rich and poor  and the things she saw with her own eyes  weekly  daily  here or in london  when she visited this widow  or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm  and a note book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings  employment and unemployment  in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation  half a relief to her own curiosity  and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired  an investigator  elucidating the social problem 
64,insoluble questions they were  it seemed to her  standing there  holding james by the hand 
65,he had followed her into the drawing room  that young man they laughed at  he was standing by the table  fidgeting with something  awkwardly  feeling himself out of things  as she knew without looking round 
66,they had all gone   the children  minta doyle and paul rayley  augustus carmichael  her husband   they had all gone 
67,so she turned with a sigh and said   would it bore you to come with me  mr  tansley  
68,she had a dull errand in the town  she had a letter or two to write  she would be ten minutes perhaps  she would put on her hat 
69,and  with her basket and her parasol  there she was again  ten minutes later  giving out a sense of being ready  of being equipped for a jaunt  which  however  she must interrupt for a moment  as they passed the tennis lawn  to ask mr  carmichael  who was basking with his yellow cat own eyes ajar  so that like a cat own they seemed to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing  but to give no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever  if he wanted anything 
70,for they were making the great expedition  she said  laughing 
71,they were going to the town 
72, stamps  writing paper  tobacco   she suggested  stopping by his side 
73,but no  he wanted nothing 
74,his hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch  his eyes blinked  as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments  she was seductive but a little nervous  but could not  sunk as he was in a grey green somnolence which embraced them all  without need of words  in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well wishing  all the house  all the world  all the people in it  for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something  which accounted  the children thought  for the vivid streak of canary yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white 
75,no  nothing  he murmured 
76,he should have been a great philosopher  said mrs  ramsay  as they went down the road to the fishing village  but he had made an unfortunate marriage 
77,holding her black parasol very erect  and moving with an indescribable air of expectation  as if she were going to meet some one round the corner  she told the story  an affair at oxford with some girl  an early marriage  poverty  going to india  translating a little poetry  very beautifully  i believe   being willing to teach the boys persian or hindustanee  but what really was the use of that 
78,  and then lying  as they saw him  on the lawn 
79,it flattered him  snubbed as he had been  it soothed him that mrs  ramsay should tell him this 
80,charles tansley revived 
81,insinuating  too  as she did the greatness of man own intellect  even in its decay  the subjection of all wives   not that she blamed the girl  and the marriage had been happy enough  she believed   to their husband own labours  she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet  and he would have liked  had they taken a cab  for example  to have paid the fare 
82,as for her little bag  might he not carry that 
83,no  no  she said  she always carried that herself 
84,she did too 
85,yes  he felt that in her 
86,he felt many things  something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give 
87,he would like her to see him  gowned and hooded  walking in a procession 
88,a fellowship  a professorship  he felt capable of anything and saw himself   but what was she looking at 
89,at a man pasting a bill 
90,the vast flapping sheet flattened itself out  and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs  hoops  horses  glistening reds and blues  beautifully smooth  until half the wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus  a hundred horsemen  twenty performing seals  lions  tigers   craning forwards  for she was short sighted  she read it out    will visit this town   she read 
91,it was terribly dangerous work for a one armed man  she exclaimed  to stand on top of a ladder like that   his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago 
92, let us all go   she cried  moving on  as if all those riders and horses had filled her with childlike exultation and made her forget her pity 
93, let us go   he said  repeating her words  clicking them out  however  with a self consciousness that made her wince 
94, let us all go to the circus  
95,he could not say it right 
96,he could not feel it right 
97,but why not 
98,she wondered 
99,what was wrong with him then 
100,she liked him warmly  at the moment 
101,had they not been taken  she asked  to circuses when they were children 
102,never  he answered  as if she asked the very thing he wanted  had been longing all these days to say  how they did not go to circuses 
103,it was a large family  nine brothers and sisters  and his father was a working man 
104, my father is a chemist  mrs  ramsay  he keeps a shop  
105,he himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen 
106,often he went without a greatcoat in winter 
107,he could never  return hospitality   those were his parched stiff words  at college 
108,he had to make things last twice the time other people did  he smoked the cheapest tobacco  shag  the same the old men did in the quays 
109,he worked hard   seven hours a day  his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody   they were walking on and mrs  ramsay did not quite catch the meaning  only the words  here and there   dissertation   fellowship   readership   lectureship 
110,she could not follow the ugly academic jargon  that rattled itself off so glibly  but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch  poor little man  and why he came out  instantly  with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters  and she would see to it that they did not laugh at him any more  she would tell prue about it 
111,what he would have liked  she supposed  would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with the ramsays 
112,he was an awful prig   oh yes  an insufferable bore 
113,for  though they had reached the town now and were in the main street  with carts grinding past on the cobbles  still he went on talking  about settlements  and teaching  and working men  and helping our own class  and lectures  till she gathered that he had got back entire self confidence  had recovered from the circus  and was about  and now again she liked him warmly  to tell her   but here  the houses falling away on both sides  they came out on the quay  and the whole bay spread before them and mrs  ramsay could not help exclaiming   oh  how beautiful  
114,for the great plateful of blue water was before her  the hoary lighthouse  distant  austere  in the midst  and on the right  as far as the eye could see  fading and falling  in soft low pleats  the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them  which always seemed to be running away into some moon country  uninhabited of men 
115,that was the view  she said  stopping  growing greyer eyed  that her husband loved 
116,she paused a moment 
117,but now  she said  artists had come here 
118,there indeed  only a few paces off  stood one of them  in panama hat and yellow boots  seriously  softly  absorbedly  for all that he was watched by ten little boys  with an air of profound contentment on his round red face gazing  and then  when he had gazed  dipping  imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink 
119,since mr  paunceforte had been there  three years before  all the pictures were like that  she said  green and grey  with lemon coloured sailing boats  and pink women on the beach 
120,but her grandmother own friends  she said  glancing discreetly as they passed  took the greatest pains  first they mixed their own colours  and then they ground them  and then they put damp cloths to keep them moist 
121,so mr  tansley supposed she meant him to see that that man own picture was skimpy  was that what one said 
122,the colours were not solid 
123,was that what one said 
124,under the influence of that extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk  had begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag  had increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything about himself  he was coming to see himself  and everything he had ever known gone crooked a little 
125,it was awfully strange 
126,there he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him  waiting for her  while she went upstairs a moment to see a woman 
127,he heard her quick step above  heard her voice cheerful  then low  looked at the mats  tea caddies  glass shades  waited quite impatiently  looked forward eagerly to the walk home  determined to carry her bag  then heard her come out  shut a door  say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut  ask at the house for anything they wanted  she must be talking to a child  when  suddenly  in she came  stood for a moment silent  as if she had been pretending up there  and for a moment let herself be now   stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of queen victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the garter  when all at once he realised that it was this  it was this    she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen 
128,with stars in her eyes and veils in her hair  with cyclamen and wild violets   what nonsense was he thinking 
129,she was fifty at least  she had eight children 
130,stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen  with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair   he had hold of her bag 
131, good bye  elsie   she said  and they walked up the street  she holding her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner  while for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride  a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked at her  let his arm fall down and looked at her  for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride  felt the wind and the cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman 
132,he had hold of her bag 
133, no going to the lighthouse  james   he said  as trying in deference to mrs  ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least 
134,odious little man  thought mrs  ramsay  why go on saying that 
135, perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing   she said compassionately  smoothing the little boy own hair  for her husband  with his caustic saying that it would not be fine  had dashed his spirits she could see 
136,this going to the lighthouse was a passion of his  she saw  and then  as if her husband had not said enough  with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow  this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again 
137, perhaps it will be fine tomorrow   she said  smoothing his hair 
138,all she could do now was to admire the refrigerator  and turn the pages of the stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake  or a mowing machine  which  with its prongs and its handles  would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out 
139,all these young men parodied her husband  she reflected  he said it would rain  they said it would be a positive tornado 
140,but here  as she turned the page  suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing machine was interrupted 
141,the gruff murmur  irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her  though she could not hear what was said  as she sat in the window which opened on the terrace   that the men were happily talking  this sound  which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her  such as the tap of balls upon bats  the sharp  sudden bark now and then   how is that  how is that   of the children playing cricket  had ceased  so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach  which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song  murmured by nature   i am guarding you   i am your support   but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly  especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand  had no such kindly meaning  but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life  made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea  and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as a rainbow   this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror 
142,they had ceased to talk  that was the explanation 
143,falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which  as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion  was cool  amused  and even faintly malicious  she concluded that poor charles tansley had been she would 
144,that was of little account to her 
145,if her husband required sacrifices  and indeed he did  she cheerfully offered up to him charles tansley  who had snubbed her little boy 
146,one moment more  with her head raised  she listened  as if she waited for some habitual sound  some regular mechanical sound  and then  hearing something rhythmical  half said  half chanted  beginning in the garden  as her husband beat up and down the terrace  something between a croak and a song  she was soothed once more  assured again that all was well  and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if james was very careful 
147,suddenly a loud cry  as of a sleep walker  half roused  something about
148,stormed at with shot and she will
149,sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear  made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him 
150,only lily briscoe  she was glad to find  and that did not matter 
151,but the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her  she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily own picture 
152,lily own picture 
153,mrs  ramsay smiled 
154,with her little chinese eyes and her puckered up face  she would never marry  one could not take her painting very seriously  she was an independent little creature  and mrs  ramsay liked her for it  so  remembering her promise  she bent her head 
155,indeed  he almost knocked her easel over  coming down upon her with his hands waving shouting out   boldly we rode and well   but  mercifully  he turned sharp  and rode off  to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of balaclava 
156,never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so alarming 
157,but so long as he kept like that  waving  shouting  she was safe  he would not stand still and look at her picture 
158,and that was what lily briscoe could not have endured 
159,even while she looked at the mass  at the line  at the colour  at mrs  ramsay sitting in the window with james  she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up  and suddenly she should find her picture looked at 
160,but now  with all her senses quickened as they were  looking  straining  till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes  she was aware of someone coming out of the house  coming towards her  but somehow divined  from the footfall  william bankes  so that though her brush quivered  she did not  as she would have done had it been mr  tansley  paul rayley  minta doyle  or practically anybody else  turn her canvas upon the grass  but let it stand 
161,william bankes stood beside her 
162,they had rooms in the village  and so  walking in  walking out  parting late on door mats  had said little things about the soup  about the children  about one thing and another which made them allies  so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way  he was old enough to be her father too  a botanist  a widower  smelling of soap  very scrupulous and clean  she just stood there 
163,he just stood there 
164,her shoes were excellent  he observed 
165,they allowed the toes their natural expansion 
166,lodging in the same house with her  he had noticed too  how orderly she was  up before breakfast and off to paint  he believed  alone  poor  presumably  and without the complexion or the allurement of miss doyle certainly  but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady 
167,now  for instance  when ramsay bore down on them  shouting  gesticulating  miss briscoe  he felt certain  understood 
168,some one had blundered 
169,mr  ramsay glared at them 
170,he glared at them without seeming to see them 
171,that did make them both vaguely uncomfortable 
172,together they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see 
173,they had encroached upon a privacy 
174,so  lily thought  it was probably an excuse of his for moving  for getting out of earshot  that made mr  bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll 
175,she would come  yes 
176,but it was with difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture 
177,the jacmanna was bright violet  the wall staring white 
178,she would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white  since she saw them like that  fashionable though it was  since mr  paunceforte own visit  to see everything pale  elegant  semitransparent 
179,then beneath the colour there was the shape 
180,she could see it all so clearly  so commandingly  when she looked  it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed 
181,it was in that moment own flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child 
182,such she often felt herself   struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage  to say   but this is what i see  this is what i see   and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast  which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her 
183,and it was then too  in that chill and windy way  as she began to paint  that there forced themselves upon her other things  her own inadequacy  her insignificance  keeping house for her father off the brompton road  and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself  thank heaven she had always resisted so far  at mrs  ramsay own knee and say to her   but what could one say to her 
184, I am in love with you  
185,no  that was not true 
186, I am in love with this all   waving her hand at the hedge  at the house  at the children 
187,it was absurd  it was impossible 
188,so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box  side by side  and said to william bankes 
189, it suddenly gets cold  the sun seems to give less heat   she said  looking about her  for it was bright enough  the grass still a soft deep green  the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers  and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue 
190,but something moved  flashed  turned a silver wing in the air 
191,it was september after all  the middle of september  and past six in the evening 
192,so off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction  past the tennis lawn  past the pampas grass  to that break in the thick hedge  guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal  between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever 
193,they came there regularly every evening drawn by some need 
194,it was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land  and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief 
195,first  the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue  and the heart expanded with it and the body swam  only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves 
196,then  up behind the great black rock  almost every evening spurted irregularly  so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came  a fountain of white water  and then  while one waited for that  one watched  on the pale semicircular beach  wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly  a film of mother of pearl 
197,they both smiled  standing there 
198,they both felt a common hilarity  excited by the moving waves  and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat  which  having sliced a curve in the bay  stopped  shivered  let its sails drop down  and then  with a natural instinct to complete the picture  after this swift movement  both of them looked at the dunes far away  and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness   because the thing was completed partly  and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years  lily thought  the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest 
199,looking at the far sand hills  william bankes thought of ramsay  thought of a road in westmorland  thought of ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air 
200,but this was suddenly interrupted  william bankes remembered  and this must refer to some actual incident   by a hen  straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks  upon which ramsay  stopping  pointed his stick and said  pretty   pretty   an odd illumination in to his heart  bankes had thought it  which showed his simplicity  his sympathy with humble things  but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased  there  on that stretch of road 
201,after that  ramsay had married 
202,after that  what with one thing and another  the pulp had gone out of their friendship 
203,whose fault it was he could not say  only  after a time  repetition had taken the place of newness 
204,it was to repeat that they met 
205,but in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for ramsay had in no way diminished  but there  like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century  with the red fresh on his lips  was his friendship  in its acuteness and reality  laid up across the bay among the sandhills 
206,he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk   for ramsay lived in a welter of children  whereas bankes was childless and a widower   he was anxious that lily briscoe should not disparage ramsay  a great man in his own way  yet should understand how things stood between them 
207,begun long years ago  their friendship had petered out on a westmorland road  where the hen spread her wings before her chicks  after which ramsay had married  and their paths lying different ways  there had been  certainly for no one own fault  some tendency  when they met  to repeat 
208,yes 
209,that was it 
210,he finished 
211,he turned from the view 
212,and  turning to walk back the other way  up the drive  mr  bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat   for instance  cam  the little girl  ramsay own youngest daughter 
213,she was picking sweet alice on the bank 
214,she was wild and fierce 
215,she would not  give a flower to the gentleman  as the nursemaid told her 
216,no  no  no  she would not 
217,she clenched her fist 
218,she stamped 
219,and mr  bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship 
220,he must have dried and shrunk 
221,the ramsays were not rich  and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all 
222,eight children 
223,to feed eight children on philosophy 
224,here was another of them  jasper this time  strolling past  to have a shot at a bird  he said  nonchalantly  swinging lily own hand like a pump handle as he passed  which caused mr  bankes to say  bitterly  how she was a favourite 
225,there was education now to be considered  true  mrs  ramsay had something of her own perhaps  let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those  great fellows   all well grown  angular  ruthless youngsters  must require 
226,as for being sure which was which  or in what order they came  that was beyond him 
227,he called them privately after the kings and queens of england  cam the wicked  james the ruthless  andrew the just  prue the fair   for prue would have beauty  he thought  how could she help it 
228,  and andrew brains 
229,while he walked up the drive and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments  for she was in love with them all  in love with this world  he weighed ramsay own case  commiserated him  envied him  as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities 
230,they gave him something   william bankes acknowledged that  it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder  as over her father own  to look at a picture of vesuvius in eruption  but they had also  his old friends could not but feel  destroyed something 
231,what would a stranger think now 
232,what did this lily briscoe think 
233,could one help noticing that habits grew on him 
234,eccentricities  weaknesses perhaps 
235,it was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did   but that was too harsh a phrase   could depend so much as he did upon people own praise 
236, oh  but   said lily   think of his work  
237,whenever she  thought of his work  she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table 
238,it was andrew own doing 
239,she asked him what his father own books were about 
240, subject and object and the nature of reality   andrew had said 
241,and when she said heavens  she had no notion what that meant 
242, think of a kitchen table then   he told her   when you are not there  
243,so now she always saw  when she thought of mr  ramsay own work  a scrubbed kitchen table 
244,it lodged now in the fork of a pear tree  for they had reached the orchard 
245,and with a painful effort of concentration  she focused her mind  not upon the silver bossed bark of the tree  or upon its fish shaped leaves  but upon a phantom kitchen table  one of those scrubbed board tables  grained and knotted  whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity  which stuck there  its four legs in air 
246,naturally  if one own days were passed in this seeing of angular essences  this reducing of lovely evenings  with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four legged table  and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so   naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person 
247,mr  bankes liked her for bidding him  think of his work  
248,he had thought of it  often and often 
249,times without number  he had said   ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty  
250,he had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was only five and twenty  what came after was more or less amplification  repetition 
251,but the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small  he said  pausing by the pear tree  well brushed  scrupulously exact  exquisitely judicial 
252,suddenly  as if the movement of his hand had released it  the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up  and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him 
253,that was one sensation 
254,then up rose in a fume the essence of his being 
255,that was another 
256,she felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception  it was his severity  his goodness 
257,i respect you  she addressed silently him in person  in every atom  you are not vain  you are entirely impersonal  you are finer than mr  ramsay  you are the finest human being that i know  you have neither wife nor child  without any sexual feeling  she longed to cherish that loneliness   you live for science  involuntarily  sections of potatoes rose before her eyes   praise would be an insult to you  generous  pure hearted  heroic man 
258,but simultaneously  she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here  objected to dogs on chairs  would prose for hours  until mr  ramsay slammed out of the room  about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of english cooks 
259,how then did it work out  all this 
260,how did one judge people  think of them 
261,how did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking 
262,and to those words  what meaning attached  after all 
263,standing now  apparently transfixed  by the pear tree  impressions poured in upon her of those two men  and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one own pencil  and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable  everlasting  contradictory things  so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity 
264,you have greatness  she continued  but mr  ramsay has none of it 
265,he is petty  selfish  vain  egotistical  he is spoilt  he is a tyrant  he wears mrs  ramsay to death  but he has what you  she addressed mr  bankes  have not  a fiery unworldliness  he knows nothing about trifles  he loves dogs and his children 
266,he has eight 
267,mr  bankes has none 
268,did he not come down in two coats the other night and let mrs  ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin 
269,all of this danced up and down  like a company of gnats  each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net   danced up and down in lily own mind  in and about the branches of the pear tree  where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table  symbol of her profound respect for mr  ramsay own mind  until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity  she felt released  a shot went off close at hand  and there came  flying from its fragments  frightened  effusive  tumultuous  a flock of starlings 
270, jasper   said mr  bankes 
271,they turned the way the starlings flew  over the terrace 
272,following the scatter of swift flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into mr  ramsay  who boomed tragically at them   some one had blundered  
273,his eyes  glazed with emotion  defiant with tragic intensity  met theirs for a second  and trembled on the verge of recognition  but then  raising his hand  half way to his face as if to avert  to brush off  in an agony of peevish shame  their normal gaze  as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable  as if he impressed upon them his own child like resentment of interruption  yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly  but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion  this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed  but in which he revelled   he turned abruptly  slammed his private door on them  and  lily briscoe and mr  bankes  looking uneasily up into the sky  observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees 
274, and even if it is not fine tomorrow   said mrs  ramsay  raising her eyes to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed   it will be another day  and now   she said  thinking that lily own charm was her chinese eyes  aslant in her white  puckered little face  but it would take a clever man to see it   and now stand up  and let me measure your leg   for they might go to the lighthouse after all  and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg 
275,smiling  for it was an admirable idea  that had flashed upon her this very second   william and lily should marry   she took the heather mixture stocking  with its criss cross of steel needles at the mouth of it  and measured it against james own leg 
276, my dear  stand still   she said  for in his jealousy  not liking to serve as measuring block for the lighthouse keeper own little boy  james fidgeted purposely  and if he did that  how could she see  was it too long  was it too short 
277,she asked 
278,she looked up   what demon possessed him  her youngest  her cherished 
279,  and saw the room  saw the chairs  thought them fearfully shabby 
280,their entrails  as andrew said the other day  were all over the floor  but then what was the point  she asked  of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house  with only one old woman to see to it  positively dripped with wet 
281,never mind  the rent was precisely twopence half penny  the children loved it  it did her husband good to be three thousand  or if she must be accurate  three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples  and there was room for visitors 
282,mats  camp beds  crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose london life of service was done   they did well enough here  and a photograph or two  and books 
283,books  she thought  grew of themselves 
284,she never had time to read them 
285,alas  even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself   for her whose wishes must be obeyed     the happier helen of our days    disgraceful to say  she had never read them 
286,and croom on the mind and bates on the savage customs of polynesia   my dear  stand still   she said    neither of those could one send to the lighthouse 
287,at a certain moment  she supposed  the house would become so shabby that something must be done 
288,if they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them   that would be something 
289,crabs  she had to allow  if andrew really wished to dissect them  or if jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed  one could not prevent it  or rose own objects   shells  reeds  stones  for they were gifted  her children  but all in quite different ways 
290,and the result of it was  she sighed  taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling  as she held the stocking against james own leg  that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer 
291,the mat was fading  the wall paper was flapping 
292,you could not tell any more that those were roses on it 
293,still  if every door in a house is left perpetually open  and no lockmaker in the whole of scotland can mend a bolt  things must spoil 
294,what was the use of flinging a green cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame 
295,in two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup 
296,but it was the doors that annoyed her  every door was left open 
297,she listened 
298,the drawing room door was open  the hall door was open  it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open  and certainly the window on the landing was open  for that she had opened herself 
299,that windows should be open  and doors shut   simple as it was  could none of them remember it 
300,she would go into the maids  bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens  except for marie own  the swiss girl  who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air  but then at home  she had said   the mountains are so beautiful  
301,she had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes 
302, the mountains are so beautiful  
303,her father was dying there  mrs  ramsay knew 
304,he was leaving them fatherless 
305,scolding and demonstrating  how to make a bed  how to open a window  with hands that shut and spread like a frenchwoman own  all had folded itself quietly about her  when the girl spoke  as  after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple 
306,she had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said 
307,he had cancer of the throat 
308,at the recolection   how she had stood there  how the girl had said   at home the mountains are so beautiful   and there was no hope  no hope whatever  she had a spasm of irritation  and speaking sharply  said to james 
309, stand still  do not be tiresome   so that he knew instantly that her severity was real  and straightened his leg and she measured it 
310,the stocking was too short by half an inch at least  making allowance for the fact that sorley own little boy would be less well grown than james 
311, it is too short   she said   ever so much too short  
312,never did anybody look so sad 
313,bitter and black  half way down  in the darkness  in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths  perhaps a tear formed  a tear fell  the waters swayed this way and that  received it  and were at rest 
314,never did anybody look so sad 
315,but was it nothing but looks  people said 
316,what was there behind it   her beauty and splendour 
317,had he blown his brains out  they asked  had he died the week before they were married   some other  earlier lover  of whom rumours reached one 
318,or was there nothing 
319,nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind  and could do nothing to disturb 
320,for easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion  of love foiled  of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself  she never spoke 
321,she was silent always 
322,she knew then   she knew without having learnt 
323,her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified 
324,her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone  alight exact as a bird  gave her  naturally  this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted  eased  sustained   falsely perhaps 
325, nature has but little clay   said mr  bankes once  much moved by her voice on the telephone  though she was only telling him a fact about a train   like that of which she moulded you  
326,he saw her at the end of the line  greek  blue eyed  straight nosed 
327,how incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that 
328,the graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face 
329,yes  he would catch the   at euston 
330, but she is no more aware of her beauty than a child   said mr  bankes  replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house 
331,and he thought of mrs  ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls 
332,for always  he thought  there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face 
333,she clapped a deer stalker own hat on her head  she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief 
334,so that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of  one must remember the quivering thing  the living thing  they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them   and work it into the picture  or if one thought of her simply as a woman  one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy   she did not like admiration   or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty  and she wanted only to be like other people  insignificant 
335,he did not know 
336,he did not know 
337,he must go to his work 
338,knitting her reddish brown hairy stocking  with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame  the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame  and the authenticated masterpiece by michael angelo  mrs  ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before  raised his head  and kissed her little boy on the forehead 
339, let us find another picture to cut out   she said 
340,but what had happened 
341,some one had blundered 
342,starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time 
343, some one had blundered    fixing her short sighted eyes upon her husband  who was now bearing down upon her  she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her  the jingle mated itself in her head  that something had happened  some one had blundered 
344,but she could not for the life of her think what 
345,he shivered  he quivered 
346,all his vanity  all his satisfaction in his own splendour  riding fell as a thunderbolt  fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death  had been shattered  destroyed 
347,stormed at by shot and she will  boldly we rode and well  flashed through the valley of death  volleyed and thundered   straight into lily briscoe and william bankes 
348,he quivered  he shivered 
349,not for the world would she have spoken to him  realising  from the familiar signs  his eyes averted  and some curious gathering together of his person  as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium  that he was outraged and anguished 
350,she stroked james own head  she transferred to him what she felt for her husband  and  as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the army and navy stores catalogue  thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist  and why should he not 
351,he had a splendid forehead 
352,then  looking up  as her husband passed her once more  she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled  domesticity triumphed  custom crooned its soothing rhythm  so that when stopping deliberately  as his turn came round again  at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle james own bare calf with a sprig of something  she twitted him for having dispatched  that poor young man   charles tansley 
353,tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation  he said 
354, james will have to write his dissertation one of these days   he added ironically  flicking his sprig 
355,hating his father  james brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him  compound of severity and humour  he teased his youngest son own bare leg 
356,she was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to sorley own little boy tomorrow  said mrs  ramsay 
357,there was not the slightest possible chance that they could go to the lighthouse tomorrow  mr  ramsay snapped out irascibly 
358,how did he know 
359,she asked 
360,the wind often changed 
361,the extraordinary irrationality of her remark  the folly of women own minds enraged him 
362,he had ridden through the valley of death  been shattered and shivered  and now  she flew in the face of facts  made his children hope what was utterly out of the question  in effect  told lies 
363,he stamped his foot on the stone step 
364, damn you   he said 
365,but what had she said 
366,simply that it might be fine tomorrow 
367,so it might 
368,not with the barometer falling and the wind due west 
369,to pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people own feelings  to rendthe thin veils of civilization so wantonly  so brutally  was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that  without replying  dazed and blinded  she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail  the drench of dirty water  bespatter her unrebuked 
370,there was nothing to be said 
371,he stood by her in silence 
372,very humbly  at length  he said that he would step over and ask the coastguards if she liked 
373,there was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him 
374,she was quite ready to take his word for it  she said 
375,only then they need not cut sandwiches   that was all 
376,they came to her  naturally  since she was a woman  all day long with this and that  one wanting this  another that  the children were growing up  she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions 
377,then he said  damn you 
378,he said  it must rain 
379,he said  it will not rain  and instantly a heaven of security opened before her 
380,there was nobody she reverenced more 
381,she was not good enough to tie his shoe strings  she felt 
382,already ashamed of that petulance  of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops  mr  ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son own bare legs once more  and then  as if he had her leave for it  with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side  he dived into the evening air which  already thinner  was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but  as if in return  restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day 
383, some one had blundered   he said again  striding off  up and down the terrace 
384,but how extraordinarily his note had changed 
385,it was like the cuckoo   in june he gets out of tune   as if he were trying over  tentatively seeking  some phrase for a new mood  and having only this at hand  used it  cracked though it was 
386,but it sounded ridiculous    some one had blundered    said like that  almost as a question  without any conviction  melodiously 
387,mrs  ramsay could not help smiling  and soon  sure enough  walking up and down  he hummed it  dropped it  fell silent 
388,he was safe  he was restored to his privacy 
389,he stopped to light his pipe  looked once at his wife and son in the window  and as one raises one own eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm  a tree  a cluster of cottages as an illustration  a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns  fortified  and satisfied  so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife  the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind 
390,it was a splendid mind 
391,for if thought is like the keyboard of a piano  divided into so many notes  or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty six letters all in order  then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one  firmly and accurately  until it had reached  say  the letter q  he reached q  very few people in the whole of england ever reach q  here  stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums  he saw  but now far  far away  like children picking up shells  divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived  his wife and son  together  in the window 
392,they needed his protection  he gave it them 
393,but after q 
394,what comes next 
395,after q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes  but glimmers red in the distance 
396,z is only reached once by one man in a generation 
397,still  if he could reach r it would be something 
398,here at least was q  he dug his heels in at q  q he was sure of 
399,q he could demonstrate 
400,if q then is q   are    
401,here he knocked his pipe out  with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn  and proceeded 
402, then r    
403,he braced himself 
404,he clenched himself 
405,qualities that would have saved a ship own company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water   endurance and justice  foresight  devotion  skill  came to his help 
406,r is then   what is r 
407,a shutter  like the leathern eyelid of a lizard  flickered over the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter r  in that flash of darkness he heard people saying   he was a failure   that r was beyond him 
408,he would never reach r  on to r  once more 
409,qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes of the polar region would have made him the leader  the guide  the counsellor  whose temper  neither sanguine nor despondent  surveys with equanimity what is to be and faces it  came to his help again 
410,the lizard own eye flickered once more 
411,the veins on his forehead bulged 
412,the geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and  displayed among its leaves  he could see  without wishing it  that old  that obvious distinction between the two classes of men  on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who  plodding and persevering  repeat the whole alphabet in order  twenty six letters in all  from start to finish  on the other the gifted  the inspired who  miraculously  lump all the letters together in one flash   the way of genius 
413,he had not genius  he laid no claim to that  but he had  or might have had  the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from a to z accurately in order 
414,meanwhile  he stuck at q  on  then  on to r 
415,feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who  now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist  knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes  stole upon him  paling the colour of his eyes  giving him  even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace  the bleached look of withered old age 
416,yet he would not die lying down  he would find some crag of rock  and there  his eyes fixed on the storm  trying to the end to pierce the darkness  he would die standing 
417,he would never reach r 
418,he stood stock still  by the urn  with the geranium flowing over it 
419,how many men in a thousand million  he asked himself  reach z after all 
420,surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that  and answer  without treachery to the expedition behind him   one perhaps  
421,one in a generation 
422,is he to be blamed then if he is not that one 
423,provided he has toiled honestly  given to the best of his power  and till he has no more left to give 
424,and his fame lasts how long 
425,it is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter 
426,his fame lasts perhaps two thousand years 
427,and what are two thousand years 
428, asked mr  ramsay ironically  staring at the hedge  
429,what  indeed  if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages 
430,the very stone one kicks with one own boot will outlast shakespeare 
431,his own little light would shine  not very brightly  for a year or two  and would then be merged in some bigger light  and that in a bigger still 
432, he looked into the hedge  into the intricacy of the twigs  
433,who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars  if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow  and square his shoulders  so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post  the fine figure of a soldier 
434,mr  ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very upright by the urn 
435,who shall blame him  if  so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame  upon search parties  upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones 
436,finally  who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition  if  having adventured to the uttermost  and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not  he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives  and does not on the whole object to live  but requires sympathy  and whisky  and some one to tell the story of his suffering to at once 
437,who shall blame him 
438,who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off  and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son  who  very distant at first  gradually come closer and closer  till lips and book and head are clearly before him  though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars  and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before her   who will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world 
439,but his son hated him 
440,he hated him for coming up to them  for stopping and looking down on them  he hated him for interrupting them  he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures  for the magnificence of his head  for his exactingness and egotism  for there he stood  commanding them to attend to him  but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father own emotion which  vibrating round them  disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother 
441,by looking fixedly at the page  he hoped to make him move on  by pointing his finger at a word  he hoped to recall his mother own attention  which  he knew angrily  wavered instantly his father stopped 
442,but  no 
443,nothing would make mr  ramsay move on 
444,there he stood  demanding sympathy 
445,mrs  ramsay  who had been sitting loosely  folding her son in her arm  braced herself  and  half turning  seemed to raise herself with an effort  and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy  a column of spray  looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force  burning and illuminating  quietly though she sat  taking up her stocking again   and into this delicious fecundity  this fountain and spray of life  the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself  like a beak of brass  barren and bare 
446,he wanted sympathy 
447,he was a failure  he said 
448,mrs  ramsay flashed her needles 
449,mr  ramsay repeated  never taking his eyes from her face  that he was a failure 
450,she blew the words back at him 
451, charles tansley     she said 
452,but he must have more than that 
453,it was sympathy he wanted  to be assured of his genius  first of all  and then to be taken within the circle of life  warmed and soothed  to have his senses restored to him  his barrenness made furtile  and all the rooms of the house made full of life   the drawing room  behind the drawing room the kitchen  above the kitchen the bedrooms  and beyond them the nurseries  they must be furnished  they must be filled with life 
454,charles tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time  she said 
455,but he must have more than that 
456,he must have sympathy 
457,he must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life  was needed  not only here  but all over the world 
458,flashing her needles  confident  upright  she created drawing room and kitchen  set them all aglow  bade him take his ease there  go in and out  enjoy himself 
459,she laughed  she knitted 
460,standing between her knees  very stiff  james felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass  the arid scimitar of the male  which smote mercilessly  again and again  demanding sympathy 
461,he was a failure  he repeated 
462,well  look then  feel then 
463,flashing her needles  glancing round about her  out of the window  into the room  at james himself  she assured him  beyond a shadow of a doubt  by her laugh  her poise  her competence  as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child   that it was real  the house was full  the garden blowing 
464,if he put implicit faith in her  nothing should hurt him  however deep he buried himself or climed high  not for a second should he find himself without her 
465,so boasting of her capacity to surround and protect  there was scarcely a she will of herself left for her to know herself by  all was so lavished and spent  and james  as he stood stiff between her knees  felt her rise in a rosy flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass  the arid scimitar of his father  the egotistical man  plunged and smote  demanding sympathy 
466,filled with her words  like a child who drops off satisfied  he said  at last  looking at her with humble gratitude  restored  renewed  that he would take a turn  he would watch the children playing cricket 
467,he went 
468,immediately  mrs  ramsey seemed to fold herself together  one petal closed in another  and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself  so that she had only strength enough to move her finger  in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion  across the page of grimm own fairy story  while there throbbed through her  like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat  the rapture of successful creation 
469,every throb of this pulse seemed  as he walked away  to enclose her and her husband  and to give to each that solace which two different notes  one high  one low  struck together  seem to give each other as they combine 
470,yet as the resonance died  and she turned to the fairy tale again  mrs  ramsey felt not only exhausted in body  afterwards  not at the time  she always felt this  but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin 
471,not that  as she read aloud the story of the fisherman own wife  she knew precisely what it came from  nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized  at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully  ominously  a wave fall  how it came from this  she did not like  even for a second  to feel finer than her husband  and further  could not bear not being entirely sure  when she spoke to him  of the truth of what she said 
472,universities and people wanting him  lectures and books and their being of the highest importance   all that she did not doubt for a moment  but it was their relation  and his coming to her like that  openly  so that any one could see  that discomposed her  for then people said he depended on her  when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important  and what she gave the world  in comparison with what he gave  negligable 
473,but then again  it was the other thing too   not being able to tell him the truth  being afraid  for instance  about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be  fifty pounds perhaps to mend it  and then about his books  to be afraid that he might guess  what she a little suspected  that his last book was not quite his best book  she gathered that from william bankes   and then to hide small daily things  and the children seeing it  and the burden it laid on them   all this diminished the entire joy  the pure joy  of the two notes sounding together  and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness 
474,a shadow was on the page  she looked up 
475,it was augustus carmichael shuffling past  precisely now  at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships  that the most perfect was flawed  and could not bear the examination which  loving her husband  with her instinct for truth  she turned upon it  when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness  and impeded in her proper function by these lies  these exaggerations    it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation  that mr  carmichael shuffled past  in his yellow slippers  and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out  as he passed 
476, going indoors mr  carmichael  
477,he said nothing 
478,he took opium 
479,the children said he had stained his beard yellow with it 
480,perhaps 
481,what was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy  came to them every year as an escape  and yet every year she felt the same thing  he did not trust her 
482,she said   i am going to the town  shall i get you stamps  paper  tobacco   and she felt him wince 
483,he did not trust her 
484,it was his wife own doing 
485,she remembered that iniquity of his wife own towards him  which had made her turn to steel and adamant there  in the horrible little room in st john own wood  when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house 
486,he was unkempt  he dropped things on his coat  he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do  and she turned him out of the room 
487,she said  in her odious way   now  mrs  ramsay and i want to have a little talk together   and mrs  ramsay could see  as if before her eyes  the innumerable miseries of his life 
488,had he money enough to buy tobacco 
489,did he have to ask her for it 
490,half a crown 
491,eighteenpence 
492,oh  she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer 
493,and always now  why  she could not guess  except that it came probably from that woman somehow  he shrank from her 
494,he never told her anything 
495,but what more could she have done 
496,there was a sunny room given up to him 
497,the children were good to him 
498,never did she show a sign of not wanting him 
499,she went out of her way indeed to be friendly 
500,do you want stamps  do you want tobacco 
501,here is a book you might like and so on 
502,and after all   after all  here insensibly she drew herself together  physically  the sense of her own beauty becoming  as it did so seldom  present to her  after all  she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her  for instance  george manning  mr  wallace  famous as they were  they would come to her of an evening  quietly  and talk alone over her fire 
503,she bore about with her  she could not help knowing it  the torch of her beauty  she carried it erect into any room that she entered  and after all  veil it as she might  and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her  her beauty was apparent 
504,she had been admired 
505,she had been loved 
506,she had entered rooms where mourners sat 
507,tears had flown in her presence 
508,men  and women too  letting go to the multiplicity of things  had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity 
509,it injured her that he should shrink 
510,it hurt her 
511,and yet not cleanly  not rightly 
512,that was what she minded  coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband  the sense she had now when mr  carmichael shuffled past  just nodding to her question  with a book beneath his arm  in his yellow slippers  that she was suspected  and that all this desire of hers to give  to help  was vanity 
513,for her own self satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help  to give  that people might say of her   o mrs  ramsay  dear mrs  ramsay   mrs  ramsay  of course   and need her and send for her and admire her 
514,was it not secretly this that she wanted  and therefore when mr  carmichael shrank away from her  as he did at this moment  making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly  she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct  but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her  and of human relations  how flawed they are  how despicable  how self seeking  at their best 
515,shabby and worn out  and not presumably  her cheeks were hollow  her hair was white  any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy  she had better devote her mind to the story of the fisherman and his wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness  none of her children was as sensitive as he was   her son james 
516, the man own heart grew heavy   she read aloud   and he would not go  he said to himself   it is not right   and yet he went  and when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue  and grey and thick  and no longer so green and yellow  but it was still quiet  and he stood there and said    
517,mrs  ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop 
518,why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket 
519,but he did not speak  he looked  he nodded  he approved  he went on 
520,he slipped  seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause  signified some conclusion  seeing his wife and child  seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought  and bore  written up among their leaves  as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading   he slipped  seeing all this  smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in the times about the number of americans who visit shakespeare own house every year 
521,if shakespeare had never existed  he asked  would the world have differed much from what it is today 
522,does the progress of civilization depend upon great men 
523,is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the pharaohs 
524,is the lot of the average human being  however  he asked himself  the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization 
525,possibly not 
526,possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class 
527,the liftman in the tube is an eternal necessity 
528,the thought was distasteful to him 
529,he tossed his head 
530,to avoid it  he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts 
531,he would argue that the world exists for the average human being  that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life  they do not express it 
532,nor is shakespeare necessary to it 
533,not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift  he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge 
534,all this would have to be dished up for the young men at cardiff next month  he thought  here  on his terrace  he was merely foraging and picnicking  he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly  like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses  or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood 
535,it was all familiar  this turning  that stile  that cut across the fields 
536,hours he would spend thus  with his pipe  of an evening  thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons  which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there  the life of this statesman here  with poems and with anecdotes  with figures too  this thinker  that soldier  all very brisk and clear  but at length the lane  the field  the common  the fruitful nut tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always  tied his horse to a tree  and proceeded on foot alone 
537,he reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath 
538,it was his fate  his peculiarity  whether he wished it or not  to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away  and there to stand  like a desolate sea bird  alone 
539,it was his power  his gift  suddenly to she would all superfluities  to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer  even physically  yet lost none of his intensity of mind  and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance  how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on   that was his fate  his gift 
540,but having thrown away  when he dismounted  all gestures and fripperies  all trophies of nuts and roses  and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him  kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision  and it was in this guise that he inspired in william bankes  intermittently  and in charles tansley  obsequiously and in his wife now  when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn  profoundly  reverence  and pity  and gratitude too  as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone 
541, but the father of eight children has no choice  
542,muttering half aloud  so he broke off  turned  sighed  raised his eyes  sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy  filled his pipe 
543,he turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on  which  had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something  and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over  to deprecate it  as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes 
544,it was true  he was for the most part happy  he had his wife  he had his children  he had promised in six weeks  time to talk  some nonsense  to the young men of cardiff about locke  hume  berkeley  and the causes of the french revolution 
545,but this and his pleasure in it  his glory in the phrases he made  in the ardour of youth  in his wife own beauty  in the tributes that reached him from swansea  cardiff  exeter  southampton  kidderminster  oxford  cambridge   all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase  talking nonsense   because  in effect  he had not done the thing he might have done 
546,it was a disguise  it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings  who could not say  this is what i like   this is what i am  and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe  who wondered why such concealments should be necessary  why he needed always praise  why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life  how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time 
547,teaching and preaching is beyond human power  lily suspected 
548, she was putting away her things  
549,if you are exalted you must somehow come a cropper 
550,mrs  ramsay gave him what he asked too easily 
551,then the change must be so upsetting  lily said 
552,he comes in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking nonsense 
553,imagine what a change from the things he thinks about  she said 
554,he was bearing down upon them 
555,now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea 
556,now he had turned away again 
557,yes  mr  bankes said  watching him go 
558,it was a thousand pities 
559, lily had said something about his frightening her   he changed from one mood to another so suddenly  
560,yes  said mr  bankes  it was a thousand pities that ramsay could not behave a little more like other people 
561, for he liked lily briscoe  he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly  
562,it was for that reason  he said  that the young do not read carlyle 
563,a crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold  why should he preach to us 
564,was what mr  bankes understood that young people said nowadays 
565,it was a thousand pities if you thought  as he did  that carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind 
566,lily was ashamed to say that she had not read carlyle since she was at school 
567,but in her opinion one liked mr  ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end 
568,it was not that she minded 
569,for who could be deceived by him 
570,he asked you quite openly to flatter him  to admire him  his little dodges deceived nobody 
571,what she disliked was his narrowness  his blindness  she said  looking after him 
572, a bit of a hypocrite  
573,mr  bankes suggested  looking too at mr  ramsay own back  for was he not thinking of his friendship  and of cam refusing to give him a flower  and of all those boys and girls  and his own house  full of comfort  but  since his wife own death  quiet rather 
574,of course  he had his work   all the same  he rather wished lily to agree that ramsay was  as he said   a bit of a hypocrite  
575,lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes  looking up  looking down 
576,looking up  there he was   mr  ramsay   advancing towards them  swinging  careless  oblivious  remote 
577,a bit of a hypocrite 
578,she repeated 
579,oh  no   the most sincere of men  the truest  here he was   the best  but  looking down  she thought  he is absorbed in himself  he is tyrannical  he is unjust  and kept looking down  purposely  for only so could she keep steady  staying with the ramsays 
580,directly one looked up and saw them  what she called  being in love  flooded them 
581,they became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love 
582,the sky stuck to them  the birds sang through them 
583,and  what was even more exciting  she felt  too  as she saw mr  ramsay bearing down and retreating  and mrs  ramsay sitting with james in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending  how life  from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one  became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it  there  with a dash on the beach 
584,mr  bankes expected her to answer 
585,and she was about to say something criticizing mrs  ramsay  how she was alarming  too  in her way  high handed  or words to that effect  when mr  bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture 
586,for such it was considering his age  turned sixty  and his cleanliness and his impersonality  and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him 
587,for him to gaze as lily saw him gazing at mrs  ramsay was a rapture  equivalent  lily felt  to the loves of dozens of young men  and perhaps mrs  ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men  
588,it was love  she thought  pretending to move her canvas  distilled and filtered  love that never attempted to clutch its object  but  like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols  or poets their phrases  was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain 
589,so it was indeed 
590,the world by all means should have shared it  could mr  bankes have said why that woman pleased him so  why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem  so that he rested in contemplation of it  and felt  as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants  that barbarity was tamed  the reign of chaos subdued 
591,such a rapture   for by what other name could one call it 
592,  made lily briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say 
593,it was nothing of importance  something about mrs  ramsay 
594,it paled beside this  rapture   this silent stare  for which she felt intense gratitude  for nothing so solaced her  eased her of the perplexity of life  and miraculously raised its burdens  as this sublime power  this heavenly gift  and one would no more disturb it  while it lasted  than break up the shaft of sunlight  lying level across the floor 
595,that people should love like this  that mr  bankes should feel this for mrs  ramsey  she glanced at him musing  was helpful  was exalting 
596,she wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old rag  menially  on purpose 
597,she took shelter from the reverence which covered all women  she felt herself praised 
598,let him gaze  she would steal a look at her picture 
599,she could have wept 
600,it was bad  it was bad  it was infinitely bad 
601,she could have done it differently of course  the colour could have been thinned and faded  the shapes etherealised  that was how paunceforte would have seen it 
602,but then she did not see it like that 
603,she saw the colour burning on a framework of steel  the light of a butterfly own wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral 
604,of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained 
605,and it would never be seen  never be hung even  and there was mr  tansley whispering in her ear   women cannot paint  women cannot write    
606,she now remembered what she had been going to say about mrs  ramsay 
607,she did not know how she would have put it  but it would have been something critical 
608,she had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness 
609,looking along the level of mr  bankes own glance at her  she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped  they could only seek shelter under the shade which mr  bankes extended over them both 
610,looking along his beam she added to it her different ray  thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people  bowed over her book   the best perhaps  but also  different too from the perfect shape which one saw there 
611,but why different  and how different 
612,she asked herself  scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now  yet she vowed  she would inspire them  force them to move  flow  do her bidding tomorrow 
613,how did she differ 
614,what was the spirit in her  the essential thing  by which  had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa  you would have known it  from its twisted finger  hers indisputably 
615,she was like a bird for speed  an arrow for directness 
616,she was willful  she was commanding  of course  lily reminded herself  i am thinking of her relations with women  and i am much younger  an insignificant person  living off the brompton road  
617,she opened bedroom windows 
618,she shut doors 
619, so she tried to start the tune of mrs  ramsay in her head  
620,arriving late at night  with a light tap on one own bedroom door  wrapped in an old fur coat  for the setting of her beauty was always that   hasty  but apt   she would enact again whatever it might be   charles tansley losing his umbrella  mr  carmichael snuffling and sniffing  mr  bankes saying   the vegetable salts are lost  
621,all this she would adroitly shape  even maliciously twist  and  moving over to the window  in pretence that she must go    it was dawn  she could see the sun rising    half turn back  more intimately  but still always laughing  insist that she must  minta must  they all must marry  since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her  but mrs  ramsay cared not a fig for her painting   or triumphs won by her  probably mrs  ramsay had had her share of those   and here she saddened  darkened  and came back to her chair  there could be no disputing this  an unmarried woman  she lightly took her hand for a moment   an unmarried woman has missed the best of life 
622,the house seemed full of children sleeping and mrs  ramsay listening  shaded lights and regular breathing 
623,oh  but  lily would say  there was her father  her home  even  had she dared to say it  her painting 
624,but all this seemed so little  so virginal  against the other 
625,yet  as the night wore on  and white lights parted the curtains  and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden  gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law  plead for it  she liked to be alone  she liked to be herself  she was not made for that  and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth  and confront mrs  ramsay own simple certainty  and she was childlike now  that her dear lily  her little brisk  was a fool 
626,then  she remembered  she had laid her head on mrs  ramsay own lap and laughed and laughed and laughed  laughed almost hysterically at the thought of mrs  ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand 
627,there she sat  simple  serious 
628,she had recovered her sense of her now   this was the glove own twisted finger 
629,but into what sanctuary had one penetrated 
630,lily briscoe had looked up at last  and there was mrs  ramsay  unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter  still presiding  but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished  and in its stead  something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover   the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon 
631,was it wisdom 
632,was it knowledge 
633,was it  once more  the deceptiveness of beauty  so that all one own perceptions  half way to truth  were tangled in a golden mesh 
634,or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly lily briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all 
635,every one could not be as helter skelter  hand to mouth as she was 
636,but if they knew  could they tell one what they knew 
637,sitting on the floor with her arms round mrs  ramsay own knees  close as she could get  smiling to think that mrs  ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure  she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was  physically  touching her  were stood  like the treasures in the tombs of kings  tablets bearing sacred inscriptions  which if one could spell them out  would teach one everything  but they would never be offered openly  never made public 
638,what art was there  known to love or cunning  by which one pressed through into those secret chambers 
639,what device for becoming  like waters poured into one jar  inextricably the same  one with the object one adored 
640,could the body achieve  or the mind  subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain 
641,or the heart 
642,could loving  as people called it  make her and mrs  ramsay one 
643,for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired  not inscriptions on tablets  nothing that could be written in any language known to men  but intimacy itself  which is knowledge  she had thought  leaning her head on mrs  ramsay own knee 
644,nothing happened 
645,nothing 
646,nothing  as she leant her head against mrs  ramsay own knee 
647,and yet  she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up in mrs  ramsay own heart 
648,how  then  she had asked herself  did one know one thing or another thing about people  sealed as they were 
649,only like a bee  drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste  one haunted the dome shaped hive  ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone  and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings  the hives  which were people 
650,mrs  ramsay rose 
651,lily rose 
652,mrs  ramsay went 
653,for days there hung about her  as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of  more vividly than anything she said  the sound of murmuring and  as she sat in the wicker arm chair in the drawing room window she wore  to lily own eyes  an august shape  the shape of a dome 
654,this ray passed level with mr  bankes own ray straight to mrs  ramsay sitting reading there with james at her knee 
655,but now while she still looked  mr  bankes had done 
656,he had put on his spectacles 
657,he had stepped back 
658,he had raised his hand 
659,he had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes  when lily  rousing herself  saw what he was at  and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it 
660,she would have snatched her picture off the easel  but she said to herself  one must 
661,she braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture 
662,one must  she said  one must 
663,and if it must be seen  mr  bankes was less alarming than another 
664,but that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty three years  the deposit of each day own living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony 
665,at the same time it was immensely exciting 
666,nothing could be cooler and quieter 
667,taking out a pen knife  mr  bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle 
668,what did she wish to indicate by the triangular purple shape   just there  
669,he asked 
670,it was mrs  ramsay reading to james  she said 
671,she knew his objection   that no one could tell it for a human shape 
672,but she had made no attempt at likeness  she said 
673,for what reason had she introduced them then 
674,he asked 
675,why indeed 
676,  except that if there  in that corner  it was bright  here  in this  she felt the need of darkness 
677,simple  obvious  commonplace  as it was  mr  bankes was interested 
678,mother and child then   objects of universal veneration  and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty   might be reduced  he pondered  to a purple shadow without irreverence 
679,but the picture was not of them  she said 
680,or  not in his sense 
681,there were other senses too in which one might reverence them 
682,by a shadow here and a light there  for instance 
683,her tribute took that form if  as she vaguely supposed  a picture must be a tribute 
684,a mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence 
685,a light here required a shadow there 
686,he considered 
687,he was interested 
688,he took it scientifically in complete good faith 
689,the truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side  he explained 
690,the largest picture in his drawing room  which painters had praised  and valued at a higher price than he had given for it  was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the kennet 
691,he had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the kennet  he said 
692,lily must come and see that picture  he said 
693,but now   he turned  with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas 
694,the question being one of the relations of masses  of lights and shadows  which  to be honest  he had never considered before  he would like to have it explained   what then did she wish to make of it 
695,and he indicated the scene before them 
696,she looked 
697,she could not show him what she wished to make of it  could not see it even herself  without a brush in her hand 
698,she took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent minded manner  subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general  becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children   her picture 
699,it was a question  she remembered  how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left 
700,she might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so  or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object  james perhaps  so 
701,but the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken 
702,she stopped  she did not want to bore him  she took the canvas lightly off the easel 
703,but it had been seen  it had been taken from her 
704,this man had shared with her something profoundly intimate 
705,and  thanking mr  ramsay for it and mrs  ramsay for it and the hour and the place  crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected   that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody   the strangest feeling in the world  and the most exhilarating   she nicked the catch of her paint box to  more firmly than was necessary  and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint box  the lawn  mr  bankes  and that wild villain  cam  dashing past 
706,for cam grazed the easel by an inch  she would not stop for mr  bankes and lily briscoe  though mr  bankes  who would have liked a daughter of his own  held out his hand  she would not stop for her father  whom she grazed also by an inch  nor for her mother  who called  cam  i want you a moment   as she dashed past 
707,she was off like a bird  bullet  or arrow  impelled by what desire  shot by whom  at what directed  who could say 
708,what  what 
709,mrs  ramsay pondered  watching her 
710,it might be a vision   of a she will  of a wheelbarrow  of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge  or it might be the glory of speed  no one knew 
711,but when mrs  ramsay called  cam   a second time  the projectile dropped in mid career  and cam came lagging back  pulling a leaf by the way  to her mother 
712,what was she dreaming about  mrs  ramsay wondered  seeing her engrossed  as she stood there  with some thought of her own  so that she had to repeat the message twice   ask mildred if andrew  miss doyle  and mr  rayley have come back 
713,  the words seemed to be dropped into a well  where  if the waters were clear  they were also so extraordinarily distorting that  even as they descended  one saw them twisting about to make heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child own mind 
714,what message would cam give the cook 
715,mrs  ramsay wondered 
716,and indeed it was only by waiting patiently  and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks  drinking soup out of a basin  that mrs  ramsay at last prompted that parrot like instinct which had picked up mildred own words quite accurately and could now produce them  if one waited  in a colourless singsong 
717,shifting from foot to foot  cam repeated the words   no  they have not  and I have told ellen to clear away tea  
718,minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then 
719,that could only mean  mrs  ramsay thought  one thing 
720,she must accept him  or she must refuse him 
721,this going off after luncheon for a walk  even though andrew was with them   what could it mean 
722,except that she had decided  rightly  mrs  ramsay thought  and she was very  very fond of minta   to accept that good fellow  who might not be brilliant  but then  thought mrs  ramsay  realising that james was tugging at her  to make her go on reading aloud the fisherman and his wife  she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations  charles tansley  for instance 
723,anyhow it must have happened  one way or the other  by now 
724,but she read   next morning the wife awoke first  and it was just daybreak  and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her  her husband was still stretching himself    
725,but how could minta say now that she would not have him 
726,not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone   for andrew would be off after his crabs   but possibly nancy was with them 
727,she tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch 
728,there they stood  looking at the sky  wondering about the weather  and she had said  thinking partly to cover their shyness  partly to encourage them to be off  for her sympathies were with paul  
729, there is not a cloud anywhere within miles   at which she could feel little charles tansley  who had followed them out  snigger 
730,but she did it on purpose 
731,whether nancy was there or not  she could not be certain  looking from one to the other in her mind own eye 
732,she read on   ah  wife   said the man   why should we be king  i do not want to be king    well   said the wife   if you will not be king  i will  go to the flounder  for i will be king  
733, come in or go out  cam   she said  knowing that cam was attracted only by the word  flounder  and that in a moment she would fidget and fight with james as usual 
734,cam shot off 
735,mrs  ramsay went on reading  relieved  for she and james shared the same tastes and were comfortable together 
736, and when he came to the sea  it was quite dark grey  and the water heaved up from below  and smelt putrid 
737,then he went and stood by it and said 
738, flounder  flounder  in the sea  come  i pray thee  here to me  for my wife  good ilsabil  wills not as I would have her will 
739, well  what does she want then   said the flounder 
740,  and where were they now  mrs  ramsay wondered  reading and thinking  quite easily  both at the same time  for the story of the fisherman and his wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune  which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody  and when should she be told  if nothing happened  she would have to speak seriously to minta  for she could not go trapesing about all over the country  even if nancy were with them  she tried again  unsuccessfully  to visualize their backs going down the path  and to count them   she was responsible to minta own parents   the owl and the poker  her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read  the owl and the poker   yes  they would be annoyed if they heard   and they were certain to hear   that minta  staying with the ramsays  had been seen etcetera  etcetera  etcetera   he wore a wig in the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs   she repeated  fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which  coming back from some party  she had made to amuse her husband  dear  dear  mrs  ramsay said to herself  how did they produce this incongruous daughter  this tomboy minta  with a hole in her stocking  how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust pan the sand that the parrot had scattered  and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits   interesting perhaps  but limited after all   of that bird  naturally  one had asked her to lunch  tea  dinner  finally to stay with them up at finlay  which had resulted in some friction with the owl  her mother  and more calling  and more conversation  and more sand  and really at the end of it  she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime  so she had said to her husband that night  coming back from the party   however  minta came   yes  she came  mrs  ramsay thought  suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought  and disengaging it found it to be this  a woman had once accused her of  robbing her of her daughter own affections   something mrs  doyle had said made her remember that charge again  wishing to dominate  wishing to interfere  making people do what she wished   that was the charge against her  and she thought it most unjust  how could she help being  like that  to look at 
741,no one could accuse her of taking pains to impress 
742,she was often ashamed of her own shabbiness 
743,nor was she domineering  nor was she tyrannical 
744,it was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy 
745,about things like that she did feel passionately  and would  if she had the chance  have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see 
746,no hospital on the whole island 
747,it was a disgrace 
748,milk delivered at your door in london positively brown with dirt 
749,it should be made illegal 
750,a model dairy and a hospital up here   those two things she would have liked to do  herself 
751,but how 
752,with all these children 
753,when they were older  then perhaps she would have time  when they were all at school 
754,oh  but she never wanted james to grow a day older  or cam either 
755,these two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were  demons of wickedness  angels of delight  never to see them grow up into long legged monsters 
756,nothing made up up for the loss 
757,when she read just now to james   and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets   and his eyes darkened  she thought  why should they grow up and lose all that 
758,he was the most gifted  the most sensitive of her children 
759,but all  she thought  were full of promise 
760,prue  a perfect angel with the others  and sometimes now  at night especially  she took one own breath away with her beauty 
761,andrew   even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary 
762,and nancy and roger  they were both wild creatures now  scampering about over the country all day long 
763,as for rose  her mouth was too big  but she had a wonderful gift with her hands 
764,if they had charades  rose made the dresses  made everything  liked best arranging tables  flowers  anything 
765,she did not like it that jasper should shoot birds  but it was only a stage  they all went through stages 
766,why  she asked  pressing her chin on james own head  should they grow up so fast 
767,why should they go to school 
768,she would have liked always to have had a baby 
769,she was happiest carrying one in her arms 
770,then people might say she was tyrannical  domineering  masterful  if they chose  she did not mind 
771,and  touching his hair with her lips  she thought  he will never be so happy again  but stopped herself  remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that 
772,still  it was true 
773,they were happier now than they would ever be again 
774,a tenpenny tea set made cam happy for days 
775,she heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke 
776,they came bustling along the passage 
777,then the door sprang open and in they came  fresh as roses  staring  wide awake  as if this coming into the dining room after breakfast  which they did every day of their lives  was a positive event to them  and so on  with one thing after another  all day long  until she went up to say good night to them  and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries  still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish   something they had heard  something they had picked up in the garden 
778,they all had their little treasures   and so she went down and said to her husband  why must they grow up and lose it all 
779,never will they be so happy again 
780,and he was angry 
781,why take such a gloomy view of life 
782,he said 
783,it is not sensible 
784,for it was odd  and she believed it to be true  that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier  more hopeful on the whole  than she was 
785,less exposed to human worries   perhaps that was it 
786,he had always his work to fall back on 
787,not that she herself was  pessimistic   as he accused her of being 
788,only she thought life   and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes   her fifty years 
789,there it was before her   life 
790,life  she thought   but she did not finish her thought 
791,she took a look at life  for she had a clear sense of it there  something real  something private  which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband 
792,a sort of transaction went on between them  in which she was on one side  and life was on another  and she was always trying to get the better of it  as it was of her  and sometimes they parleyed  when she sat alone   there were  she remembered  great reconciliation scenes  but for the most part  oddly enough  she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible  hostile  and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance 
793,there were eternal problems  suffering  death  the poor 
794,there was always a woman dying of cancer even here 
795,and yet she had said to all these children  you shall go through it all 
796,to eight people she had said relentlessly that  and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds  
797,for that reason  knowing what was before them   love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places   she had often the feeling  why must they grow up and lose it all 
798,and then she said to herself  brandishing her sword at life  nonsense 
799,they will be perfectly happy 
800,and here she was  she reflected  feeling life rather sinister again  making minta marry paul rayley  because whatever she might feel about her own transaction  she had had experiences which need not happen to every one  she did not name them to herself   she was driven on  too quickly she knew  almost as if it were an escape for her too  to say that people must marry  people must have children 
801,was she wrong in this  she asked herself  reviewing her conduct for the past week or two  and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon minta  who was only twenty four  to make up her mind 
802,she was uneasy 
803,had she not laughed about it 
804,was she not forgetting again how strongly she influenced people 
805,marriage needed   oh  all sorts of qualities  the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds   one   she need not name it   that was essential  the thing she had with her husband 
806,had they that 
807, then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman   she read 
808, but outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet  houses and trees toppled over  the mountains trembled  rocks rolled into the sea  the sky was pitch black  and it thundered and lightened  and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains  and all with white foam at the top  
809,she turned the page  there were only a few lines more  so that she would finish the story  though it was past bed time 
810,it was getting late 
811,the light in the garden told her that  and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together  to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety 
812,what it was about she could not think at first 
813,then she remembered  paul and minta and andrew had not come back 
814,she summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door  standing looking up into the sky 
815,andrew had his net and basket 
816,that meant he was going to catch crabs and things 
817,that meant he would climb out on to a rock  he would be cut off 
818,or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip 
819,he would roll and then crash 
820,it was growing quite dark 
821,but she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story  and added  shutting the book  and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself  looking into james own eyes   and there they are living still at this very time  
822, and that is the end   she said  and she saw in his eyes  as the interest of the story died away in them  something else take its place  something wondering  pale  like the reflection of a light  which at once made him gaze and marvel 
823,turning  she looked across the bay  and there  sure enough  coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke  was the light of the lighthouse 
824,it had been lit 
825,in a moment he would ask her   are we going to the lighthouse  
826,and she would have to say   no  not tomorrow  your father says not  
827,happily  mildred came in to fetch them  and the bustle distracted them 
828,but he kept looking back over his shoulder as mildred carried him out  and she was certain that he was thinking  we are not going to the lighthouse tomorrow  and she thought  he will remember that all his life 
829,no  she thought  putting together some of the pictures he had cut out   a refrigerator  a mowing machine  a gentleman in evening dress   children never forget 
830,for this reason  it was so important what one said  and what one did  and it was a relief when they went to bed 
831,for now she need not think about anybody 
832,she could be herself  by herself 
833,and that was what now she often felt the need of   to think  well  not even to think 
834,to be silent  to be alone 
835,all the being and the doing  expansive  glittering  vocal  evaporated  and one shrunk  with a sense of solemnity  to being oneself  a wedge shaped core of darkness  something invisible to others 
836,although she continued to knit  and sat upright  it was thus that she felt herself  and this self having she would its attachments was free for the strangest adventures 
837,when life sank down for a moment  the range of experience seemed limitless 
838,and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources  she supposed  one after another  she  lily  augustus carmichael  must feel  our apparitions  the things you know us by  are simply childish 
839,beneath it is all dark  it is all spreading  it is unfathomably deep  but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by 
840,her horizon seemed to her limitless 
841,there were all the places she had not seen  the indian plains  she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in rome 
842,this core of darkness could go anywhere  for no one saw it 
843,they could not stop it  she thought  exulting 
844,there was freedom  there was peace  there was  most welcome of all  a summoning together  a resting on a platform of stability 
845,not as oneself did one find rest ever  in her experience  she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles  but as a wedge of darkness 
846,losing personality  one lost the fret  the hurry  the stir  and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace  this rest  this eternity  and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the lighthouse  the long steady stroke  the last of the three  which was her stroke  for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw  and this thing  the long steady stroke  was her stroke 
847,often she found herself sitting and looking  sitting and looking  with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at   that light  for example 
848,and it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that    children do not forget  children do not forget    which she would repeat and begin adding to it  it will end  it will end  she said 
849,it will come  it will come  when suddenly she added  we are in the hands of the lord 
850,but instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that 
851,who had said it 
852,not she  she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean 
853,she looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes  searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart  purifying out of existence that lie  any lie 
854,she praised herself in praising the light  without vanity  for she was stern  she was searching  she was beautiful like that light 
855,it was odd  she thought  how if one was alone  one leant to inanimate things  trees  streams  flowers  felt they expressed one  felt they became one  felt they knew one  in a sense were one  felt an irrational tenderness thus  she looked at that long steady light  as for oneself 
856,there rose  and she looked and looked with her needles suspended  there curled up off the floor of the mind  rose from the lake of one own being  a mist  a bride to meet her lover 
857,what brought her to say that   we are in the hands of the lord   she wondered 
858,the insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her  annoyed her 
859,she returned to her knitting again 
860,how could any lord have made this world 
861,she asked 
862,with her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason  order  justice  but suffering  death  the poor 
863,there was no treachery too base for the world to commit  she knew that 
864,no happiness lasted  she knew that 
865,she knitted with firm composure  slightly pursing her lips and  without being aware of it  so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed  though he was chuckling at the thought that hume  the philosopher  grown enormously fat  had stuck in a bog  he could not help noting  as he passed  the sternness at the heart of her beauty 
866,it saddened him  and her remoteness pained him  and he felt  as he passed  that he could not protect her  and  when he reached the hedge  he was sad 
867,he could do nothing to help her 
868,he must stand by and watch her 
869,indeed  the infernal truth was  he made things worse for her 
870,he was irritable   he was touchy 
871,he had lost his temper over the lighthouse 
872,he looked into the hedge  into its intricacy  its darkness 
873,always  mrs  ramsay felt  one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end  some sound  some sight 
874,she listened  but it was all very still  cricket was over  the children were in their baths  there was only the sound of the sea 
875,she stopped knitting  she held the long reddish brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment 
876,she saw the light again 
877,with some irony in her interrogation  for when one woke at all  one own relations changed  she looked at the steady light  the pitiless  the remorseless  which was so much her  yet so little her  which had her at its beck and call  she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed  stroking the floor   but for all that she thought  watching it with fascination  hypnotised  as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight  she had known happiness  exquisite happiness  intense happiness  and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly  as daylight faded  and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt  it is enough 
878,it is enough 
879,he turned and saw her 
880,she was lovely  lovelier now than ever he thought 
881,but he could not speak to her 
882,he could not interrupt her 
883,he wanted urgently to speak to her now that james was gone and she was alone at last 
884,but he resolved  no  he would not interrupt her 
885,she was aloof from him now in her beauty  in her sadness 
886,he would let her be  and he passed her without a word  though it hurt him that she should look so distant  and he could not reach her  he could do nothing to help her 
887,and again he would have passed her without a word had she not  at that very moment  given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask  and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame  and gone to him 
888,for he wished  she knew  to protect her 
889,she folded the green shawl about her shoulders 
890,she took his arm 
891,his beauty was so great  she said  beginning to speak of kennedy the gardener  at once he was so awfully handsome  that she could not dismiss him 
892,there was a ladder against the greenhouse  and little lumps of putty stuck about  for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse 
893,yes  but as she strolled along with her husband  she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed 
894,she had it on the tip of her tongue to say  as they strolled   it will cost fifty pounds   but instead  for her heart failed her about money  she talked about jasper shooting birds  and he said  at once  soothing her instantly  that it was natural in a boy  and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long 
895,her husband was so sensible  so just 
896,and so she said   yes  all children go through stages   and began considering the dahlias in the big bed  and wondering what about next year own flowers  and had he heard the children own nickname for charles tansley  she asked 
897,the atheist  they called him  the little atheist 
898, he is not a polished specimen   said mr  ramsay 
899, far from it   said mrs  ramsay 
900,she supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices  mrs  ramsay said  wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs  did they plant them 
901, oh  he has his dissertation to write   said mr  ramsay 
902,she knew all about that  said mrs  ramsay 
903,he talked of nothing else 
904,it was about the influence of somebody upon something 
905, well  it is all he has to count on   said mr  ramsay 
906, pray heaven he will not fall in love with prue   said mrs  ramsay 
907,he would disinherit her if she married him  said mr  ramsay 
908,he did not look at the flowers  which his wife was considering  but at a spot about a foot or so above them 
909,there was no harm in him  he added  and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in england who admired his   when he choked it back 
910,he would not bother her again about his books 
911,these flowers seemed creditable  mr  ramsay said  lowering his gaze and noticing something red  something brown 
912,yes  but then these she had put in with her own hands  said mrs  ramsay 
913,the question was  what happened if she sent bulbs down  did kennedy plant them 
914,it was his incurable laziness  she added  moving on 
915,if she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand  he did sometimes do a stroke of work 
916,so they strolled along  towards the red hot pokers 
917, you are teaching your daughters to exaggerate   said mr  ramsay  reproving her 
918,her aunt camilla was far worse than she was  mrs  ramsay remarked 
919, nobody ever held up your aunt camilla as a model of virtue that I am aware of   said mr  ramsay 
920, she was the most beautiful woman i ever saw   said mrs  ramsay 
921, somebody else was that   said mr  ramsay 
922,prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was  said mrs  ramsay 
923,he saw no trace of it  said mr  ramsay 
924, well  then  look tonight   said mrs  ramsay 
925,they paused 
926,he wished andrew could be induced to work harder 
927,he would lose every chance of a scholarship if he did not 
928, oh  scholarships   she said 
929,mr  ramsay thought her foolish for saying that  about a serious thing  like a scholarship 
930,he should be very proud of andrew if he got a scholarship  he said 
931,she would be just as proud of him if he did not  she answered 
932,they disagreed always about this  but it did not matter 
933,she liked him to believe in scholarships  and he liked her to be proud of andrew whatever he did 
934,suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs 
935,was not it late 
936,she asked 
937,they had not come home yet 
938,he flicked his watch carelessly open 
939,but it was only just past seven 
940,he held his watch open for a moment  deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace 
941,to begin with  it was not reasonable to be so nervous 
942,andrew could look after himself 
943,then  he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now   here he became uncomfortable  as if he were breaking into that solitude  that aloofness  that remoteness of hers 
944,but she pressed him 
945,what had he wanted to tell her  she asked  thinking it was about going to the lighthouse  that he was sorry he had said  damn you  
946,but no 
947,he did not like to see her look so sad  he said 
948,only wool gathering  she protested  flushing a little 
949,they both felt uncomfortable  as if they did not know whether to go on or go back 
950,she had been reading fairy tales to james  she said 
951,no  they could not share that  they could not say that 
952,they had reached the gap between the two clumps of red hot pokers  and there was the lighthouse again  but she would not let herself look at it 
953,had she known that he was looking at her  she thought  she would not have let herself sit there  thinking 
954,she disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking 
955,so she looked over her shoulder  at the town 
956,the lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind 
957,and all the poverty  all the suffering had turned to that  mrs  ramsay thought 
958,the lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk 
959,well  if he could not share her thoughts  mr  ramsay said to himself  he would be off  then  on his own 
960,he wanted to go on thinking  telling himself the story how hume was stuck in a bog  he wanted to laugh 
961,but first it was nonsense to be anxious about andrew 
962,when he was andrew own age he used to walk about the country all day long  with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him  or thought that he had fallen over a cliff 
963,he said aloud he thought he would be off for a day own walk if the weather held 
964,he had had about enough of bankes and of carmichael 
965,he would like a little solitude 
966,yes  she said 
967,it annoyed him that she did not protest 
968,she knew that he would never do it 
969,he was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket 
970,she worried about the boys  but not about him 
971,years ago  before he had married  he thought  looking across the bay  as they stood between the clumps of red hot pokers  he had walked all day 
972,he had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house 
973,he had worked ten hours at a stretch  an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire 
974,that was the country he liked best  over there  those sandhills dwindling away into darkness 
975,one could walk all day without meeting a soul 
976,there was not a house scarcely  not a single village for miles on end 
977,one could worry things out alone 
978,there were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time 
979,the seals sat up and looked at you 
980,it sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there  alone   he broke off  sighing 
981,he had no right 
982,the father of eight children   he reminded himself 
983,and he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered 
984,andrew would be a better man than he had been 
985,prue would be a beauty  her mother said 
986,they would stem the flood a bit 
987,that was a good bit of work on the whole   his eight children 
988,they showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely  for on an evening like this  he thought  looking at the land dwindling away  the little island seemed pathetically small  half swallowed up in the sea 
989, poor little place   he murmured with a sigh 
990,she heard him 
991,he said the most melancholy things  but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual 
992,all this phrase making was a game  she thought  for if she had said half what he said  she would have blown her brains out by now 
993,it annoyed her  this phrase making  and she said to him  in a matter  of fact way  that it was a perfectly lovely evening 
994,and what was he groaning about  she asked  half laughing  half complaining  for she guessed what he was thinking   he would have written better books if he had not married 
995,he was not complaining  he said 
996,she knew that he did not complain 
997,she knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of 
998,and he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes  and quickly he dropped it 
999,they turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver green spear like plants grew  arm in arm 
1000,his arm was almost like a young man own arm  mrs  ramsay thought  thin and hard  and she thought with delight how strong he still was  though he was over sixty  and how untamed and optimistic  and how strange it was that being convinced  as he was  of all sorts of horrors  seemed not to depress him  but to cheer him 
1001,was it not odd  she reflected 
1002,indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people  born blind  deaf  and dumb  to the ordinary things  but to the extraordinary things  with an eye like an eagle own 
1003,his understanding often astonished her 
1004,but did he notice the flowers 
1005,did he notice the view 
1006,did he even notice his own daughter own beauty  or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef 
1007,he would sit at table with them like a person in a dream 
1008,and his habit of talking aloud  or saying poetry aloud  was growing on him  she was afraid  for sometimes it was awkward  
1009,best and brightest come away 
1010,poor miss giddings  when he shouted that at her  almost jumped out of her skin 
1011,but then  mrs  ramsay  though instantly taking his side against all the silly giddingses in the world  then  she thought  intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her  and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank  then  she thought  stooping down to look  a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours 
1012,all the great men she had ever known  she thought  deciding that a rabbit must have got in  were like that  and it was good for young men  though the atmosphere of lecture rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost  simply to hear him  simply to look at him 
1013,but without shooting rabbits  how was one to keep them down 
1014,she wondered 
1015,it might be a rabbit  it might be a mole 
1016,some creature anyhow was ruining her evening primroses 
1017,and looking up  she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full throbbing star  and wanted to make her husband look at it  for the sight gave her such keen pleasure 
1018,but she stopped herself 
1019,he never looked at things 
1020,if he did  all he would say would be  poor little world  with one of his sighs 
1021,at that moment  he said   very fine   to please her  and pretended to admire the flowers 
1022,but she knew quite well that he did not admire them  or even realise that they were there 
1023,it was only to please her 
1024,ah  but was that not lily briscoe strolling along with william bankes 
1025,she focussed her short sighted eyes upon the backs of a retreating couple 
1026,yes  indeed it was 
1027,did that not mean that they would marry 
1028,yes  it must 
1029,what an admirable idea 
1030,they must marry 
1031,he had been to amsterdam  mr  bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with lily briscoe 
1032,he had seen the rembrandts 
1033,he had been to madrid 
1034,unfortunately  it was good friday and the prado was shut 
1035,he had been to rome 
1036,had miss briscoe never been to rome 
1037,oh  she should   it would be a wonderful experience for her   the sistine chapel  michael angelo  and padua  with its giottos 
1038,his wife had been in bad health for many years  so that their sight seeing had been on a modest scale 
1039,she had been to brussels  she had been to paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill 
1040,she had been to dresden  there were masses of pictures she had not seen  however  lily briscoe reflected  perhaps it was better not to see pictures  they only made one hopelessly discontented with one own own work 
1041,mr  bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far 
1042,we cannot all be titians and we cannot all be darwins  he said  at the same time he doubted whether you could have your darwin and your titian if it were not for humble people like ourselves 
1043,lily would have liked to pay him a compliment  you are not humble  mr  bankes  she would have liked to have said 
1044,but he did not want compliments  most men do  she thought   and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures 
1045,anyhow  said lily  tossing off her little insincerity  she would always go on painting  because it interested her 
1046,yes  said mr  bankes  he was sure she would  and  as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw the ramsays 
1047,so that is marriage  lily thought  a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball 
1048,that is what mrs  ramsay tried to tell me the other night  she thought 
1049,for she was wearing a green shawl  and they were standing close together watching prue and jasper throwing catches 
1050,and suddenly the meaning which  for no reason at all  as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell  descends on people  making them symbolical  making them representative  came upon them  and made them in the dusk standing  looking  the symbols of marriage  husband and wife 
1051,then  after an instant  the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again  and they became  as they met them  mr  and mrs  ramsay watching the children throwing catches 
1052,but still for a moment  though mrs  ramsay greeted them with her usual smile  oh  she is thinking we are going to get married  lily thought  and said   i have triumphed tonight   meaning that for once mr  bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly  still  for one moment  there was a sense of things having been blown apart  of space  of irresponsibility as the ball soared high  and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches 
1053,in the failing light they all looked sharp edged and ethereal and divided by great distances 
1054,then  darting backwards over the vast space  for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether   prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand  and her mother said   have not they come back yet   whereupon the spell was broken 
1055,mr  ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the lord own prayer  and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study 
1056,mrs  ramsay  bringing prue back into throwing catches again  from which she had escaped  asked 
1057, did nancy go with them  
1058,certainly  nancy had gone with them  since minta doyle had asked it with her dumb look  holding out her hand  as nancy made off  after lunch  to her attic  to escape the horror of family life 
1059,she supposed she must go then 
1060,she did not want to go 
1061,she did not want to be drawn into it all 
1062,for as they walked along the road to the cliff minta kept on taking her hand 
1063,then she would let it go 
1064,then she would take it again 
1065,what was it she wanted 
1066,nancy asked herself 
1067,there was something  of course  that people wanted  for when minta took her hand and held it  nancy  reluctantly  saw the whole world spread out beneath her  as if it were constantinople seen through a mist  and then  however heavy eyed one might be  one must needs ask   is that santa sofia    is that the golden horn  
1068,so nancy asked  when minta took her hand 
1069, what is it that she wants  is it that  
1070,and what was that 
1071,here and there emerged from the mist  as nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her  a pinnacle  a dome  prominent things  without names 
1072,but when minta dropped her hand  as she did when they ran down the hillside  all that  the dome  the pinnacle  whatever it was that had protruded through the mist  sank down into it and disappeared 
1073,minta  andrew observed  was rather a good walker 
1074,she wore more sensible clothes that most women 
1075,she wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers 
1076,she would jump straight into a stream and flounder across 
1077,he liked her rashness  but he saw that it would not do   she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days 
1078,she seemed to be afraid of nothing   except bulls 
1079,at the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming  which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course 
1080,but she did not mind owning up to it in the least  one must admit that 
1081,she knew she was an awful coward about bulls  she said 
1082,she thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby 
1083,she did not seem to mind what she said or did 
1084,suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about
1085,damn your eyes  damn your eyes 
1086,they all had to join in and sing the chorus  and shout out together 
1087,damn your eyes  damn your eyes 
1088,but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting grounds before they got on to the beach 
1089, fatal   paul agreed  springing up  and as they went slithering down  he kept quoting the guide book about  these islands being justly celebrated for their park like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities  
1090,but it would not do altogether  this shouting and damning your eyes  andrew felt  picking his way down the cliff  this clapping him on the back  and calling him  old fellow  and all that  it would not altogether do 
1091,it was the worst of taking women on walks 
1092,once on the beach they separated  he going out on to the pope own nose  taking his shoes off  and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves  nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves 
1093,she crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber like sea anemones  who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock 
1094,brooding  she changed the pool into the sea  and made the minnows into sharks and whales  and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun  and so brought darkness and desolation  like god himself  to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures  and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down 
1095,out on the pale criss crossed sand  high stepping  fringed  gauntleted  stalked some fantastic leviathan  she was still enlarging the pool   and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side 
1096,and then  letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky  on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon  she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing  hypnotised  and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess  the pool had diminished again  flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body  her own life  and the lives of all the people in the world  for ever  to nothingness 
1097,so listening to the waves  crouching over the pool  she brooded 
1098,and andrew shouted that the sea was coming in  so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there   oh  heavens  in each other own arms  were paul and minta kissing probably 
1099,she was outraged  indignant 
1100,she and andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it 
1101,indeed they were rather sharp with each other 
1102,she might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was  andrew grumbled 
1103,however  they both felt  it is not our fault 
1104,they had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen 
1105,all the same it irritated andrew that nancy should be a woman  and nancy that andrew should be a man  and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight 
1106,it was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother own brooch   her grandmother own brooch  the sole ornament she possessed   a weeping willow  it was  they must remember it  set in pearls 
1107,they must have seen it  she said  with the tears running down her cheeks  the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life 
1108,now she had lost it 
1109,she would rather have lost anything than that 
1110,she would go back and look for it 
1111,they all went back 
1112,they poked and peered and looked 
1113,they kept their heads very low  and said things shortly and gruffly 
1114,paul rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting 
1115,all this pother about a brooch really did not do at all  andrew thought  as paul told him to make a  thorough search between this point and that  
1116,the tide was coming in fast 
1117,the sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute 
1118,there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now 
1119, we shall be cut off  
1120,minta shrieked  suddenly terrified 
1121,as if there were any danger of that 
1122,it was the same as the bulls all over again   she had no control over her emotions  andrew thought 
1123,women had not 
1124,the wretched paul had to pacify her 
1125,the men  andrew and paul at once became manly  and different from usual  took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant rayley own stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again 
1126,there was nothing more that could be done now 
1127,if the brooch was there  it would still be there in the morning  they assured her  but minta still sobbed  all the way up to the top of the cliff 
1128,it was her grandmother own brooch  she would rather have lost anything but that  and yet nancy felt  it might be true that she minded losing her brooch  but she was not crying only for that 
1129,she was crying for something else 
1130,we might all sit down and cry  she felt 
1131,but she did not know what for 
1132,they drew ahead together  paul and minta  and he comforted her  and said how famous he was for finding things 
1133,once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch 
1134,he would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it 
1135,it seemed to him that it would be almost dark  and he would be alone on the beach  and somehow it would be rather dangerous 
1136,he began telling her  however  that he would certainly find it  and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn  it was lost  she knew that  she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon 
1137,and secretly he resolved that he would not tell her  but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to edinburgh and buy her another  just like it but more beautiful 
1138,he would prove what he could do 
1139,and as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them  the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him   his marriage  his children  his house  and again he thought  as they came out on to the high road  which was shaded with high bushes  how they would retreat into solitude together  and walk on and on  he always leading her  and she pressing close to his side  as she did now  
1140,as they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through  and he must tell some one   mrs  ramsay of course  for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done 
1141,it had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him 
1142,he would go straight to mrs  ramsay  because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it 
1143,she had made him think he could do anything 
1144,nobody else took him seriously 
1145,but she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted 
1146,he had felt her eyes on him all day today  following him about  though she never said a word  as if she were saying   yes  you can do it  i believe in you  i expect it of you  
1147,she had made him feel all that  and directly they got back  he looked for the lights of the house above the bay  he would go to her and say   I have done it  mrs  ramsay  thanks to you  
1148,and so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows 
1149,they must be awfully late then 
1150,people were getting ready for dinner 
1151,the house was all lit up  and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full  and he said to himself  childishly  as he walked up the drive  lights  lights  lights  and repeated in a dazed way  lights  lights  lights  as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff 
1152,but  good heavens  he said to himself  putting his hand to his tie  i must not make a fool of myself 
1153, yes   said prue  in her considering way  answering her mother own question   i think nancy did go with them  
1154,well then  nancy had gone with them  mrs  ramsay supposed  wondering  as she put down a brush  took up a comb  and said  come in  to a tap at the door  jasper and rose came in   whether the fact that nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen  it made it less likely  somehow  mrs  ramsay felt  very irrationally  except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable 
1155,they could not all be drowned 
1156,and again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist  life 
1157,jasper and rose said that mildred wanted to know whether she should wait dinner 
1158, not for the queen of england   said mrs  ramsay emphatically 
1159, not for the empress of mexico   she added  laughing at jasper  for he shared his mother own vice  he  too  exaggerated 
1160,and if rose liked  she said  while jasper took the message  she might choose which jewels she was to wear 
1161,when there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner  one cannot keep things waiting for ever 
1162,she was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late  it was inconsiderate of them  and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them  that they should choose this very night to be out late  when  in fact  she wished the dinner to be particularly nice  since william bankes had at last consented to dine with them  and they were having mildred own masterpiece   boeuf en daube 
1163,everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready 
1164,the beef  the bayleaf  and the wine   all must be done to a turn 
1165,to keep it waiting was out of the question 
1166,yet of course tonight  of all nights  out they went  and they came in late  and things had to be sent out  things had to be kept hot  the boeuf en daube would be entirely spoilt 
1167,jasper offered her an opal necklace  rose a gold necklace 
1168,which looked best against her black dress 
1169,which did indeed  said mrs  ramsay absent mindedly  looking at her neck and shoulders  but avoiding her face  in the glass 
1170,and then  while the children rummaged among her things  she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused her   the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on 
1171,every time  they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again  because  she thought  the old rook  the father rook  old joseph was her name for him  was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition 
1172,he was a disreputable old bird  with half his wing feathers missing 
1173,he was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house 
1174, look   she said  laughing 
1175,they were actually fighting 
1176,joseph and mary were fighting 
1177,anyhow they all went up again  and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes 
1178,the movements of the wings beating out  out  out   she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself   was one of the loveliest of all to her 
1179,look at that  she said to rose  hoping that rose would see it more clearly than she could 
1180,for one own children so often gave one own own perceptions a little thrust forwards 
1181,but which was it to be 
1182,they had all the trays of her jewel case open 
1183,the gold necklace  which was italian  or the opal necklace  which uncle james had brought her from india  or should she wear her amethysts 
1184, choose  dearests  choose   she said  hoping that they would make haste 
1185,but she let them take their time to choose  she let rose  particularly  take up this and then that  and hold her jewels against the black dress  for this little ceremony of choosing jewels  which was gone through every night  was what rose liked best  she knew 
1186,she had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear 
1187,what was the reason  mrs  ramsay wondered  standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen  divining  through her own past  some deep  some buried  some quite speechless feeling that one had for one own mother at rose own age 
1188,like all feelings felt for oneself  mrs  ramsay thought  it made one sad 
1189,it was so inadequate  what one could give in return  and what rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was 
1190,and rose would grow up  and rose would suffer  she supposed  with these deep feelings  and she said she was ready now  and they would go down  and jasper  because he was the gentleman  should give her his arm  and rose  as she was the lady  should carry her handkerchief  she gave her the handkerchief   and what else 
1191,oh  yes  it might be cold  a shawl 
1192,choose me a shawl  she said  for that would please rose  who was bound to suffer so 
1193, there   she said  stopping by the window on the landing   there they are again  
1194,joseph had settled on another tree  top 
1195, do not you think they mind   she said to jasper   having their wings broken  
1196,why did he want to shoot poor old joseph and mary 
1197,he shuffled a little on the stairs  and felt rebuked  but not seriously  for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds  and they did not feel  and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world  but he rather liked her stories about mary and joseph 
1198,she made him laugh 
1199,but how did she know that those were mary and joseph 
1200,did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night 
1201,he asked 
1202,but here  suddenly  like all grown up people  she ceased to pay him the least attention 
1203,she was listening to a clatter in the hall 
1204, they have come back   she exclaimed  and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved 
1205,then she wondered  had it happened 
1206,she would go down and they would tell her   but no 
1207,they could not tell her anything  with all these people about 
1208,so she must go down and begin dinner and wait 
1209,and  like some queen who  finding her people gathered in the hall  looks down upon them  and descends among them  and acknowledges their tributes silently  and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her  paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed  she went down  and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly  as if she accepted what they could not say  their tribute to her beauty 
1210,but she stopped 
1211,there was a smell of burning 
1212,could they have let the boeuf en daube overboil 
1213,she wondered  pray heaven not  when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly  authoritatively  that all those scattered about  in attics  in bedrooms  on little perches of their own  reading  writing  putting the last smooth to their hair  or fastening dresses  must leave all that  and the little odds and ends on their washing tables and dressing tables  and the novels on the bed  tables  and the diaries which were so private  and assemble in the dining room for dinner 
1214,but what have i done with my life 
1215,thought mrs  ramsay  taking her place at the head of the table  and looking at all the plates making white circles on it 
1216, william  sit by me   she said 
1217, lily   she said  wearily   over there  
1218,they had that   paul rayley and minta doyle   she  only this   an infinitely long table and plates and knives 
1219,at the far end was her husband  sitting down  all in a heap  frowning 
1220,what at 
1221,she did not know 
1222,she did not mind 
1223,she could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him 
1224,she had a sense of being past everything  through everything  out of everything  as she helped the soup  as if there was an eddy   there   and one could be in it  or one could be out of it  and she was out of it 
1225,it is all come to an end  she thought  while they came in one after another  charles tansley    sit there  please   she said   augustus carmichael   and sat down 
1226,and meanwhile she waited  passively  for some one to answer her  for something to happen 
1227,but this is not a thing  she thought  ladling out soup  that one says 
1228,raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy   that was what she was thinking  this was what she was doing   ladling out soup   she felt  more and more strongly  outside that eddy  or as if a shade had fallen  and  robbed of colour  she saw things truly 
1229,the room  she looked round it  was very shabby 
1230,there was no beauty anywhere 
1231,she forebore to look at mr  tansley 
1232,nothing seemed to have merged 
1233,they all sat separate 
1234,and the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her 
1235,again she felt  as a fact without hostility  the sterility of men  for if she did not do it nobody would do it  and so  giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped  the old familiar pulse began beating  as the watch begins ticking   one  two  three  one  two  three 
1236,and so on and so on  she repeated  listening to it  sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news paper 
1237,and so then  she concluded  addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to william bankes   poor man  who had no wife  and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight  and in pity for him  life being now strong enough to bear her on again  she began all this business  as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how  had the ship sunk  he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea 
1238, did you find your letters  i told them to put them in the hall for you   she said to william bankes 
1239,lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no man own land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon 
1240,how old she looks  how worn she looks  lily thought  and how remote 
1241,then when she turned to william bankes  smiling  it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again  and lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved  why does she pity him 
1242,for that was the impression she gave  when she told him that his letters were in the hall 
1243,poor william bankes  she seemed to be saying  as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people  and the life in her  her resolve to live again  had been stirred by pity 
1244,and it was not true  lily thought  it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people own 
1245,he is not in the least pitiable 
1246,he has his work  lily said to herself 
1247,she remembered  all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure  that she had her work 
1248,in a flash she saw her picture  and thought  yes  i shall put the tree further in the middle  then i shall avoid that awkward space 
1249,that is what i shall do 
1250,that is what has been puzzling me 
1251,she took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table cloth  so as to remind herself to move the tree 
1252, it is odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post  yet one always wants one own letters   said mr  bankes 
1253,what damned rot they talk  thought charles tansley  laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate  which he had swept clean  as if  lily thought  he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view   he were determined to make sure of his meals 
1254,everything about him had that meagre fixity  that bare unloveliness 
1255,but nevertheless  the fact remained  it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them 
1256,she liked his eyes  they were blue  deep set  frightening 
1257, do you write many letters  mr  tansley   asked mrs  ramsay  pitying him too  lily supposed  for that was true of mrs  ramsay   she pitied men always as if they lacked something   women never  as if they had something 
1258,he wrote to his mother  otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month  said mr  tansley  shortly 
1259,for he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women 
1260,he had been reading in his room  and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly  superficial  flimsy 
1261,why did they dress 
1262,he had come down in his ordinary clothes 
1263,he had not got any dress clothes 
1264, one never gets anything worth having by post    that was the sort of thing they were always saying 
1265,they made men say that sort of thing 
1266,yes  it was pretty well true  he thought 
1267,they never got anything worth having from one year own end to another 
1268,they did nothing but talk  talk  talk  eat  eat  eat 
1269,it was the women own fault 
1270,women made civilisation impossible with all their  charm   all their silliness 
1271, no going to the lighthouse tomorrow  mrs  ramsay   he said  asserting himself 
1272,he liked her  he admired her  he still thought of the man in the drain pipe looking up at her  but he felt it necessary to assert himself 
1273,he was really  lily briscoe thought  in spite of his eyes  but then look at his nose  look at his hands  the most uncharming human being she had ever met 
1274,then why did she mind what he said 
1275,women cannot write  women cannot paint   what did that matter coming from him  since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him  and that was why he said it 
1276,why did her whole being bow  like corn under a wind  and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort 
1277,she must make it once more 
1278,there is the sprig on the table cloth  there is my painting  i must move the tree to the middle  that matters   nothing else 
1279,could she not hold fast to that  she asked herself  and not lose her temper  and not argue  and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him 
1280, oh  mr  tansley   she said   do take me to the lighthouse with you  i should so love it  
1281,she was telling lies he could see 
1282,she was saying what she did not mean to annoy him  for some reason 
1283,she was laughing at him 
1284,he was in his old flannel trousers 
1285,he had no others 
1286,he felt very rough and isolated and lonely 
1287,he knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason  she did not want to go to the lighthouse with him  she despised him  so did prue ramsay  so did they all 
1288,but he was not going to be made a fool of by women  so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said  all in a jerk  very rudely  it would be too rough for her tomorrow 
1289,she would be sick 
1290,it annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that  with mrs  ramsay listening 
1291,if only he could be alone in his room working  he thought  among his books 
1292,that was where he felt at his ease 
1293,and he had never run a penny into debt  he had never cost his father a penny since he was fifteen  he had helped them at home out of his savings  he was educating his sister 
1294,still  he wished he had known how to answer miss briscoe properly  he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like that 
1295, you would be sick  
1296,he wished he could think of something to say to mrs  ramsay  something which would show her that he was not just a dry prig 
1297,that was what they all thought him 
1298,he turned to her 
1299,but mrs  ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william bankes 
1300, yes  take it away   she said briefly  interrupting what she was saying to william bankes to speak to the maid 
1301, it must have been fifteen   no  twenty years ago   that i last saw her   she was saying  turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk  for she was absorbed by what they were saying 
1302,so he had actually heard from her this evening 
1303,and was carrie still living at marlow  and was everything still the same 
1304,oh  she could remember it as if it were yesterday   on the river  feeling it as if it were yesterday   going on the river  feeling very cold 
1305,but if the mannings made a plan they stuck to it 
1306,never should she forget herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank 
1307,and it was still going on  mrs  ramsay mused  gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing room on the banks of the thames where she had been so very  very cold twenty years ago  but now she went among them like a ghost  and it fascinated her  as if  while she had changed  that particular day  now become very still and beautiful  had remained there  all these years 
1308,had carrie written to him herself 
1309,she asked 
1310, yes  she says they are building a new billiard room   he said 
1311,that was out of the question 
1312,building a new billiard room 
1313,it seemed to her impossible 
1314,mr  bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it 
1315,they were very well off now 
1316,should he give her love to carrie 
1317, oh   said mrs  ramsay with a little start   no   she added  reflecting that she did not know this carrie who built a new billiard room 
1318,but how strange  she repeated  to mr  bankes own amusement  that they should be going on there still 
1319,for it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time 
1320,how eventful her own life had been  during those same years 
1321,yet perhaps carrie manning had not thought about her  either 
1322,the thought was strange and distasteful 
1323, people soon drift apart   said mr  bankes  feeling  however  some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings and the ramsays 
1324,he had not drifted apart he thought  laying down his spoon and wiping his clean shaven lips punctiliously 
1325,but perhaps he was rather unusual  he thought  in this  he never let himself get into a groove 
1326,he had friends in all circles   mrs 
1327,ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot 
1328,that was why he preferred dining alone 
1329,all those interruptions annoyed him 
1330,well  thought william bankes  preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure  such are the sacrifices one own friends ask of one 
1331,it would have hurt her if he had refused to come 
1332,but it was not worth it for him 
1333,looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now  he would have been free to work 
1334,yes  he thought  it is a terrible waste of time 
1335,the children were dropping in still 
1336, i wish one of you would run up to roger own room   mrs  ramsay was saying 
1337,how trifling it all is  how boring it all is  he thought  compared with the other thing   work 
1338,here he sat drumming his fingers on the table cloth when he might have been   he took a flashing bird own eye view of his work 
1339,what a waste of time it all was to be sure 
1340,yet  he thought  she is one of my oldest friends 
1341,i am by way of being devoted to her 
1342,yet now  at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him  her beauty meant nothing to him  her sitting with her little boy at the window   nothing  nothing 
1343,he wished only to be alone and to take up that book 
1344,he felt uncomfortable  he felt treacherous  that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her 
1345,the truth was that he did not enjoy family life 
1346,it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself  what does one live for 
1347,why  one asked oneself  does one take all these pains for the human race to go on 
1348,is it so very desirable 
1349,are we attractive as a species 
1350,not so very  he thought  looking at those rather untidy boys 
1351,his favourite  cam  was in bed  he supposed 
1352,foolish questions  vain questions  questions one never asked if one was occupied 
1353,is human life this 
1354,is human life that 
1355,one never had time to think about it 
1356,but here he was asking himself that sort of question  because mrs  ramsay was giving orders to servants  and also because it had struck him  thinking how surprised mrs  ramsay was that carrie manning should still exist  that friendships  even the best of them  are frail things 
1357,one drifts apart 
1358,he reproached himself again 
1359,he was sitting beside mrs  ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her 
1360, I am so sorry   said mrs  ramsy  turning to him at last 
1361,he felt rigid and barren  like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them 
1362,yet he must force his feet into them 
1363,he must make himself talk 
1364,unless he were very careful  she would find out this treachery of his  that he did not care a straw for her  and that would not be at all pleasant  he thought 
1365,so he bent his head courteously in her direction 
1366, how you must detest dining in this bear garden   she said  making use  as she did when she was distracted  of her social manner 
1367,so  when there is a strife of tongues  at some meeting  the chairman  to obtain unity  suggests that every one shall speak in french 
1368,perhaps it is bad french  french may not contain the words that express the speaker own thoughts  nevertheless speaking french imposes some order  some uniformity 
1369,replying to her in the same language  mr  bankes said   no  not at all   and mr  tansley  who had no knowledge of this language  even spoke thus in words of one syllable  at once suspected its insincerity 
1370,they did talk nonsense  he thought  the ramsays  and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy  making a note which  one of these days  he would read aloud  to one or two friends 
1371,there  in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe  staying with the ramsays  and what nonsense they talked 
1372,it was worth while doing it once  he would say  but not again 
1373,the women bored one so  he would say 
1374,of course ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children 
1375,it would shape itself something like that  but now  at this moment  sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him  nothing had shaped itself at all 
1376,it was all in scraps and fragments 
1377,he felt extremely  even physically  uncomfortable 
1378,he wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself 
1379,he wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair  looked at this person  then at that person  tried to break into their talk  opened his mouth and shut it again 
1380,they were talking about the fishing industry 
1381,why did no one ask him his opinion 
1382,what did they know about the fishing industry 
1383,lily briscoe knew all that 
1384,sitting opposite him  could she not see  as in an x ray photograph  the ribs and thigh bones of the young man own desire to impress himself  lying dark in the mist of his flesh   that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation 
1385,but  she thought  screwing up her chinese eyes  and remembering how he sneered at women   cannot paint  cannot write   why should i help him to relieve himself 
1386,there is a code of behaviour  she knew  whose seventh article  it may be  says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman  whatever her own occupation might be  to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones  the ribs  of his vanity  of his urgent desire to assert himself  as indeed it is their duty  she reflected  in her old maidenly fairness  to help us  suppose the tube were to burst into flames 
1387,then  she thought  i should certainly expect mr  tansley to get me out 
1388,but how would it be  she thought  if neither of us did either of these things 
1389,so she sat there smiling 
1390, you are not planning to go to the lighthouse  are you  lily   said mrs  ramsay 
1391, remember poor mr  langley  he had been round the world dozens of times  but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband took him there  are you a good sailor  mr  tansley   she asked 
1392,mr  tansley raised a hammer  swung it high in air  but realising  as it descended  that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this  said only that he had never been sick in his life 
1393,but in that one sentence lay compact  like gunpowder  that his grandfather was a fisherman  his father a chemist  that he had worked his way up entirely himself  that he was proud of it  that he was charles tansley   a fact that nobody there seemed to realise  but one of these days every single person would know it 
1394,he scowled ahead of him 
1395,he could almost pity these mild cultivated people  who would be blown sky high  like bales of wool and barrels of apples  one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him 
1396, will you take me  mr  tansley   said lily  quickly  kindly  for  of course  if mrs  ramsay said to her  as in effect she did   i am drowning  my dear  in seas of fire  unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there  life will run upon the rocks   indeed i hear the grating and the growling at this minute  my nerves are taut as fiddle strings  another touch and they will snap    when mrs  ramsay said all this  as the glance in her eyes said it  of course for the hundred and fiftieth time lily briscoe had to renounce the experiment   what happens if one is not nice to that young man there   and be nice 
1397,judging the turn in her mood correctly   that she was friendly to him now   he was relieved of his egotism  and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby  how his father used to fish him out with a boat hook  that was how he had learnt to swim 
1398,one of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the scottish coast  he said 
1399,he had been there with him in a storm 
1400,this was said loudly in a pause 
1401,they had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm 
1402,ah  thought lily briscoe  as the conversation took this auspicious turn  and she felt mrs  ramsay own gratitude  for mrs  ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself   ah  she thought  but what have not i paid to get it for you 
1403,she had not been sincere 
1404,she had done the usual trick   been nice 
1405,she would never know him 
1406,he would never know her 
1407,human relations were all like that  she thought  and the worst  if it had not been for mr  bankes  were between men and women 
1408,inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought 
1409,then her eye caught the salt cellar  which she had placed there to remind her  and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle  and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what mr  tansley was saying 
1410,let him talk all night if he liked it 
1411, but how long do they leave men on a lighthouse   she asked 
1412,he told her 
1413,he was amazingly well informed 
1414,and as he was grateful  and as he liked her  and as he was beginning to enjoy himself  so now  mrs  ramsay thought  she could return to that dream land  that unreal but fascinating place  the mannings  drawing room at marlow twenty years ago  where one moved about without haste or anxiety  for there was no future to worry about 
1415,she knew what had happened to them  what to her 
1416,it was like reading a good book again  for she knew the end of that story  since it had happened twenty years ago  and life  which shot down even from this dining room table in cascades  heaven knows where  was sealed up there  and lay  like a lake  placidly between its banks 
1417,he said they had built a billiard room   was it possible 
1418,would william go on talking about the mannings 
1419,she wanted him to 
1420,but  no   for some reason he was no longer in the mood 
1421,she tried 
1422,he did not respond 
1423,she could not force him 
1424,she was disappointed 
1425, the children are disgraceful   she said  sighing 
1426,he said something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not acquire until later in life 
1427, if at all   said mrs  ramsay merely to fill up space  thinking what an old maid william was becoming 
1428,conscious of his treachery  conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate  yet out of mood for it at present  he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life  sitting there  waiting 
1429,perhaps the others were saying something interesting 
1430,what were they saying 
1431,that the fishing season was bad  that the men were emigrating 
1432,they were talking about wages and unemployment 
1433,the young man was abusing the government 
1434,william bankes  thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable  heard him say something about  one of the most scandalous acts of the present government  
1435,lily was listening  mrs  ramsay was listening  they were all listening 
1436,but already bored  lily felt that something was lacking  mr  bankes felt that something was lacking 
1437,pulling her shawl round her mrs  ramsay felt that something was lacking 
1438,all of them bending themselves to listen thought   pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed   for each thought   the others are feeling this  they are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen  whereas  i feel nothing at all  
1439,but perhaps  thought mr  bankes  as he looked at mr  tansley  here is the man 
1440,one was always waiting for the man 
1441,there was always a chance 
1442,at any moment the leader might arise  the man of genius  in politics as in anything else 
1443,probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies  thought mr  bankes  doing his best to make allowances  for he knew by some curious physical sensation  as of nerves erect in his spine  that he was jealous  for himself partly  partly more probably for his work  for his point of view  for his science  and therefore he was not entirely open  minded or altogether fair  for mr  tansley seemed to be saying  you have wasted your lives 
1444,you are all of you wrong 
1445,poor old fogies  you are hopelessly behind the times 
1446,he seemed to be rather cocksure  this young man  and his manners were bad 
1447,but mr  bankes bade himself observe  he had courage  he had ability  he was extremely well up in the facts 
1448,probably  mr  bankes thought  as tansley abused the government  there is a good deal in what he says 
1449, tell me now     he said 
1450,so they argued about politics  and lily looked at the leaf on the table cloth  and mrs  ramsay  leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men  wondered why she was so bored by this talk  and wished  looking at her husband at the other end of the table  that he would say something 
1451,one word  she said to herself 
1452,for if he said a thing  it would make all the difference 
1453,he went to the heart of things 
1454,he cared about fishermen and their wages 
1455,he could not sleep for thinking of them 
1456,it was altogether different when he spoke  one did not feel then  pray heaven you do not see how little i care  because one did care 
1457,then  realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak  she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage  and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him 
1458,she looked at him thinking to find this in his face  he would be looking magnificent   but not in the least 
1459,he was screwing his face up  he was scowling and frowning  and flushing with anger 
1460,what on earth was it about 
1461,she wondered 
1462,what could be the matter 
1463,only that poor old augustus had asked for another plate of soup   that was all 
1464,it was unthinkable  it was detestable  so he signalled to her across the table  that augustus should be beginning his soup over again 
1465,he loathed people eating when he had finished 
1466,she saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes  his brow  and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode  and then   thank goodness  she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel  and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words 
1467,he sat there scowling 
1468,he had said nothing  he would have her observe 
1469,let her give him the credit for that 
1470,but why after all should poor augustus not ask for another plate of soup 
1471,he had merely touched ellen own arm and said 
1472, ellen  please  another plate of soup   and then mr  ramsay scowled like that 
1473,and why not 
1474,mrs  ramsay demanded 
1475,surely they could let augustus have his soup if he wanted it 
1476,he hated people wallowing in food  mr  ramsay frowned at her 
1477,he hated everything dragging on for hours like this 
1478,but he had controlled himself  mr  ramsay would have her observe  disgusting though the sight was 
1479,but why show it so plainly  mrs  ramsay demanded  they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across  each knowing exactly what the other felt  
1480,everybody could see  mrs  ramsay thought 
1481,there was rose gazing at her father  there was roger gazing at his father  both would be off in spasms of laughter in another second  she knew  and so she said promptly  indeed it was time  
1482, light the candles   and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled at the sideboard 
1483,why could he never conceal his feelings 
1484,mrs  ramsay wondered  and she wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed 
1485,perhaps he had  perhaps he had not 
1486,she could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there  drinking his soup 
1487,if he wanted soup  he asked for soup 
1488,whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same 
1489,he did not like her  she knew that  but partly for that very reason she respected him  and looking at him  drinking soup  very large and calm in the failing light  and monumental  and contemplative  she wondered what he did feel then  and why he was always content and dignified  and she thought how devoted he was to andrew  and would call him into his room  and andrew said   show him things  
1490,and there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry  till he reminded one of a cat watching birds  and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word  and her husband said   poor old augustus   he is a true poet   which was high praise from her husband 
1491,now eight candles were stood down the table  and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire  and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit 
1492,what had she done with it  mrs  ramsay wondered  for rose own arrangement of the grapes and pears  of the horny pink lined she will  of the bananas  made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea  of neptune own banquet  of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of bacchus  in some picture   among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold   thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth  was like a world in which one could take one own staff and climb hills  she thought  and go down into valleys  and to her pleasure  for it brought them into sympathy momentarily  she saw that augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit  plunged in  broke off a bloom there  a tassel here  and returned  after feasting  to his hive 
1493,that was his way of looking  different from hers 
1494,but looking together united them 
1495,now all the candles were lit up  and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light  and composed  as they had not been in the twilight  into a party round a table  for the night was now shut off by panes of glass  which  far from giving any accurate view of the outside world  rippled it so strangely that here  inside the room  seemed to be order and dry land  there  outside  a reflection in which things waved and vanished  waterily 
1496,some change at once went through them all  as if this had really happened  and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow  on an island  had their common because against that fluidity out there 
1497,mrs  ramsay  who had been uneasy  waiting for paul and minta to come in  and unable  she felt  to settle to things  now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation 
1498,for now they must come  and lily briscoe  trying to analyse the because of the sudden exhilaration  compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn  when solidity suddenly vanished  and such vast spaces lay between them  and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room  and the uncurtained windows  and the bright mask like look of faces seen by candlelight 
1499,some weight was taken off them  anything might happen  she felt 
1500,they must come now  mrs  ramsay thought  looking at the door  and at that instant  minta doyle  paul rayley  and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together 
1501,they were awfully late  they were horribly late  minta said  as they found their way to different ends of the table 
1502, i lost my brooch   my grandmother own brooch   said minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice  and a suffusion in her large brown eyes  looking down  looking up  as she sat by mr  ramsay  which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her 
1503,how could she be such a goose  he asked  as to scramble about the rocks in jewels 
1504,she was by way of being terrified of him   he was so fearfully clever  and the first night when she had sat by him  and he talked about george eliot  she had been really frightened  for she had left the third volume of middlemarch in the train and she never knew what happened in the end  but afterwards she got on perfectly  and made herself out even more ignorant than she was  because he liked telling her she was a fool 
1505,and so tonight  directly he laughed at her  she was not frightened 
1506,besides  she knew  directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened  she wore her golden haze 
1507,sometimes she had it  sometimes not 
1508,she never knew why it came or why it went  or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her 
1509,yes  tonight she had it  tremendously  she knew that by the way mr  ramsay told her not to be a fool 
1510,she sat beside him  smiling 
1511,it must have happened then  thought mrs  ramsay  they are engaged 
1512,and for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again   jealousy 
1513,for he  her husband  felt it too   minta own glow  he liked these girls  these golden reddish girls  with something flying  something a little wild and harum scarum about them  who did not  scrape their hair off   were not  as he said about poor lily briscoe   skimpy  
1514,there was some quality which she herself had not  some lustre  some richness  which attracted him  amused him  led him to make favourites of girls like minta 
1515,they might cut his hair from him  plait him watch chains  or interrupt him at his work  hailing him  she heard them    come along  mr  ramsay  it is our turn to beat them now   and out he came to play tennis 
1516,but indeed she was not jealous  only  now and then  when she made herself look in her glass  a little resentful that she had grown old  perhaps  by her own fault 
1517, the bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it  
1518,she was grateful to them for laughing at him 
1519,  how many pipes have you smoked today  mr  ramsay   and so on   till he seemed a young man  a man very attractive to women  not burdened  not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure  but again as she had first known him  gaunt but gallant  helping her out of a boat  she remembered  with delightful ways  like that  she looked at him  and he looked astonishingly young  teasing minta  
1520,for herself    put it down there   she said  helping the swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the boeuf en daube   for her own part  she liked her boobies 
1521,paul must sit by her 
1522,she had kept a place for him 
1523,really  she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best 
1524,they did not bother one with their dissertations 
1525,how much they missed  after all  these very clever men 
1526,how dried up they did become  to be sure 
1527,there was something  she thought as he sat down  very charming about paul 
1528,his manners were delightful to her  and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes 
1529,he was so considerate 
1530,would he tell her   now that they were all talking again   what had happened 
1531, we went back to look for minta own brooch   he said  sitting down by her 
1532, we    that was enough 
1533,she knew from the effort  the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said  we    we did this  we did that  
1534,they will say that all their lives  she thought  and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as marthe  with a little flourish  took the cover off 
1535,the cook had spent three days over that dish 
1536,and she must take great care  mrs  ramsay thought  diving into the soft mass  to choose a specially tender piece for william bankes 
1537,and she peered into the dish  with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine  and thought  this will celebrate the occasion   a curious sense rising in her  at once freakish and tender  of celebrating a festival  as if two emotions were called up in her  one profound   for what could be more serious than the love of man for woman  what more commanding  more impressive  bearing in its bosom the seeds of death  at the same time these lovers  these people entering into illusion glittering eyed  must be danced round with mockery  decorated with garlands 
1538, it is a triumph   said mr  bankes  laying his knife down for a moment 
1539,he had eaten attentively 
1540,it was rich  it was tender 
1541,it was perfectly cooked 
1542,how did she manage these things in the depths of the country 
1543,he asked her 
1544,she was a wonderful woman 
1545,all his love  all his reverence  had returned  and she knew it 
1546, it is a french recipe of my grandmother own   said mrs  ramsay  speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice 
1547,of course it was french 
1548,what passes for cookery in england is an abomination  they agreed  
1549,it is putting cabbages in water 
1550,it is roasting meat till it is like leather 
1551,it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables 
1552, in which   said mr  bankes   all the virtue of the vegetable is contained  
1553,and the waste  said mrs  ramsay 
1554,a whole french family could live on what an english cook throws away 
1555,spurred on by her sense that william own affection had come back to her  and that everything was all right again  and that her suspense was over  and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock  she laughed  she gesticulated  till lily thought  how childlike  how absurd she was  sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her  talking about the skins of vegetables 
1556,there was something frightening about her 
1557,she was irresistible 
1558,always she got her own way in the end  lily thought 
1559,now she had brought this off   paul and minta  one might suppose  were engaged 
1560,mr  bankes was dining here 
1561,she put a spell on them all  by wishing  so simply  so directly  and lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit  and supposed that it was partly that belief  for her face was all lit up   without looking young  she looked radiant  in this strange  this terrifying thing  which made paul rayley  sitting at her side  all of a tremor  yet abstract  absorbed  silent 
1562,mrs  ramsay  lily felt  as she talked about the skins of vegetables  exalted that  worshipped that  held her hands over it to warm them  to protect it  and yet  having brought it all about  somehow laughed  led her victims  lily felt  to the altar 
1563,it came over her too now   the emotion  the vibration  of love 
1564,how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul own side 
1565,he  glowing  burning  she  aloof  satirical  he  bound for adventure  she  moored to the shore  he  launched  incautious  she solitary  left out   and  ready to implore a share  if it were a disaster  in his disaster  she said shyly 
1566, when did minta lose her brooch  
1567,he smiled the most exquisite smile  veiled by memory  tinged by dreams 
1568,he shook his head 
1569, on the beach   he said 
1570, I am going to find it   he said   I am getting up early  
1571,this being kept secret from minta  he lowered his voice  and turned his eyes to where she sat  laughing  beside mr  ramsay 
1572,lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him  envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half hidden by some stone  and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers 
1573,but what did he reply to her offer 
1574,she actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear   let me come with you   and he laughed 
1575,he meant yes or no   either perhaps 
1576,but it was not his meaning   it was the odd chuckle he gave  as if he had said  throw yourself over the cliff if you like  i do not care 
1577,he turned on her cheek the heat of love  its horror  its cruelty  its unscrupulosity 
1578,it scorched her  and lily  looking at minta  being charming to mr  ramsay at the other end of the table  flinched for her exposed to these fangs  and was thankful 
1579,for at any rate  she said to herself  catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern  she need not marry  thank heaven  she need not undergo that degradation 
1580,she was saved from that dilution 
1581,she would move the tree rather more to the middle 
1582,such was the complexity of things 
1583,for what happened to her  especially staying with the ramsays  was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time  that is what you feel  was one  that is what i feel  was the other  and then they fought together in her mind  as now 
1584,it is so beautiful  so exciting  this love  that i tremble on the verge of it  and offer  quite out of my own habit  to look for a brooch on a beach  also it is the stupidest  the most barbaric of human passions  and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem own  paul own was exquisite  into a bully with a crowbar  he was swaggering  he was insolent  in the mile end road 
1585,yet  she said to herself  from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love  wreaths heaped and roses  and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this   love  while the women  judging from her own experience  would all the time be feeling  this is not what we want  there is nothing more tedious  puerile  and inhumane than this  yet it is also beautiful and necessary 
1586,well then  well then 
1587,she asked  somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument  as if in an argument like this one threw one own own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on 
1588,so she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love 
1589, then   said mr  bankes   there is that liquid the english call coffee  
1590, oh  coffee   said mrs  ramsay 
1591,but it was much rather a question  she was thoroughly roused  lily could see  and talked very emphatically  of real butter and clean milk 
1592,speaking with warmth and eloquence  she described the iniquity of the english dairy system  and in what state milk was delivered at the door  and was about to prove her charges  for she had gone into the matter  when all round the table  beginning with andrew in the middle  like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze  her children laughed  her husband laughed  she was laughed at  fire  encircled  and forced to veil her crest  dismount her batteries  and only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to mr  bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the british public 
1593,purposely  however  for she had it on her mind that lily  who had helped her with mr  tansley  was out of things  she exempted her from the rest  said  lily anyhow agrees with me   and so drew her in  a little fluttered  a little startled 
1594, for she was thinking about love  
1595,they were both out of things  mrs  ramsay had been thinking  both lily and charles tansley 
1596,both suffered from the glow of the other two 
1597,he  it was clear  felt himself utterly in the cold  no woman would look at him with paul rayley in the room 
1598,poor fellow 
1599,still  he had his dissertation  the influence of somebody upon something  he could take care of himself 
1600,with lily it was different 
1601,she faded  under minta own glow  became more inconspicuous than ever  in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little chinese eyes 
1602,everything about her was so small 
1603,yet  thought mrs  ramsay  comparing her with minta  as she claimed her help  for lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots   he would talk by the hour about his boots  of the two  lily at forty will be the better 
1604,there was in lily a thread of something  a flare of something  something of her own which mrs  ramsay liked very much indeed  but no man would  she feared 
1605,obviously  not  unless it were a much older man  like william bankes 
1606,but then he cared  well  mrs  ramsay sometimes thought that he cared  since his wife own death  perhaps for her 
1607,he was not  in love  of course  it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many 
1608,oh  but nonsense  she thought  william must marry lily 
1609,they have so many things in common 
1610,lily is so fond of flowers 
1611,they are both cold and aloof and rather self sufficing 
1612,she must arrange for them to take a long walk together 
1613,foolishly  she had set them opposite each other 
1614,that could be remedied tomorrow 
1615,if it were fine  they should go for a picnic 
1616,everything seemed possible 
1617,everything seemed right 
1618,just now  but this cannot last  she thought  dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots  just now she had reached security  she hovered like a hawk suspended  like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly  not noisily  solemnly rather  for it arose  she thought  looking at them all eating there  from husband and children and friends  all of which rising in this profound stillness  she was helping william bankes to one very small piece more  and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot  seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke  like a fume rising upwards  holding them safe together 
1619,nothing need be said  nothing could be said 
1620,there it was  all round them 
1621,it partook  she felt  carefully helping mr  bankes to a specially tender piece  of eternity  as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon  there is a coherence in things  a stability  something  she meant  is immune from change  and shines out  she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights  in the face of the flowing  the fleeting  the spectral  like a ruby  so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today  already  of peace  of rest 
1622,of such moments  she thought  the thing is made that endures 
1623, yes   she assured william bankes   there is plenty for everybody  
1624, andrew   she said   hold your plate lower  or i shall spill it    the boeuf en daube was a perfect triumph   here  she felt  putting the spoon down  where one could move or rest  could wait now  they were all helped  listening  could then  like a hawk which lapses suddenly from its high station  flaunt and sink on laughter easily  resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty three 
1625,that was the number  it seemed  on his watch 
1626,what did it all mean 
1627,to this day she had no notion 
1628,a square root 
1629,what was that 
1630,her sons knew 
1631,she leant on them  on cubes and square roots  that was what they were talking about now  on voltaire and madame de stael  on the character of napoleon  on the french system of land tenure  on lord rosebery  on creevey own memoirs  she let it uphold her and sustain her  this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence  which ran up and down  crossed this way and that  like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric  upholding the world  so that she could trust herself to it utterly  even shut her eyes  or flicker them for a moment  as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree 
1632,then she woke up 
1633,it was still being fabricated 
1634,william bankes was praising the waverly novels 
1635,he read one of them every six months  he said 
1636,and why should that make charles tansley angry 
1637,he rushed in  all  thought mrs  ramsay  because prue will not be nice to him  and denounced the waverly novels when he knew nothing about it  nothing about it whatsoever  mrs  ramsay thought  observing him rather than listening to what he said 
1638,she could see how it was from his manner   he wanted to assert himself  and so it would always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife  and so need not be always saying   i   i   i  
1639,for that was what his criticism of poor sir walter  or perhaps it was jane austen  amounted to 
1640, i    i    i  
1641,he was thinking of himself and the impression he was making  as she could tell by the sound of his voice  and his emphasis and his uneasiness 
1642,success would be good for him 
1643,at any rate they were off again 
1644,now she need not listen 
1645,it could not last  she knew  but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people  and their thoughts and their feelings  without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves  and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging  trembling 
1646,so she saw them  she heard them  but whatever they said had also this quality  as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when  at the same time  one can see the ripple and the gravel  something to the right  something to the left  and the whole is held together  for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another  she would be saying she liked the waverly novels or had not read them  she would be urging herself forward  now she said nothing 
1647,for the moment  she hung suspended 
1648, ah  but how long do you think it will last   said somebody 
1649,it was as if she had antennae trembling out from her  which  intercepting certain sentences  forced them upon her attention 
1650,this was one of them 
1651,she scented danger for her husband 
1652,a question like that would lead  almost certainly  to something being said which reminded him of his own failure 
1653,how long would he be read   he would think at once 
1654,william bankes  who was entirely free from all such vanity  laughed  and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion 
1655,who could tell what was going to last   in literature or indeed in anything else 
1656, let us enjoy what we do enjoy   he said 
1657,his integrity seemed to mrs  ramsay quite admirable 
1658,he never seemed for a moment to think  but how does this affect me 
1659,but then if you had the other temperament  which must have praise  which must have encouragement  naturally you began  and she knew that mr  ramsay was beginning  to be uneasy  to want somebody to say  oh  but your work will last  mr  ramsay  or something like that 
1660,he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying  with some irritation  that  anyhow  scott  or was it shakespeare    would last him his lifetime 
1661,he said it irritably 
1662,everybody  she thought  felt a little uncomfortable  without knowing why 
1663,then minta doyle  whose instinct was fine  said bluffly  absurdly  that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare 
1664,mr  ramsay said grimly  but his mind was turned away again  that very few people liked it as much as they said they did 
1665,but  he added  there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless  and mrs  ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow  he would laugh at minta  and she  mrs  ramsay saw  realising his extreme anxiety about himself  would  in her own way  see that he was taken care of  and praise him  somehow or other 
1666,but she wished it was not necessary  perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary 
1667,anyhow  she was free now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy 
1668,they lasted  he said 
1669,he had read some of tolstoi at school 
1670,there was one he always remembered  but he had forgotten the name 
1671,russian names were impossible  said mrs  ramsay 
1672, vronsky   said paul 
1673,he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain 
1674, vronsky   said mrs  ramsay   oh  anna karenina   but that did not take them very far  books were not in their line 
1675,no  charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books  but it was all so mixed up with  am i saying the right thing 
1676,am i making a good impression 
1677,that  after all  one knew more about him than about tolstoi  whereas  what paul said was about the thing  simply  not himself  nothing else 
1678,like all stupid people  he had a kind of modesty too  a consideration for what you were feeling  which  once in a way at least  she found attractive 
1679,now he was thinking  not about himself  or about tolstoi  but whether she was cold  whether she felt a draught  whether she would like a pear 
1680,no  she said  she did not want a pear 
1681,indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit  without realising it  jealously  hoping that nobody would touch it 
1682,her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit  among the rich purples of the lowland grapes  then over the horny ridge of the she will  putting a yellow against a purple  a curved shape against a round shape  without knowing why she did it  or why  every time she did it  she felt more and more serene  until  oh  what a pity that they should do it   a hand reached out  took a pear  and spoilt the whole thing 
1683,in sympathy she looked at rose 
1684,she looked at rose sitting between jasper and prue 
1685,how odd that one own child should do that 
1686,how odd to see them sitting there  in a row  her children  jasper  rose  prue  andrew  almost silent  but with some joke of their own going on  she guessed  from the twitching at their lips 
1687,it was something quite apart from everything else  something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room 
1688,it was not about their father  she hoped 
1689,no  she thought not 
1690,what was it  she wondered  sadly rather  for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there 
1691,there was all that hoarded behind those rather set  still  mask like faces  for they did not join in easily  they were like watchers  surveyors  a little raised or set apart from the grown up people 
1692,but when she looked at prue tonight  she saw that this was not now quite true of her 
1693,she was just beginning  just moving  just descending 
1694,the faintest light was on her face  as if the glow of minta opposite  some excitement  some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her  as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table cloth  and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it 
1695,she kept looking at minta  shyly  yet curiously  so that mrs  ramsay looked from one to the other and said  speaking to prue in her own mind  you will be as happy as she is one of these days 
1696,you will be much happier  she added  because you are my daughter  she meant  her own daughter must be happier than other people own daughters 
1697,but dinner was over 
1698,it was time to go 
1699,they were only playing with things on their plates 
1700,she would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling 
1701,he was having a joke with minta about a bet 
1702,then she would get up 
1703,she liked charles tansley  she thought  suddenly  she liked his laugh 
1704,she liked him for being so angry with paul and minta 
1705,she liked his awkwardness 
1706,there was a lot in that young man after all 
1707,and lily  she thought  putting her napkin beside her plate  she always has some joke of her own 
1708,one need never bother about lily 
1709,she waited 
1710,she tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate 
1711,well  were they done now 
1712,that story had led to another story 
1713,her husband was in great spirits tonight  and wishing  she supposed  to make it all right with old augustus after that scene about the soup  had drawn him in   they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college 
1714,she looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black  and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely  as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral  for she did not listen to the words 
1715,the sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice  minta own  speaking alone  reminded her of men and boys crying out the latin words of a service in some roman catholic cathedral 
1716,she waited 
1717,her husband spoke 
1718,he was repeating something  and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation  and melancholy in his voice 
1719,come out and climb the garden path  luriana lurilee 
1720,the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee 
1721,the words  she was looking at the window  sounded as if they were floating like flowers on water out there  cut off from them all  as if no one had said them  but they had come into existence of themselves 
1722,and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves 
1723,she did not know what they meant  but  like music  the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice  outside her self  saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things 
1724,she knew  without looking round  that every one at the table was listening to the voice saying 
1725,i wonder if it seems to you  luriana  lurilee
1726,with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had  as if this were  at last  the natural thing to say  this were their own voice speaking 
1727,but the voice had stopped 
1728,she looked round 
1729,she made herself get up 
1730,augustus carmichael had risen and  holding his table napkin so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting 
1731,to see the kings go riding by over lawn and daisy lea with their palm leaves and cedar luriana  lurilee 
1732,and as she passed him  he turned slightly towards her repeating the last words 
1733,luriana  lurilee
1734,and bowed to her as if he did her homage 
1735,without knowing why  she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before  and with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through the door which he held open for her 
1736,it was necessary now to carry everything a step further 
1737,with her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked  and then  as she moved and took minta own arm and left the room  it changed  it shaped itself differently  it had become  she knew  giving one last look at it over her shoulder  already the past 
1738,as usual  lily thought 
1739,there was always something that had to be done at that precise moment  something that mrs  ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly  it might be with every one standing about making jokes  as now  not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking room  into the drawing room  up to the attics 
1740,then one saw mrs  ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with minta own arm in hers  bethink her   yes  it is time for that now   and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do something alone 
1741,and directly she went a sort of disintegration set in  they wavered about  went different ways  mr  bankes took charles tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics  thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening  making the weight fall in a different direction  as if  lily thought  seeing them go  and hearing a word or two about the policy of the labour party  they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings  the change from poetry to politics struck her like that  so mr  bankes and charles mrs  ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone 
1742,where  lily wondered  was she going so quickly 
1743,not that she did in fact run or hurry  she went indeed rather slowly 
1744,she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter  and pick out one particular thing  the thing that mattered  to detach it  separate it off  clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things  and so hold it before her  and bring it to the tribunal where  ranged about in conclave  sat the judges she had set up to decide these things 
1745,is it good  is it bad  is it right or wrong 
1746,where are we all going to 
1747,and so on 
1748,so she righted herself after the shock of the event  and quite unconsciously and incongruously  used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position 
1749,her world was changing  they were still 
1750,the event had given her a sense of movement 
1751,all must be in order 
1752,she must get that right and that right  she thought  insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees  stillness  and now again of the superb upward rise  like the beak of a ship up a wave  of the elm branches as the wind raised them 
1753,for it was windy  she stood a moment to look out  
1754,it was windy  so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star  and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves 
1755,yes  that was done then  accomplished  and as with all things done  became solemn 
1756,now one thought of it  cleared of chatter and emotion  it seemed always to have been  only was shown now and so being shown  struck everything into stability 
1757,they would  she thought  going on again  however long they lived  come back to this night  this moon  this wind  this house  and to her too 
1758,it flattered her  where she was most susceptible of flattery  to think how  wound about in their hearts  however long they lived she would be woven  and this  and this  and this  she thought  going upstairs  laughing  but affectionately  at the sofa on the landing  her mother own   at the rocking chair  her father own   at the map of the hebrides 
1759,all that would be revived again in the lives of paul and minta   the rayleys    she tried the new name over  and she felt  with her hand on the nursery door  that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically  the feeling was one of relief and happiness  it was all one stream  and chairs  tables  maps  were hers  were theirs  it did not matter whose  and paul and minta would carry it on when she was dead 
1760,she turned the handle  firmly  lest it should squeak  and went in  pursing her lips slightly  as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud 
1761,but directly she came in she saw  with annoyance  that the precaution was not needed 
1762,the children were not asleep 
1763,it was most annoying 
1764,mildred should be more careful 
1765,there was james wide awake and cam sitting bolt upright  and mildred out of bed in her bare feet  and it was almost eleven and they were all talking 
1766,what was the matter 
1767,it was that horrid skull again 
1768,she had told mildred to move it  but mildred  of course  had forgotten  and now there was cam wide awake  and james wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago 
1769,what had possessed edward to send them this horrid skull 
1770,she had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there 
1771,it was nailed fast  mildred said  and cam could not go to sleep with it in the room  and james screamed if she touched it 
1772,then cam must go to sleep  it had great horns said cam    must go to sleep and dream of lovely palaces  said mrs  ramsay  sitting down on the bed by her side 
1773,she could see the horns  cam said  all over the room 
1774,it was true 
1775,wherever they put the light  and james could not sleep without a light  there was always a shadow somewhere 
1776, but think  cam  it is only an old pig   said mrs  ramsay   a nice black pig like the pigs at the farm  
1777,but cam thought it was a horrid thing  branching at her all over the room 
1778, well then   said mrs  ramsay   we will cover it up   and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers  and open the little drawers quickly one after another  and not seeing anything that would do  she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull  round and round and round  and then she came back to cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside cam own and said how lovely it looked now  how the fairies would love it  it was like a bird own nest  it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad  with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes and   she could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in cam own mind  and cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain  a bird own nest  a garden  and there were little antelopes  and her eyes were opening and shutting  and mrs  ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously  and more rhythmically and more nonsensically  how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens  and everything lovely  she said  raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically  until she sat upright and saw that cam was asleep 
1779,now  she whispered  crossing over to his bed  james must go to sleep too  for see  she said  the boar own skull was still there  they had not touched it  they had done just what he wanted  it was there quite unhurt 
1780,he made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl 
1781,but he wanted to ask her something more 
1782,would they go to the lighthouse tomorrow 
1783,no  not tomorrow  she said  but soon  she promised him  the next fine day 
1784,he was very good 
1785,he lay down 
1786,she covered him up 
1787,but he would never forget  she knew  and she felt angry with charles tansley  with her husband  and with herself  for she had raised his hopes 
1788,then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar own skull  she got up  and pulled the window down another inch or two  and heard the wind  and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out 
1789,she hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads  she thought  still thinking how annoying charles tansley was 
1790,for neither of them slept well  they were excitable children  and since he said things like that about the lighthouse  it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over  just as they were going to sleep  clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow 
1791,for she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work 
1792,yet he looked so desolate  yet she would feel relieved when he went  yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow  yet he was admirable with her husband  yet his manners certainly wanted improving  yet she liked his laugh   thinking this  as she came downstairs  she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window   the yellow harvest moon   and turned  and they saw her  standing above them on the stairs 
1793, that is my mother   thought prue 
1794,yes  minta should look at her  paul rayley should look at her 
1795,that is the thing itself  she felt  as if there were only one person like that in the world  her mother 
1796,and  from having been quite grown up  a moment before  talking with the others  she became a child again  and what they had been doing was a game  and would her mother sanction their game  or condemn it  she wondered 
1797,and thinking what a chance it was for minta and paul and lily to see her  and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her  to have her  and how she would never grow up and never leave home  she said  like a child   we thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves  
1798,instantly  for no reason at all  mrs  ramsay became like a girl of twenty  full of gaiety 
1799,a mood of revelry suddenly took possession of her 
1800,of course they must go  of course they must go  she cried  laughing  and running down the last three or four steps quickly  she began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing minta own wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too  and would they be very late  and had any of them got a watch 
1801, yes  paul has   said minta 
1802,paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out of a little wash leather case to show her 
1803,and as he held it in the palm of his hand before her  he felt   she knows all about it  i need not say anything  
1804,he was saying to her as he showed her the watch   I have done it  mrs  ramsay  i owe it all to you  
1805,and seeing the gold watch lying in his hand  mrs  ramsay felt  how extraordinarily lucky minta is 
1806,she is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash  leather bag 
1807, how i wish i could come with you   she cried 
1808,but she was withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was 
1809,of course it was impossible for her to go with them 
1810,but she would have liked to go  had it not been for the other thing  and tickled by the absurdity of her thought  how lucky to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch  she went with a smile on her lips into the other room  where her husband sat reading 
1811,of course  she said to herself  coming into the room  she had to come here to get something she wanted 
1812,first she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp 
1813,but she wanted something more  though she did not know  could not think what it was that she wanted 
1814,she looked at her husband  taking up her stocking and beginning to knit   and saw that he did not want to be interrupted   that was clear 
1815,he was reading something that moved him very much 
1816,he was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion 
1817,he was tossing the pages over 
1818,he was acting it   perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book 
1819,she wondered what book it was 
1820,oh  it was one of old sir walter own she saw  adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting 
1821,for charles tansley had been saying  she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above   had been saying that people do not read scott any more 
1822,then her husband thought   that is what they will say of me   so he went and got one of those books 
1823,and if he came to the conclusion  that is true  what charles tansley said  he would accept it about scott 
1824, she could see that he was weighing  considering  putting this with that as he read  
1825,but not about himself 
1826,he was always uneasy about himself 
1827,that troubled her 
1828,he would always be worrying about his own books   will they be read  are they good  why are not they better  what do people think of me 
1829,not liking to think of him so  and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting  wondering if the children were laughing at that  she twitched the stockings out  and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead  and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now  when the breeze falls  settles  leaf by leaf  into quiet 
1830,it did not matter  any of it  she thought 
1831,a great man  a great book  fame   who could tell 
1832,she knew nothing about it 
1833,but it was his way with him  his truthfulness   for instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively  if only he would speak 
1834,she had complete trust in him 
1835,and dismissing all this  as one passes in diving now a weed  now a straw  now a bubble  she felt again  sinking deeper  as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking  there is something i want   something i have come to get  and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was  with her eyes closed 
1836,and she waited a little  knitting  wondering  and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner   the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee   began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically  and as they washed  words  like little shaded lights  one red  one blue  one yellow  lit up in the dark of her mind  and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across  or to cry out and to be echoed  so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book 
1837,and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be  are full of trees and changing leaves 
1838,she murmured  sticking her needles into the stocking 
1839,and she opened the book and began reading here and there at random  and as she did so  she felt that she was climbing backwards  upwards  shoving her way up under petals that curved over her  so that she only knew this is white  or this is red 
1840,she did not know at first what the words meant at all 
1841,steer  hither steer your winged pines  all beaten mariners
1842,she read and turned the page  swinging herself  zigzagging this way and that  from one line to another as from one branch to another  from one red and white flower to another  until a little sound roused her   her husband slapping his thighs 
1843,their eyes met for a second  but they did not want to speak to each other 
1844,they had nothing to say  but something seemed  nevertheless  to go from him to her 
1845,it was the life  it was the power of it  it was the tremendous humour  she knew  that made him slap his thighs 
1846,do not interrupt me  he seemed to be saying  do not say anything  just sit there 
1847,and he went on reading 
1848,his lips twitched 
1849,it filled him 
1850,it fortified him 
1851,he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening  and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably  and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they did not exist at all 
1852,but now  he felt  it did not matter a damn who reached z  if thought ran like an alphabet from a to z  
1853,somebody would reach it   if not he  then another 
1854,this man own strength and sanity  his feeling for straight forward simple things  these fishermen  the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit own cottage made him feel so vigorous  so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears 
1855,raising the book a little to hide his face  he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely  but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott own hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view   forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie own drowning and mucklebackit own sorrow  that was scott at his best  and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him 
1856,well  let them improve upon that  he thought as he finished the chapter 
1857,he felt that he had been arguing with somebody  and had got the better of him 
1858,they could not improve upon that  whatever they might say  and his own position became more secure 
1859,the lovers were fiddlesticks  he thought  collecting it all in his mind again 
1860,that is fiddlesticks  that is first rate  he thought  putting one thing beside another 
1861,but he must read it again 
1862,he could not remember the whole shape of the thing 
1863,he had to keep his judgement in suspense 
1864,so he returned to the other thought   if young men did not care for this  naturally they did not care for him either 
1865,one ought not to complain  thought mr  ramsay  trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him 
1866,but he was determined  he would not bother her again 
1867,here he looked at her reading 
1868,she looked very peaceful  reading 
1869,he liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone 
1870,the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman  he thought  returning to scott and balzac  to the english novel and the french novel 
1871,mrs  ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would  she really would  but otherwise  might she go on sleeping  just a little longer  just a little longer 
1872,she was climbing up those branches  this way and that  laying hands on one flower and then another 
1873,nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 
1874,she read  and so reading she was ascending  she felt  on to the top  on to the summit 
1875,how satisfying 
1876,how restful 
1877,all the odds and ends of the day stuck to this magnet  her mind felt swept  felt clean 
1878,and then there it was  suddenly entire  she held it in her hands  beautiful and reasonable  clear and complete  here   the sonnet 
1879,but she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her 
1880,he was smiling at her  quizzically  as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight  but at the same time he was thinking  go on reading 
1881,you do not look sad now  he thought 
1882,and he wondered what she was reading  and exaggerated her ignorance  her simplicity  for he liked to think that she was not clever  not book learned at all 
1883,he wondered if she understood what she was reading 
1884,probably not  he thought 
1885,she was astonishingly beautiful 
1886,her beauty seemed to him  if that were possible  to increase
1887,yet seem d it winter still  and  you away 
1888,as with your shadow i with these did play  she finished 
1889, well   she said  echoing his smile dreamily  looking up from her book 
1890,as with your shadow i with these did play 
1891,she murmured  putting the book on the table 
1892,what had happened  she wondered  as she took up her knitting  since she had seen him alone 
1893,she remembered dressing  and seeing the moon  andrew holding his plate too high at dinner  being depressed by something william had said  the birds in the trees  the sofa on the landing  the children being awake  charles tansley waking them with his books falling   oh  no  that she had invented  and paul having a wash  leather case for his watch 
1894,which should she tell him about 
1895, they are engaged   she said  beginning to knit   paul and minta  
1896, so i guessed   he said 
1897,there was nothing very much to be said about it 
1898,her mind was still going up and down  up and down with the poetry  he was still feeling very vigorous  very forthright  after reading about steenie own funeral 
1899,so they sat silent 
1900,then she became aware that she wanted him to say something 
1901,anything  anything  she thought  going on with her knitting 
1902,anything will do 
1903, how nice it would be to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch   she said  for that was the sort of joke they had together 
1904,he snorted 
1905,he felt about this engagement as he always felt about any engagement  the girl is much too good for that young man 
1906,slowly it came into her head  why is it then that one wants people to marry 
1907,what was the value  the meaning of things 
1908, every word they said now would be true  
1909,do say something  she thought  wishing only to hear his voice 
1910,for the shadow  the thing folding them in was beginning  she felt  to close round her again 
1911,say anything  she begged  looking at him  as if for help 
1912,he was silent  swinging the compass on his watch chain to and fro  and thinking of scott own novels and balzac own novels 
1913,but through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy  for they were drawing together  involuntarily  coming side by side  quite close  she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind  and he was beginning  now that her thoughts took a turn he disliked   towards this  pessimism  as he called it   to fidget  though he said nothing  raising his hand to his forehead  twisting a lock of hair  letting it fall again 
1914, you will not finish that stocking tonight   he said  pointing to her stocking 
1915,that was what she wanted   the asperity in his voice reproving her 
1916,if he says it is wrong to be pessimistic probably it is wrong  she thought  the marriage will turn out all right 
1917, no   she said  flattening the stocking out upon her knee   i shall not finish it  
1918,and what then 
1919,for she felt that he was still looking at her  but that his look had changed 
1920,he wanted something   wanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him  wanted her to tell him that she loved him 
1921,and that  no  she could not do 
1922,he found talking so much easier than she did 
1923,he could say things   she never could 
1924,so naturally it was always he that said the things  and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly  and would reproach her 
1925,a heartless woman he called her  she never told him that she loved him 
1926,but it was not so   it was not so 
1927,it was only that she never could say what she felt 
1928,was there no crumb on his coat 
1929,nothing she could do for him 
1930,getting up  she stood at the window with the reddish brown stocking in her hands  partly to turn away from him  partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is   the sea at night 
1931,but she knew that he had turned his head as she turned  he was watching her 
1932,she knew that he was thinking  you are more beautiful than ever 
1933,and she felt herself very beautiful 
1934,will you not tell me just for once that you love me 
1935,he was thinking that  for he was roused  what with minta and his book  and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the lighthouse 
1936,but she could not do it  she could not say it 
1937,then  knowing that he was watching her  instead of saying anything she turned  holding her stocking  and looked at him 
1938,and as she looked at him she began to smile  for though she had not said a word  he knew  of course he knew  that she loved him 
1939,he could not deny it 
1940,and smiling she looked out of the window and said  thinking to herself  nothing on earth can equal this happiness   
1941, yes  you were right  it is going to be wet tomorrow  you will not be able to go  
1942,and she looked at him smiling 
1943,for she had triumphed again 
1944,she had not said it  yet he knew 
1945, well  we must wait for the future to show   said mr  bankes  coming in from the terrace 
1946, it is almost too dark to see   said andrew  coming up from the beach 
1947, one can hardly tell which is the sea and which is the land   said prue 
1948, do we leave that light burning   said lily as they took their coats off indoors 
1949, no   said prue   not if every one own in  
1950, andrew   she called back   just put out the light in the hall  
1951,one by one the lamps were all extinguished  except that mr  carmichael  who liked to lie awake a little reading virgil  kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest 
1952,so with the lamps all put out  the moon sunk  and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began 
1953,nothing  it seemed  could survive the flood  the profusion of darkness which  creeping in at keyholes and crevices  stole round window blinds  came into bedrooms  swallowed up here a jug and basin  there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias  there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers 
1954,not only was furniture confounded  there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by which one could say   this is he  or  this is she  
1955,sometimes a hand was raised as if to clutch something or ward off something  or somebody groaned  or somebody laughed aloud as if sharing a joke with nothingness 
1956,nothing stirred in the drawing room or in the dining room or on the staircase 
1957,only through the rusty hinges and swollen sea moistened woodwork certain airs  detached from the body of the wind  the house was ramshackle after all  crept round corners and ventured indoors 
1958,almost one might imagine them  as they entered the drawing room questioning and wondering  toying with the flap of hanging wall paper  asking  would it hang much longer  when would it fall 
1959,then smoothly brushing the walls  they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall paper whether they would fade  and questioning  gently  for there was time at their disposal  the torn letters in the wastepaper basket  the flowers  the books  all of which were now open to them and asking  were they allies 
1960,were they enemies 
1961,how long would they endure 
1962,so some random light directing them with its pale footfall upon stair and mat  from some uncovered star  or wandering ship  or the lighthouse even  with its pale footfall upon stair and mat  the little airs mounted the staircase and nosed round bedroom doors 
1963,but here surely  they must cease 
1964,whatever else may perish and disappear  what lies here is steadfast 
1965,here one might say to those sliding lights  those fumbling airs that breathe and bend over the bed itself  here you can neither touch nor destroy 
1966,upon which  wearily  ghostlily  as if they had feather light fingers and the light persistency of feathers  they would look  once  on the shut eyes  and the loosely clasping fingers  and fold their garments wearily and disappear 
1967,and so  nosing  rubbing  they went to the window on the staircase  to the servants  bedrooms  to the boxes in the attics  descending  blanched the apples on the dining room table  fumbled the petals of roses  tried the picture on the easel  brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor 
1968,at length  desisting  all ceased together  gathered together  all sighed together  all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to which some door in the kitchen replied  swung wide  admitted nothing  and slammed to 
1969,here mr  carmichael  who was reading virgil  blew out his candle 
1970,it was past midnight 
1971,but what after all is one night 
1972,a short space  especially when the darkness dims so soon  and so soon a bird sings  a cock crows  or a faint green quickens  like a turning leaf  in the hollow of the wave 
1973,night  however  succeeds to night 
1974,the winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally  evenly  with indefatigable fingers 
1975,they lengthen  they darken 
1976,some of them hold aloft clear planets  plates of brightness 
1977,the autumn trees  ravaged as they are  take on the flash of tattered flags kindling in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in indian sands 
1978,the autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight  in the light of harvest moons  the light which mellows the energy of labour  and smooths the stubble  and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore 
1979,it seemed now as if  touched by human penitence and all its toil  divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it  single  distinct  the hare erect  the wave falling  the boat rocking  which  did we deserve them  should be ours always 
1980,but alas  divine goodness  twitching the cord  draws the curtain  it does not please him  he covers his treasures in a drench of hail  and so breaks them  so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth 
1981,for our penitence deserves a glimpse only  our toil respite only 
1982,the nights now are full of wind and destruction  the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths 
1983,also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself  and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts  a sharer of his solitude  throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand  no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul 
1984,the hand dwindles in his hand  the voice bellows in his ear 
1985,almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what  and why  and wherefore  which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer 
1986,mr  ramsay  stumbling along a passage one dark morning  stretched his arms out  but mrs  ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before  his arms  though stretched out  remained empty 
1987,so with the house empty and the doors locked and the mattresses rolled round  those stray airs  advance guards of great armies  blustered in  brushed bare boards  nibbled and fanned  met nothing in bedroom or drawing room that wholly resisted them but only hangings that flapped  wood that creaked  the bare legs of tables  saucepans and china already furred  tarnished  cracked 
1988,what people had she would and left   a pair of shoes  a shooting cap  some faded skirts and coats in wardrobes   those alone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated  how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons  how once the looking glass had held a face  had held a world hollowed out in which a figure turned  a hand flashed  the door opened  in came children rushing and tumbling  and went out again 
1989,now  day after day  light turned  like a flower reflected in water  its sharp image on the wall opposite 
1990,only the shadows of the trees  flourishing in the wind  made obeisance on the wall  and for a moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself  or birds  flying  made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor 
1991,so loveliness reigned and stillness  and together made the shape of loveliness itself  a form from which life had parted  solitary like a pool at evening  far distant  seen from a train window  vanishing so quickly that the pool  pale in the evening  is scarcely robbed of its solitude  though once seen 
1992,loveliness and stillness clasped hands in the bedroom  and among the shrouded jugs and sheeted chairs even the prying of the wind  and the soft nose of the clammy sea airs  rubbing  snuffling  iterating  and reiterating their questions    will you fade  will you perish     scarcely disturbed the peace  the indifference  the air of pure integrity  as if the question they asked scarcely needed that they should answer  we remain 
1993,nothing it seemed could break that image  corrupt that innocence  or disturb the swaying mantle of silence which  week after week  in the empty room  wove into itself the falling cries of birds  ships hooting  the drone and hum of the fields  a dog own bark  a man own shout  and folded them round the house in silence 
1994,once only a board sprang on the landing  once in the middle of the night with a roar  with a rupture  as after centuries of quiescence  a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley  one fold of the shawl loosened and swung to and fro 
1995,then again peace descended  and the shadow wavered  light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall  and mrs  mcnab  tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood in the wash tub  grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle  came as directed to open all windows  and dust the bedrooms 
1996,as she lurched  for she rolled like a ship at sea  and leered  for her eyes fell on nothing directly  but with a sidelong glance that deprecated the scorn and anger of the world   she was witless  she knew it   as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself upstairs and rolled from room to room  she sang 
1997,rubbing the glass of the long looking glass and leering sideways at her swinging figure a sound issued from her lips   something that had been gay twenty years before on the stage perhaps  had been hummed and danced to  but now  coming from the toothless  bonneted  care taking woman  was robbed of meaning  was like the voice of witlessness  humour  persistency itself  trodden down but springing up again  so that as she lurched  dusting  wiping  she seemed to say how it was one long sorrow and trouble  how it was getting up and going to bed again  and bringing things out and putting them away again 
1998,it was not easy or snug this world she had known for close on seventy years 
1999,bowed down she was with weariness 
2000,how long  she asked  creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed  dusting the boards  how long shall it endure 
2001,but hobbled to her feet again  pulled herself up  and again with her sidelong leer which slipped and turned aside even from her own face  and her own sorrows  stood and gaped in the glass  aimlessly smiling  and began again the old amble and hobble  taking up mats  putting down china  looking sideways in the glass  as if  after all  she had her consolations  as if indeed there twined about her dirge some incorrigible hope 
2002,visions of joy there must have been at the wash  tub  say with her children  yet two had been base born and one had deserted her   at the public house  drinking  turning over scraps in her drawers 
2003,some cleavage of the dark there must have been  some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her  turning to her job again  mumble out the old music hall song 
2004,the mystic  the visionary  walking the beach on a fine night  stirring a puddle  looking at a stone  asking themselves  what am i    what is this   had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them   they could not say what it was  so that they were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert 
2005,but mrs  mcnab continued to drink and gossip as before 
2006,the spring without a leaf to toss  bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity  scornful in her purity  was laid out on fields wide  eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by the beholders 
2007,prue ramsay  leaning on her father own arm  was given in marriage 
2008,what  people said  could have been more fitting 
2009,and  they added  how beautiful she looked 
2010,as summer neared  as the evenings lengthened  there came to the wakeful  the hopeful  walking the beach  stirring the pool  imaginations of the strangest kind   of flesh turned to atoms which drove before the wind  of stars flashing in their hearts  of cliff  sea  cloud  and sky brought purposely together to assemble outwardly the scattered parts of the vision within 
2011,in those mirrors  the minds of men  in those pools of uneasy water  in which clouds for ever turn and shadows form  dreams persisted  and it was impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull  flower  tree  man and woman  and the white earth itself seemed to declare  but if questioned at once to withdraw  that good triumphs  happiness prevails  order rules  or to resist the extraordinary stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute good  some crystal of intensity  remote from the known pleasures and familiar virtues  something alien to the processes of domestic life  single  hard  bright  like a diamond in the sand  which would render the possessor secure 
2012,moreover  softened and acquiescent  the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak about her  veiled her eyes  averted her head  and among passing shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of the sorrows of mankind 
2013,prue ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth  which was indeed a tragedy  people said  everything  they said  had promised so well 
2014,and now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house again 
2015,flies wove a web in the sunny rooms  weeds that had grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane 
2016,when darkness fell  the stroke of the lighthouse  which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness  tracing its pattern  came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again 
2017,but in the very lull of this loving caress  as the long stroke leant upon the bed  the rock was rent asunder  another fold of the shawl loosened  there it hung  and swayed 
2018,through the short summer nights and the long summer days  when the empty rooms seemed to murmur with the echoes of the fields and the hum of flies  the long streamer waved gently  swayed aimlessly  while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that mrs  mcnab  when she broke in and lurched about  dusting  sweeping  looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun lanced waters 
2019,but slumber and sleep though it might there came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of hammers dulled on felt  which  with their repeated shocks still further loosened the shawl and cracked the tea cups 
2020,now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too 
2021,then again silence fell  and then  night after night  and sometimes in plain mid day when the roses were bright and light turned on the wall its shape clearly there seemed to drop into this silence  this indifference  this integrity  the thud of something falling 
2022,a she will exploded 
2023,twenty or thirty young men were blown up in france  among them andrew ramsay  whose death  mercifully  was instantaneous 
2024,at that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask of the sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they affirmed had to consider among the usual tokens of divine bounty   the sunset on the sea  the pallor of dawn  the moon rising  fishing boats against the moon  and children making mud pies or pelting each other with handfuls of grass  something out of harmony with this jocundity and this serenity 
2025,there was the silent apparition of an ashen coloured ship for instance  come  gone  there was a purplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if something had boiled and bled  invisibly  beneath 
2026,this intrusion into a scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the most comfortable conclusions stayed their pacing 
2027,it was difficult blandly to overlook them  to abolish their significance in the landscape  to continue  as one walked by the sea  to marvel how beauty outside mirrored beauty within 
2028,did nature supplement what man advanced 
2029,did she complete what he began 
2030,with equal complacence she saw his misery  his meanness  and his torture 
2031,that dream  of sharing  completing  of finding in solitude on the beach an answer  was then but a reflection in a mirror  and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath 
2032,impatient  despairing yet loth to go  for beauty offers her lures  has her consolations   to pace the beach was impossible  contemplation was unendurable  the mirror was broken 
2033,mr  carmichael brought out a volume of poems that spring  which had an unexpected success 
2034,the war  people said  had revived their interest in poetry 
2035,night after night  summer and winter  the torment of storms  the arrow  like stillness of fine  had there been any one to listen  from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing  as the winds and waves disported themselves like the amorphous bulks of leviathans whose brows are pierced by no light of reason  and mounted one on top of another  and lunged and plunged in the darkness or the daylight  for night and day  month and year ran shapelessly together  in idiot games  until it seemed as if the universe were battling and tumbling  in brute confusion and wanton lust aimlessly by itself 
2036,in spring the garden urns  casually filled with wind blown plants  were gay as ever 
2037,violets came and daffodils 
2038,but the stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night  with the trees standing there  and the flowers standing there  looking before them  looking up  yet beholding nothing  eyeless  and so terrible 
2039,thinking no harm  for the family would not come  never again  some said  and the house would be sold at michaelmas perhaps  mrs  mcnab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her 
2040,she laid them on the table while she dusted 
2041,she was fond of flowers 
2042,it was a pity to let them waste 
2043,suppose the house were sold  she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking glass  it would want seeing to   it would 
2044,there it had stood all these years without a soul in it 
2045,the books and things were mouldy  for  what with the war and help being hard to get  the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished 
2046,it was beyond one person own strength to get it straight now 
2047,she was too old 
2048,her legs pained her 
2049,all those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun  there was plaster fallen in the hall  the rain pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in  the carpet was ruined quite 
2050,but people should come themselves  they should have sent somebody down to see 
2051,for there were clothes in the cupboards  they had left clothes in all the bedrooms 
2052,what was she to do with them 
2053,they had the moth in them   mrs  ramsay own things 
2054,poor lady 
2055,she would never want them again 
2056,she was dead  they said  years ago  in london 
2057,there was the old grey cloak she wore gardening  mrs  mcnab fingered it  
2058,she could see her  as she came up the drive with the washing  stooping over her flowers  the garden was a pitiful sight now  all run to riot  and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds    she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak 
2059,there were boots and shoes  and a brush and comb left on the dressing table  for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow 
2060, she had died very sudden at the end  they said  
2061,and once they had been coming  but had put off coming  what with the war  and travel being so difficult these days  they had never come all these years  just sent her money  but never wrote  never came  and expected to find things as they had left them  ah  dear 
2062,why the dressing table drawers were full of things  she pulled them open   handkerchiefs  bits of ribbon 
2063,yes  she could see mrs  ramsay as she came up the drive with the washing 
2064, good evening  mrs  mcnab   she would say 
2065,she had a pleasant way with her 
2066,the girls all liked her 
2067,but  dear  many things had changed since then  she shut the drawer   many families had lost their dearest 
2068,so she was dead  and mr  andrew killed  and miss prue dead too  they said  with her first baby  but everyone had lost some one these years 
2069,prices had gone up shamefully  and did not come down again neither 
2070,she could well remember her in her grey cloak 
2071, good evening  mrs  mcnab   she said  and told cook to keep a plate of milk soup for her   quite thought she wanted it  carrying that heavy basket all the way up from town 
2072,she could see her now  stooping over her flowers  and faint and flickering  like a yellow beam or the circle at the end of a telescope  a lady in a grey cloak  stooping over her flowers  went wandering over the bedroom wall  up the dressing table  across the wash stand  as mrs  mcnab hobbled and ambled  dusting  straightening 
2073,and cook own name now 
2074,mildred 
2075,marian 
2076,  some name like that 
2077,ah  she had forgotten   she did forget things 
2078,fiery  like all red haired women 
2079,many a laugh they had had 
2080,she was always welcome in the kitchen 
2081,she made them laugh  she did 
2082,things were better then than now 
2083,she sighed  there was too much work for one woman 
2084,she wagged her head this side and that 
2085,this had been the nursery 
2086,why  it was all damp in here  the plaster was falling 
2087,whatever did they want to hang a beast own skull there 
2088,gone mouldy too 
2089,and rats in all the attics 
2090,the rain came in 
2091,but they never sent  never came 
2092,some of the locks had gone  so the doors banged 
2093,she did not like to be up here at dusk alone neither 
2094,it was too much for one woman  too much  too much 
2095,she creaked  she moaned 
2096,she banged the door 
2097,she turned the key in the lock  and left the house alone  shut up  locked 
2098,the house was left  the house was deserted 
2099,it was left like a she will on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it 
2100,the long night seemed to have set in  the trifling airs  nibbling  the clammy breaths  fumbling  seemed to have triumphed 
2101,the saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed 
2102,toads had nosed their way in 
2103,idly  aimlessly  the swaying shawl swung to and fro 
2104,a thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder 
2105,the swallows nested in the drawing  roon  the floor was strewn with straw  the plaster fell in shovelfuls  rafters were laid bare  rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots 
2106,tortoise she will butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window pane 
2107,poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias  the lawn waved with long grass  giant artichokes towered among roses  a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages  while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become  on winters  nights  a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole room green in summer 
2108,what power could now prevent the fertility  the insensibility of nature 
2109,mrs  mcnab own dream of a lady  of a child  of a plate of milk soup 
2110,it had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished 
2111,she had locked the door  she had gone 
2112,it was beyond the strength of one woman  she said 
2113,they never sent 
2114,they never wrote 
2115,there were things up there rotting in the drawers   it was a shame to leave them so  she said 
2116,the place was gone to rack and ruin 
2117,only the lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment  sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter  looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow  the rat and the straw 
2118,nothing now withstood them  nothing said no to them 
2119,let the wind blow  let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage 
2120,let the swallow build in the drawing room  and the thistle thrust aside the tiles  and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the arm chairs 
2121,let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries 
2122,for now had come that moment  that hesitation when dawn trembles and night pauses  when if a feather alight in the scale it will be weighed down 
2123,one feather  and the house  sinking  falling  would have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness 
2124,in the ruined room  picnickers would have lit their kettles  lovers sought shelter there  lying on the bare boards  and the shepherd stored his dinner on the bricks  and the tramp slept with his coat round him to ward off the cold 
2125,then the roof would have fallen  briars and hemlocks would have blotted out path  step and window  would have grown  unequally but lustily over the mound  until some trespasser  losing his way  could have told only by a red hot poker among the nettles  or a scrap of china in the hemlock  that here once some one had lived  there had been a house 
2126,if the feather had fallen  if it had tipped the scale downwards  the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of oblivion 
2127,but there was a force working  something not highly conscious  something that leered  something that lurched  something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting 
2128,mrs  mcnab groaned  mrs  bast creaked 
2129,they were old  they were stiff  their legs ached 
2130,they came with their brooms and pails at last  they got to work 
2131,all of a sudden  would mrs  mcnab see that the house was ready  one of the young ladies wrote  would she get this done  would she get that done  all in a hurry 
2132,they might be coming for the summer  had left everything to the last  expected to find things as they had left them 
2133,slowly and painfully  with broom and pail  mopping  scouring  mrs  mcnab  mrs  bast  stayed the corruption and the rot  rescued from the pool of time that was fast closing over them now a basin  now a cupboard  fetched up from oblivion all the waverley novels and a tea set one morning  in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender and a set of steel fire irons 
2134,george  mrs  bast own son  caught the rats  and cut the grass 
2135,they had the builders 
2136,attended with the creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts  the slamming and banging of damp swollen woodwork  some rusty laborious birth seemed to be taking place  as the women  stooping  rising  groaning  singing  slapped and slammed  upstairs now  now down in the cellars 
2137,oh  they said  the work 
2138,they drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes  or in the study  breaking off work at mid day with the smudge on their faces  and their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles 
2139,flopped on chairs  they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and bath  now the more arduous  more partial triumph over long rows of books  black as ravens once  now white stained  breeding pale mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders 
2140,once more  as she felt the tea warm in her  the telescope fitted itself to mrs  mcnab own eyes  and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman  lean as a rake  wagging his head  as she came up with the washing  talking to himself  she supposed  on the lawn 
2141,he never noticed her 
2142,some said he was dead  some said she was dead 
2143,which was it 
2144,mrs  bast did not know for certain either 
2145,the young gentleman was dead 
2146,that she was sure 
2147,she had read his name in the papers 
2148,there was the cook now  mildred  marian  some such name as that   a red  headed woman  quick tempered like all her sort  but kind  too  if you knew the way with her 
2149,many a laugh they had had together 
2150,she saved a plate of soup for maggie  a bite of ham  sometimes  whatever was over 
2151,they lived well in those days 
2152,they had everything they wanted  glibly  jovially  with the tea hot in her  she unwound her ball of memories  sitting in the wicker arm chair by the nursery fender  
2153,there was always plenty doing  people in the house  twenty staying sometimes  and washing up till long past midnight 
2154,mrs  bast  she had never known them  had lived in glasgow at that time  wondered  putting her cup down  whatever they hung that beast own skull there for 
2155,shot in foreign parts no doubt 
2156,it might well be  said mrs  mcnab  wantoning on with her memories  they had friends in eastern countries  gentlemen staying there  ladies in evening dress  she had seen them once through the dining room door all sitting at dinner 
2157,twenty she dared say all in their jewellery  and she asked to stay help wash up  might be till after midnight 
2158,ah  said mrs  bast  they would find it changed 
2159,she leant out of the window 
2160,she watched her son george scything the grass 
2161,they might well ask  what had been done to it 
2162,seeing how old kennedy was supposed to have charge of it  and then his leg got so bad after he fell from the cart  and perhaps then no one for a year  or the better part of one  and then davie macdonald  and seeds might be sent  but who should say if they were ever planted 
2163,they would find it changed 
2164,she watched her son scything 
2165,he was a great one for work   one of those quiet ones 
2166,well they must be getting along with the cupboards  she supposed 
2167,they hauled themselves up 
2168,at last  after days of labour within  of cutting and digging without  dusters were flicked from the windows  the windows were shut to  keys were turned all over the house  the front door was banged  it was finished 
2169,and now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half heard melody  that intermittent music which the ear half catches but let us fall  a bark  a bleat  irregular  intermittent  yet somehow related  the hum of an insect  the tremor of cut grass  disevered yet somehow belonging  the jar of a dorbeetle  the squeak of a wheel  loud  low  but mysteriously related  which the ear strains to bring together and is always on the verge of harmonising  but they are never quite heard  never fully harmonised  and at last  in the evening  one after another the sounds die out  and the harmony falters  and silence falls 
2170,with the sunset sharpness was lost  and like mist rising  quiet rose  quiet spread  the wind settled  loosely the world shook itself down to sleep  darkly here without a light to it  save what came green suffused through leaves  or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window 
2171,lily briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one evening in september 
2172,mr  carmichael came by the same train 
2173,then indeed peace had come 
2174,messages of peace breathed from the sea to the shore 
2175,never to break its sleep any more  to lull it rather more deeply to rest  and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily  dreamt wisely  to confirm   what else was it murmuring   as lily briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room and heard the sea 
2176,through the open window the voice of the beauty of the world came murmuring  too softly to hear exactly what it said   but what mattered if the meaning were plain 
2177,entreating the sleepers  the house was full again  mrs  beckwith was staying there  also mr  carmichael   if they would not actually come down to the beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out 
2178,they would see then night flowing down in purple  his head crowned  his sceptre jewelled  and how in his eyes a child might look 
2179,and if they still faltered  lily was tired out with travelling and slept almost at once  but mr  carmichael read a book by candlelight   if they still said no  that it was vapour  this splendour of his  and the dew had more power than he  and they preferred sleeping  gently then without complaint  or argument  the voice would sing its song 
2180,gently the waves would break  lily heard them in her sleep   tenderly the light fell  it seemed to come through her eyelids  
2181,and it all looked  mr  carmichael thought  shutting his book  falling asleep  much as it used to look 
2182,indeed the voice might resume  as the curtains of dark wrapped themselves over the house  over mrs  beckwith  mr  carmichael  and lily briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on their eyes  why not accept this  be content with this  acquiesce and resign 
2183,the sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the isles soothed them  the night wrapped them  nothing broke their sleep  until  the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin voices in to its whiteness  a cart grinding  a dog somewhere barking  the sun lifted the curtains  broke the veil on their eyes  and lily briscoe stirring in her sleep 
2184,she clutched at her blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff 
2185,her eyes opened wide 
2186,here she was again  she thought  sitting bold upright in bed 
2187,awake 
2188,what does it mean then  what can it all mean 
2189,lily briscoe asked herself  wondering whether  since she had been left alone  it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here 
2190,what does it mean 
2191,  a catchword that was  caught up from some book  fitting her thought loosely  for she could not  this first morning with the ramsays  contract her feelings  could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk 
2192,for really  what did she feel  come back after all these years and mrs  ramsay dead 
2193,nothing  nothing   nothing that she could express at all 
2194,she had come late last night when it was all mysterious  dark 
2195,now she was awake  at her old place at the breakfast table  but alone 
2196,it was very early too  not yet eight 
2197,there was this expedition   they were going to the lighthouse  mr  ramsay  cam  and james 
2198,they should have gone already   they had to catch the tide or something 
2199,and cam was not ready and james was not ready and nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and mr  ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room 
2200, what is the use of going now   he had stormed 
2201,nancy had vanished 
2202,there he was  marching up and down the terrace in a rage 
2203,one seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house 
2204,now nancy burst in  and asked  looking round the room  in a queer half dazed  half desperate way   what does one send to the lighthouse   as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do 
2205,what does one send to the lighthouse indeed 
2206,at any other time lily could have suggested reasonably tea  tobacco  newspapers 
2207,but this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like nancy own   what does one send to the lighthouse 
2208,  opened doors in one own mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking  in a stupefied gape  what does one send 
2209,what does one do 
2210,why is one sitting here  after all 
2211,sitting alone  for nancy went out again  among the clean cups at the long table  she felt cut off from other people  and able only to go on watching  asking  wondering 
2212,the house  the place  the morning  all seemed strangers to her 
2213,she had no attachment here  she felt  no relations with it  anything might happen  and whatever did happen  a step outside  a voice calling   it is not in the cupboard  it is on the landing   some one cried   was a question  as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut  and they floated up here  down there  off  anyhow 
2214,how aimless it was   how chaotic  how unreal it was  she thought  looking at her empty coffee cup 
2215,mrs  ramsay dead  andrew killed  prue dead too   repeat it as she might  it roused no feeling in her 
2216,and we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this  she said  looking out of the window 
2217,it was a beautiful still day 
2218,suddenly mr  ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her  with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating  as if he saw you  for one second  for the first time  for ever  and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him   to escape his demand on her  to put aside a moment longer that imperious need 
2219,and he shook his head at her  and strode on   alone  she heard him say   perished  she heard him say  and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols  wrote themselves all over the grey green walls 
2220,if only she could put them together  she felt  write them out in some sentence  then she would have got at the truth of things 
2221,old mr  carmichael came padding softly in  fetched his coffee  took his cup and made off to sit in the sun 
2222,the extraordinary unreality was frightening  but it was also exciting 
2223,going to the lighthouse 
2224,but what does one send to the lighthouse 
2225,perished 
2226,alone 
2227,the grey green light on the wall opposite 
2228,the empty places 
2229,such were some of the parts  but how bring them together 
2230,she asked 
2231,as if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest mr  ramsay should see her 
2232,she must escape somewhere  be alone somewhere 
2233,suddenly she remembered 
2234,when she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table cloth  which she had looked at in a moment of revelation 
2235,there had been a problem about a foreground of a picture 
2236,move the tree to the middle  she had said 
2237,she had never finished that picture 
2238,she would paint that picture now 
2239,it had been knocking about in her mind all these years 
2240,where were her paints  she wondered 
2241,her paints  yes 
2242,she had left them in the hall last night 
2243,she would start at once 
2244,she got up quickly  before mr  ramsay turned 
2245,she fetched herself a chair 
2246,she pitched her easel with her precise old maidish movements on the edge of the lawn  not too close to mr  carmichael  but close enough for his protection 
2247,yes  it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago 
2248,there was the wall  the hedge  the tree 
2249,the question was of some relation between those masses 
2250,she had borne it in her mind all these years 
2251,it seemed as if the solution had come to her  she knew now what she wanted to do 
2252,but with mr  ramsay bearing down on her  she could do nothing 
2253,every time he approached   he was walking up and down the terrace   ruin approached  chaos approached 
2254,she could not paint 
2255,she stooped  she turned  she took up this rag  she squeezed that tube 
2256,but all she did was to ward him off a moment 
2257,he made it impossible for her to do anything 
2258,for if she gave him the least chance  if he saw her disengaged a moment  looking his way a moment  he would be on her  saying  as he had said last night   you find us much changed  
2259,last night he had got up and stopped before her  and said that 
2260,dumb and staring though they had all sat  the six children whom they used to call after the kings and queens of england   the red  the fair  the wicked  the ruthless   she felt how they raged under it 
2261,kind old mrs  beckwith said something sensible 
2262,but it was a house full of unrelated passions   she had felt that all the evening 
2263,and on top of this chaos mr  ramsay got up  pressed her hand  and said   you will find us much changed  and none of them had moved or had spoken  but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it 
2264,only james  certainly the sullen  scowled at the lamp  and cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger 
2265,then he reminded them that they were going to the lighthouse tomorrow 
2266,they must be ready  in the hall  on the stroke of half past seven 
2267,then  with his hand on the door  he stopped  he turned upon them 
2268,did they not want to go 
2269,he demanded 
2270,had they dared say no  he had some reason for wanting it  he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair 
2271,such a gift he had for gesture 
2272,he looked like a king in exile 
2273,doggedly james said yes 
2274,cam stumbled more wretchedly 
2275,yes  oh  yes  they would both be ready  they said 
2276,and it struck her  this was tragedy   not palls  dust  and the shroud  but children coerced  their spirits subdued 
2277,james was sixteen  cam  seventeen  perhaps 
2278,she had looked round for some one who was not there  for mrs  ramsay  presumably 
2279,but there was only kind mrs  beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp 
2280,then  being tired  her mind still rising and falling with the sea  the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her  the candles wavering in her eyes  she had lost herself and gone under 
2281,it was a wonderful night  starlit  the waves sounded as they went upstairs  the moon surprised them  enormous  pale  as they passed the staircase window 
2282,she had slept at once 
2283,she set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel  as a barrier  frail  but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off mr  ramsay and his exactingness 
2284,she did her best to look  when his back was turned  at her picture  that line there  that mass there 
2285,but it was out of the question 
2286,let him be fifty feet away  let him not even speak to you  let him not even see you  he permeated  he prevailed  he imposed himself 
2287,he changed everything 
2288,she could not see the colour  she could not see the lines  even with his back turned to her  she could only think  but he will be down on me in a moment  demanding   something she felt she could not give him 
2289,she rejected one brush  she chose another 
2290,when would those children come 
2291,when would they all be off 
2292,she fidgeted 
2293,that man  she thought  her anger rising in her  never gave  that man took 
2294,she  on the other hand  would be forced to give 
2295,mrs  ramsay had given 
2296,giving  giving  giving  she had died   and had left all this 
2297,really  she was angry with mrs  ramsay 
2298,with the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge  the step  the wall 
2299,it was all mrs  ramsay own doing 
2300,she was dead 
2301,here was lily  at forty four  wasting her time  unable to do a thing  standing there  playing at painting  playing at the one thing one did not play at  and it was all mrs  ramsay own fault 
2302,she was dead 
2303,the step where she used to sit was empty 
2304,she was dead 
2305,but why repeat this over and over again 
2306,why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got 
2307,there was a kind of blasphemy in it 
2308,it was all dry  all withered  all spent 
2309,they ought not to have asked her  she ought not to have come 
2310,one cannot waste one own time at forty  four  she thought 
2311,she hated playing at painting 
2312,a brush  the one dependable thing in a world of strife  ruin  chaos   that one should not play with  knowingly even  she detested it 
2313,but he made her 
2314,you shall not touch your canvas  he seemed to say  bearing down on her  till you have given me what i want of you 
2315,here he was  close upon her again  greedy  distraught 
2316,well  thought lily in despair  letting her right hand fall at her side  it would be simpler then to have it over 
2317,surely  she could imitate from recollection the glow  the rhapsody  the self surrender  she had seen on so many women own faces  on mrs  ramsay own  for instance  when on some occasion like this they blazed up   she could remember the look on mrs  ramsay own face   into a rapture of sympathy  of delight in the reward they had  which  though the reason of it escaped her  evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable 
2318,here he was  stopped by her side 
2319,she would give him what she could 
2320,she seemed to have shrivelled slightly  he thought 
2321,she looked a little skimpy  wispy  but not unattractive 
2322,he liked her 
2323,there had been some talk of her marrying william bankes once  but nothing had come of it 
2324,his wife had been fond of her 
2325,he had been a little out of temper too at breakfast 
2326,and then  and then   this was one of those moments when an enormous need urged him  without being conscious what it was  to approach any woman  to force them  he did not care how  his need was so great  to give him what he wanted  sympathy 
2327,was anybody looking after her 
2328,he said 
2329,had she everything she wanted 
2330, oh  thanks  everything   said lily briscoe nervously 
2331,no  she could not do it 
2332,she ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of sympathetic expansion  the pressure on her was tremendous 
2333,but she remained stuck 
2334,there was an awful pause 
2335,they both looked at the sea 
2336,why  thought mr  ramsay  should she look at the sea when i am here 
2337,she hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the lighthouse  she said 
2338,the lighthouse 
2339,the lighthouse 
2340,what is that got to do with it 
2341,he thought impatiently 
2342,instantly  with the force of some primeval gust  for really he could not restrain himself any longer   there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something  said something   all except myself  thought lily  girding at herself bitterly  who am not a woman  but a peevish  ill tempered  dried up old maid  presumably 
2343,mr  ramsay sighed to the full 
2344,he waited 
2345,was she not going to say anything 
2346,did she not see what he wanted from her 
2347,then he said he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the lighthouse 
2348,his wife used to send the men things 
2349,there was a poor boy with a tuberculous hip  the lightkeeper own son 
2350,he sighed profoundly 
2351,he sighed significantly 
2352,all lily wished was that this enormous flood of grief  this insatiable hunger for sympathy  this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely  and even so he had sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever  should leave her  should be diverted  she kept looking at the house  hoping for an interruption  before it swept her down in its flow 
2353, such expeditions   said mr  ramsay  scraping the ground with his toe   are very painful  
2354,still lily said nothing 
2355, she is a stock  she is a stone  he said to himself    they are very exhausting   he said  looking  with a sickly look that nauseated her  he was acting  she felt  this great man was dramatising himself   at his beautiful hands 
2356,it was horrible  it was indecent 
2357,would they never come  she asked  for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow  support these heavy draperies of grief  he had assumed a pose of extreme decreptitude  he even tottered a little as he stood there  a moment longer 
2358,still she could say nothing  the whole horizon seemed swept bare of objects to talk about  could only feel  amazedly  as mr  ramsay stood there  how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and discolour it  and cast over the rubicund  drowsy  entirely contented figure of mr  carmichael  reading a french novel on a deck chair  a veil of crape  as if such an existence  flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe  were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all 
2359,look at him  he seemed to be saying  look at me  and indeed  all the time he was feeling  think of me  think of me 
2360,ah  could that bulk only be wafted alongside of them  lily wished  had she only pitched her easel a yard or two closer to him  a man  any man  would staunch this effusion  would stop these lamentations 
2361,a woman  she had provoked this horror  a woman  she should have known how to deal with it 
2362,it was immensely to her discredit  sexually  to stand there dumb 
2363,one said   what did one say 
2364,  oh  mr  ramsay 
2365,dear mr  ramsay 
2366,that was what that kind old lady who sketched  mrs  beckwith  would have said instantly  and rightly 
2367,but  no 
2368,they stood there  isolated from the rest of the world 
2369,his immense self pity  his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at ther feet  and all she did  miserable sinner that she was  was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles  lest she should get wet 
2370,in complete silence she stood there  grasping her paint brush 
2371,heaven could never be sufficiently praised 
2372,she heard sounds in the house 
2373,james and cam must be coming 
2374,but mr  ramsay  as if he knew that his time ran short  exerted upon her solitary figure the immense pressure of his concentrated woe  his age  his frailty  his desolation  when suddenly  tossing his head impatiently  in his annoyance   for after all  what woman could resist him 
2375,  he noticed that his boot laces were untied 
2376,remarkable boots they were too  lily thought  looking down at them  sculptured  colossal  like everything that mr  ramsay wore  from his frayed tie to his half buttoned waistcoat  his own indisputably 
2377,she could see them walking to his room of their own accord  expressive in his absence of pathos  surliness  ill temper  charm 
2378, what beautiful boots   she exclaimed 
2379,she was ashamed of herself 
2380,to praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul  when he had shown her his bleeding hands  his lacerated heart  and asked her to pity them  then to say  cheerfully   ah  but what beautiful boots you wear   deserved  she knew  and she looked up expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill temper complete annihilation 
2381,instead  mr  ramsay smiled 
2382,his pall  his draperies  his infirmities fell from him 
2383,ah  yes  he said  holding his foot up for her to look at  they were first rate boots 
2384,there was only one man in england who could make boots like that 
2385,boots are among the chief curses of mankind  he said 
2386, bootmakers make it their business   he exclaimed   to cripple and torture the human foot  
2387,they are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind 
2388,it had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made 
2389,he would have her observe  he lifted his right foot and then his left  that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before 
2390,they were made of the finest leather in the world  also 
2391,most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard 
2392,he looked complacently at his foot  still held in the air 
2393,they had reached  she felt  a sunny island where peace dwelt  sanity reigned and the sun for ever shone  the blessed island of good boots 
2394,her heart warmed to him 
2395, now let me see if you can tie a knot   he said 
2396,he poohpoohed her feeble system 
2397,he showed her his own invention 
2398,once you tied it  it never came undone 
2399,three times he knotted her shoe  three times he unknotted it 
2400,why  at this completely inappropriate moment  when he was stooping over her shoe  should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that  as she stooped too  the blood rushed to her face  and  thinking of her callousness  she had called him a play actor  she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears 
2401,thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos 
2402,he tied knots 
2403,he bought boots 
2404,there was no helping mr  ramsay on the journey he was going 
2405,but now just as she wished to say something  could have said something  perhaps  here they were   cam and james 
2406,they appeared on the terrace 
2407,they came  lagging  side by side  a serious  melancholy couple 
2408,but why was it like that that they came 
2409,she could not help feeling annoyed with them  they might have come more cheerfully  they might have given him what  now that they were off  she would not have the chance of giving him 
2410,for she felt a sudden emptiness  a frustration 
2411,her feeling had come too late  there it was ready  but he no longer needed it 
2412,he had become a very distinguished  elderly man  who had no need of her whatsoever 
2413,she felt snubbed 
2414,he slung a knapsack round his shoulders 
2415,he shared out the parcels   there were a number of them  ill tied in brown paper 
2416,he sent cam for a cloak 
2417,he had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition 
2418,then  wheeling about  he led the way with his firm military tread  in those wonderful boots  carrying brown paper parcels  down the path  his children following him 
2419,they looked  she thought  as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise  and they went to it  still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father own wake  obediently  but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence 
2420,so they passed the edge of the lawn  and it seemed to lily that she watched a procession go  drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it  faltering and flagging as it was  a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her 
2421,politely  but very distantly  mr  ramsay raised his hand and saluted her as they passed 
2422,but what a face  she thought  immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression 
2423,what had made it like that 
2424,thinking  night after night  she supposed   about the reality of kitchen tables  she added  remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what mr  ramsay did think about andrew had given her 
2425, he had been killed by the splinter of a she will instantly  she bethought her  
2426,the kitchen table was something visionary  austere  something bare  hard  not ornamental 
2427,there was no colour to it  it was all edges and angles  it was uncompromisingly plain 
2428,but mr  ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it  never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded  until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her 
2429,then  she recalled  standing where he had left her  holding her brush   worries had fretted it   not so nobly 
2430,he must have had his doubts about that table  she supposed  whether the table was a real table  whether it was worth the time he gave to it  whether he was able after all to find it 
2431,he had had doubts  she felt  or he would have asked less of people 
2432,that was what they talked about late at night sometimes  she suspected  and then next day mrs  ramsay looked tired  and lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing 
2433,but now he had nobody to talk to about that table  or his boots  or his knots  and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour  and his face had that touch of desperation  of exaggeration in it which alarmed her  and made her pull her skirts about her 
2434,and then  she recalled  there was that sudden revivification  that sudden flare  when she praised his boots   that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things  which too passed and changed  for he was always changing  and hid nothing  into that other final phase which was new to her and had  she owned  made herself ashamed of her own irritability  when it seemed as if he had she would worries and ambitions  and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise  had entered some other region  was drawn on  as if by curiosity  in dumb colloquy  whether with himself or another  at the head of that little procession out of one own range 
2435,an extraordinary face 
2436,the gate banged 
2437,so they are gone  she thought  sighing with relief and disappointment 
2438,her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her  like a bramble sprung across her face 
2439,she felt curiously divided  as if one part of her were drawn out there   it was a still day  hazy  the lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance  the other had fixed itself doggedly  solidly  here on the lawn 
2440,she saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her 
2441,it seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation  this folly and waste of emotion  it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a peace  as her disorderly sensations  he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing  trooped off the field  and then  emptiness 
2442,she looked blankly at the canvas  with its uncompromising white stare  from the canvas to the garden 
2443,there was something  she stood screwing up her little chinese eyes in her small puckered face   something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across  slicing down  and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns  which had stayed in her mind  which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time  involuntarily  as she walked along the brompton road  as she brushed her hair  she found herself painting that picture  passing her eye over it  and untying the knot in imagination 
2444,but there was all the difference in the world between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush and making the first mark 
2445,she had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at mr  ramsay own presence  and her easel  rammed into the earth so nervously  was at the wrong angle 
2446,and now that she had ut that right  and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person  had such and such relations to people  she took her hand and raised her brush 
2447,for a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air 
2448,where to begin 
2449,  that was the question at what point to make the first mark 
2450,one line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks  to frequent and irrevocable decisions 
2451,all that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex  as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top  but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs  and foaming crests 
2452,still the risk must be run  the mark made 
2453,with a curious physical sensation  as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back  she made her first quick decisive stroke 
2454,the brush descended 
2455,it flickered brown over the white canvas  it left a running mark 
2456,a second time she did it   a third time 
2457,and so pausing and so flickering  she attained a dancing rhythmical movement  as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another  and all were related  and so  lightly and swiftly pausing  striking  she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed   she felt it looming out at her  a space 
2458,down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her 
2459,for what could be more formidable than that space 
2460,here she was again  she thought  stepping back to look at it  drawn out of gossip  out of living  out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers   this other thing  this truth  this reality  which suddenly laid hands on her  emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention 
2461,she was half unwilling  half reluctant 
2462,why always be drawn out and haled away 
2463,why not left in peace  to talk to mr  carmichael on the lawn 
2464,it was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow 
2465,other worshipful objects were content with worship  men  women  god  all let one kneel prostrate  but this form  were it only the shape of a white lamp shade looming on a wicker table  roused one to perpetual combat  challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted 
2466,always  it was in her nature  or in her sex  she did not know which  before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul  a soul reft of body  hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt 
2467,why then did she do it 
2468,she looked at the canvas  lightly scored with running lines 
2469,it would be hung in the servants  bedrooms 
2470,it would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa 
2471,what was the good of doing it then  and she heard some voice saying she could not paint  saying she could not create  as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind  so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them 
2472,cannot paint  cannot write  she murmured monotonously  anxiously considering what her plan of attack should be 
2473,for the mass loomed before her  it protruded  she felt it pressing on her eyeballs 
2474,then  as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted  she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers  moving her brush hither and thither  but it was now heavier and went slower  as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her  she kept looking at the hedge  at the canvas  by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current 
2475,certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things 
2476,and as she lost consciousness of outer things  and her name and her personality and her appearance  and whether mr  carmichael was there or not  her mind kept throwing up from its depths  scenes  and names  and sayings  and memories and ideas  like a fountain spurting over that glaring  hideously difficult white space  while she modelled it with greens and blues 
2477,charles tansley used to say that  she remembered  women cannot paint  cannot write 
2478,coming up behind her  he had stood close beside her  a thing she hated  as she painted her on this very spot 
2479, shag tobacco   he said   fivepence an ounce   parading his poverty  his principles 
2480, but the war had drawn the sting of her femininity  poor devils  one thought  poor devils  of both sexes  
2481,he was always carrying a book about under his arm   a purple book 
2482,he  worked  
2483,he sat  she remembered  working in a blaze of sun 
2484,at dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view 
2485,but after all  she reflected  there was the scene on the beach 
2486,one must remember that 
2487,it was a windy morning 
2488,they had all gone down to the beach 
2489,mrs  ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock 
2490,she wrote and wrote 
2491, oh   she said  looking up at something floating in the sea   is it a lobster pot  is it an upturned boat  
2492,she was so short sighted that she could not see  and then charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be 
2493,he began playing ducks and drakes 
2494,they chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves 
2495,every now and then mrs  ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them 
2496,what they said she could not remember  but only she and charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and mrs  ramsay watching them 
2497,she was highly conscious of that 
2498,mrs  ramsay  she thought  stepping back and screwing up her eyes 
2499, it must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with james  there must have been a shadow  
2500,when she thought of herself and charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach  it seemed to depend somehow upon mrs  ramsay sitting under the rock  with a pad on her knee  writing letters 
2501, she wrote innumerable letters  and sometimes the wind took them and she and charles just saved a page from the sea  
2502,but what a power was in the human soul  she thought 
2503,that woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity  made these angers  irritations fall off like old rags  she brought together this and that and then this  and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite  she and charles squabbling  sparring  had been silly and spiteful  something   this scene on the beach for example  this moment of friendship and liking   which survived  after all these years complete  so that she dipped into it to re fashion her memory of him  and there it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art 
2504, like a work of art   she repeated  looking from her canvas to the drawing room steps and back again 
2505,she must rest for a moment 
2506,and  resting  looking from one to the other vaguely  the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually  the vast  the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these  when she released faculties that had been on the strain  stood over her  paused over her  darkened over her 
2507,what is the meaning of life 
2508,that was all   a simple question  one that tended to close in on one with years 
2509,the great revelation had never come 
2510,the great revelation perhaps never did come 
2511,instead there were little daily miracles  illuminations  matches struck unexpectedly in the dark  here was one 
2512,this  that  and the other  herself and charles tansley and the breaking wave  mrs  ramsay bringing them together  mrs  ramsay saying   life stand still here   mrs  ramsay making of the moment something permanent  as in another sphere lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent    this was of the nature of a revelation 
2513,in the midst of chaos there was shape  this eternal passing and flowing  she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking  was struck into stability 
2514,life stand still here  mrs  ramsay said 
2515, mrs  ramsay  mrs  ramsay   she repeated 
2516,she owed it all to her 
2517,all was silence 
2518,nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house 
2519,she looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves 
2520,the faint thought she was thinking of mrs  ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house  this smoke  this fine early morning air 
2521,faint and unreal  it was amazingly pure and exciting 
2522,she hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house  but that she might be left alone to go on thinking  to go on painting 
2523,she turned to her canvas 
2524,but impelled by some curiosity  driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged  she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether  down there on the beach  she could see that little company setting sail 
2525,down there among the little boats which floated  some with their sails furled  some slowly  for it was very calm moving away  there was one rather apart from the others 
2526,the sail was even now being hoisted 
2527,she decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat mr  ramsay was sitting with cam and james 
2528,now they had got the sail up  now after a little flagging and silence  she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea 
2529,the sails flapped over their heads 
2530,the water chuckled and slapped the sides of the boat  which drowsed motionless in the sun 
2531,now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them  but the ripple ran over them and ceased 
2532,the boat made no motion at all 
2533,mr  ramsay sat in the middle of the boat 
2534,he would be impatient in a moment  james thought  and cam thought  looking at her father  who sat in the middle of the boat between them  james steered  cam sat alone in the bow  with his legs tightly curled 
2535,he hated hanging about 
2536,sure enough  after fidgeting a second or two  he said something sharp to macalister own boy  who got out his oars and began to row 
2537,but their father  they knew  would never be content until they were flying along 
2538,he would keep looking for a breeze  fidgeting  saying things under his breath  which macalister and and macalister own boy would overhear  and they would both be made horribly uncomfortable 
2539,he had made them come 
2540,he had forced them to come 
2541,in their anger they hoped that the breeze would never rise  that he might be thwarted in every possible way  since he had forced them to come against their wills 
2542,all the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together  though he bade them  walk up  walk up   without speaking 
2543,their heads were bent down  their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale 
2544,speak to him they could not 
2545,they must come  they must follow 
2546,they must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels 
2547,but they vowed  in silence  as they walked  to stand by each other and carry out the great compact   to resist tyranny to the death 
2548,so there they would sit  one at one end of the boat  one at the other  in silence 
2549,they would say nothing  only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs twisted  frowning and fidgeting  and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to himself  and waiting impatiently for a breeze 
2550,and they hoped it would be calm 
2551,they hoped he would be thwarted 
2552,they hoped the whole expedition would fail  and they would have to put back  with their parcels  to the beach 
2553,but now  when macalister own boy had rowed a little way out  the sails slowly swung round  the boat quickened itself  flattened itself  and shot off 
2554,instantly  as if some great strain had been relieved  mr  ramsay uncurled his legs  took out his tobacco pouch  handed it with a little grunt to macalister  and felt  they knew  for all they suffered  perfectly content 
2555,now they would sail on for hours like this  and mr  ramsay would ask old macalister a question   about the great storm last winter probably   and old macalister would answer it  and they would puff their pipes together  and macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers  tying or untying some knot  and the boy would fish  and never say a word to any one 
2556,james would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail 
2557,for if he forgot  then the sail puckered and shivered  and the boat slackened  and mr  ramsay would say sharply   look out  look out   and old macalister would turn slowly on his seat 
2558,so they heard mr  ramsay asking some question about the great storm at christmas 
2559, she comes driving round the point   old macalister said  describing the great storm last christmas  when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter  and he had seen  one there  one there  one there   he pointed slowly round the bay  mr  ramsay followed him  turning his head  
2560,he had seen four men clinging to the mast 
2561,then she was gone 
2562, and at last we shoved her off   he went on  but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there  sitting at opposite ends of the boat  united by their compact to fight tyranny to the death  
2563,at last they had shoved her off  they had launched the lifeboat  and they had got her out past the point   macalister told the story  and though they only caught a word here and there  they were conscious all the time of their father   how he leant forward  how he brought his voice into tune with macalister own voice  how  puffing at his pipe  and looking there and there where macalister pointed  he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there 
2564,he liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night  pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind  he liked men to work like that  and women to keep house  and sit beside sleeping children indoors  while men were drowned  out there in a storm 
2565,so james could tell  so cam could tell  they looked at him  they looked at each other   from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice  and the little tinge of scottish accent which came into his voice  making him seem like a peasant himself  as he questioned macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm 
2566,three had sunk 
2567,he looked proudly where macalister pointed  and cam thought  feeling proud of him without knowing quite why  had he been there he would have launched the lifeboat  he would have reached the wreck  cam thought 
2568,he was so brave  he was so adventurous  cam thought 
2569,but she remembered 
2570,there was the compact  to resist tyranny to the death 
2571,their grievance weighed them down 
2572,they had been forced  they had been bidden 
2573,he had borne them down once more with his gloom and his authority  making them do his bidding  on this fine morning  come  because he wished it  carrying these parcels  to the lighthouse  take part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of dead people  which they hated  so that they lagged after him  all the pleasure of the day was spoilt 
2574,yes  the breeze was freshening 
2575,the boat was leaning  the water was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades  in bubbles  in cataracts 
2576,cam looked down into the foam  into the sea with all its treasure in it  and its speed hypnotised her  and the tie between her and james sagged a little 
2577,it slackened a little 
2578,she began to think  how fast it goes 
2579,where are we going 
2580,and the movement hypnotised her  while james  with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon  steered grimly 
2581,but he began to think as he steered that he might escape  he might be quit of it all 
2582,they might land somewhere  and be free then 
2583,both of them  looking at each other for a moment  had a sense of escape and exaltation  what with the speed and the change 
2584,but the breeze bred in mr  ramsay too the same excitement  and  as old macalister turned to fling his line overboard  he cried out aloud 
2585, we perished   and then again   each alone  
2586,and then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness  pulled himself up  and waved his hand towards the shore 
2587, see the little house   he said pointing  wishing cam to look 
2588,she raised herself reluctantly and looked 
2589,but which was it 
2590,she could no longer make out  there on the hillside  which was their house 
2591,all looked distant and peaceful and strange 
2592,the shore seemed refined  far away  unreal 
2593,already the little distance they had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look  the composed look  of something receding in which one has no longer any part 
2594,which was their house 
2595,she could not see it 
2596, but i beneath a rougher sea   mr  ramsay murmured 
2597,he had found the house and so seeing it  he had also seen himself there  he had seen himself walking on the terrace  alone 
2598,he was walking up and down between the urns  and he seemed to himself very old and bowed 
2599,sitting in the boat  he bowed  he crouched himself  acting instantly his part   the part of a desolate man  widowed  bereft  and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him  staged for himself as he sat in the boat  a little drama  which required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow  he raised his hands and looked at the thinness of them  to confirm his dream  and then there was given him in abundance women own sympathy  and he imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him  and so getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure women own sympathy was to him  he sighed and said gently and mournfully 
2600,but i beneath a rougher sea was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he 
2601,so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all 
2602,cam half started on her seat 
2603,it shocked her   it outraged her 
2604,the movement roused her father  and he shuddered  and broke off  exclaiming   look  look   so urgently that james also turned his head to look over his shoulder at the island 
2605,they all looked 
2606,they looked at the island 
2607,but cam could see nothing 
2608,she was thinking how all those paths and the lawn  thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there  were gone  were rubbed out  were past  were unreal  and now this was real  the boat and the sail with its patch  macalister with his earrings  the noise of the waves   all this was real 
2609,thinking this  she was murmuring to herself   we perished  each alone   for her father own words broke and broke again in her mind  when her father  seeing her gazing so vaguely  began to tease her 
2610,did not she know the points of the compass 
2611,he asked 
2612,did not she know the north from the south 
2613,did she really think they lived right out there 
2614,and he pointed again  and showed her where their house was  there  by those trees 
2615,he wished she would try to be more accurate  he said   tell me   which is east  which is west   he said  half laughing at her  half scolding her  for he could not understand the state of mind of any one  not absolutely imbecile  who did not know the points of the compass 
2616,yet she did not know 
2617,and seeing her gazing  with her vague  now rather frightened  eyes fixed where no house was mr  ramsay forgot his dream  how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace  how the arms were stretched out to him 
2618,he thought  women are always like that  the vagueness of their minds is hopeless  it was a thing he had never been able to understand  but so it was 
2619,it had been so with her   his wife 
2620,they could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds 
2621,but he had been wrong to be angry with her  moreover  did he not rather like this vagueness in women 
2622,it was part of their extraordinary charm 
2623,i will make her smile at me  he thought 
2624,she looks frightened 
2625,she was so silent 
2626,he clutched his fingers  and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves 
2627,he would make her smile at him 
2628,he would find some simple easy thing to say to her 
2629,but what 
2630,for  wrapped up in his work as he was  he forgot the sort of thing one said 
2631,there was a puppy 
2632,they had a puppy 
2633,who was looking after the puppy today 
2634,he asked 
2635,yes  thought james pitilessly  seeing his sister own head against the sail  now she will give way 
2636,i shall be left to fight the tyrant alone 
2637,the compact would be left to him to carry out 
2638,cam would never resist tyranny to the death  he thought grimly  watching her face  sad  sulky  yielding 
2639,and as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding hills is gloom and sorrow  and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded  the darkened  either in pity  or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay  so cam now felt herself overcast  as she sat there among calm  resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy  how to resist his entreaty   forgive me  care for me  while james the lawgiver  with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee  his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her   said  resist him 
2640,fight him 
2641,he said so rightly  justly 
2642,for they must fight tyranny to the death  she thought 
2643,of all human qualities she reverenced justice most 
2644,her brother was most god like  her father most suppliant 
2645,and to which did she yield  she thought  sitting between them  gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her  and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there 
2646, jasper   she said sullenly 
2647,he would look after the puppy 
2648,and what was she going to call him 
2649,her father persisted 
2650,he had had a dog when he was a little boy  called frisk 
2651,she will give way  james thought  as he watched a look come upon her face  a look he remembered 
2652,they look down he thought  at their knitting or something 
2653,then suddenly they look up 
2654,there was a flash of blue  he remembered  and then somebody sitting with him laughed  surrendered  and he was very angry 
2655,it must have been his mother  he thought  sitting on a low chair  with his father standing over her 
2656,he began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down  leaf upon leaf  fold upon fold softly  incessantly upon his brain  among scents  sounds  voices  harsh  hollow  sweet  and lights passing  and brooms tapping  and the wash and hush of the sea  how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead  upright  over them 
2657,meanwhile  he noticed  cam dabbled her fingers in the water  and stared at the shore and said nothing 
2658,no  she will not give way  he thought  she is different  he thought 
2659,well  if cam would not answer him  he would not bother her mr  ramsay decided  feeling in his pocket for a book 
2660,but she would answer him  she wished  passionately  to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say  oh  yes  frisk 
2661,I will call him frisk 
2662,she wanted even to say  was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone 
2663,but try as she might  she could think of nothing to say like that  fierce and loyal to the compact  yet passing on to her father  unsuspected by james  a private token of the love she felt for him 
2664,for she thought  dabbling her hand  and now macalister own boy had caught a mackerel  and it lay kicking on the floor  with blood on its gills  for she thought  looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail  or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon  you are not exposed to it  to this pressure and division of feeling  this extraordinary temptation 
2665,her father was feeling in his pockets  in another second  he would have found his book 
2666,for no one attracted her more  his hands were beautiful  and his feet  and his voice  and his words  and his haste  and his temper  and his oddity  and his passion  and his saying straight out before every one  we perish  each alone  and his remoteness 
2667, he had opened his book  
2668,but what remained intolerable  she thought  sitting upright  and watching macalister own boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish  was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms  so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his  some insolence   do this    do that   his dominance  his  submit to me  
2669,so she said nothing  but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore  wrapped in its mantle of peace  as if the people there had fallen asleep  she thought  were free like smoke  were free to come and go like ghosts 
2670,they have no suffering there  she thought 
2671,yes  that is their boat  lily briscoe decided  standing on the edge of the lawn 
2672,it was the boat with greyish brown sails  which she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay 
2673,there he sits  she thought  and the children are quite silent still 
2674,and she could not reach him either 
2675,the sympathy she had not given him weighed her down 
2676,it made it difficult for her to paint 
2677,she had always found him difficult 
2678,she never had been able to praise him to his face  she remembered 
2679,and that reduced their relationship to something neutral  without that element of sex in it which made his manner to minta so gallant  almost gay 
2680,he would pick a flower for her  lend her his books 
2681,but could he believe that minta read them 
2682,she dragged them about the garden  sticking in leaves to mark the place 
2683, d you remember  mr  carmichael   she was inclined to ask  looking at the old man 
2684,but he had pulled his hat half over his forehead  he was asleep  or he was dreaming  or he was lying there catching words  she supposed 
2685, d you remember   she felt inclined to ask him as she passed him  thinking again of mrs  ramsay on the beach  the cask bobbing up and down  and the pages flying 
2686,why  after all these years had that survived  ringed round  lit up  visible to the last detail  with all before it blank and all after it blank  for miles and miles 
2687, is it a boat  is it a cork   she would say  lily repeated  turning back  reluctantly again  to her canvas 
2688,heaven be praised for it  the problem of space remained  she thought  taking up her brush again 
2689,it glared at her 
2690,the whole mass of the picture was poised upon that weight 
2691,beautiful and bright it should be on the surface  feathery and evanescent  one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly own wing  but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron 
2692,it was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath  and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses 
2693,and she began to lay on a red  a grey  and she began to model her way into the hollow there 
2694,at the same time  she seemed to be sitting beside mrs  ramsay on the beach 
2695, is it a boat  is it a cask  
2696,mrs  ramsay said 
2697,and she began hunting round for her spectacles 
2698,and she sat  having found them  silent  looking out to sea 
2699,and lily  painting steadily  felt as if a door had opened  and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high cathedral like place  very dark  very solemn 
2700,shouts came from a world far away 
2701,steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon 
2702,charles threw stones and sent them skipping 
2703,mrs  ramsay sat silent 
2704,she was glad  lily thought  to rest in silence  uncommunicative  to rest in the extreme obscurity of human relationships 
2705,who knows what we are  what we feel 
2706,who knows even at the moment of intimacy  this is knowledge 
2707,are not things spoilt then  mrs  ramsay may have asked  it seemed to have happened so often  this silence by her side  by saying them 
2708,are not we more expressive thus 
2709,the moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile 
2710,she rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up  by way of burying in it the perfection of the moment 
2711,it was like a drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of the past 
2712,lily stepped back to get her canvas   so   into perspective 
2713,it was an odd road to be walking  this of painting 
2714,out and out one went  further  until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank  perfectly alone  over the sea 
2715,and as she dipped into the blue paint  she dipped too into the past there 
2716,now mrs  ramsay got up  she remembered 
2717,it was time to go back to the house   time for luncheon 
2718,and they all walked up from the beach together  she walking behind with william bankes  and there was minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking 
2719,how that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them 
2720,how william bankes deplored it  without  so far as she could remember  saying anything about it 
2721,it meant to him the annihilation of womanhood  and dirt and disorder  and servants leaving and beds not made at mid day   all the things he most abhorred 
2722,he had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did now   holding his hand in front of him 
2723,and minta walked on ahead  and presumably paul met her and she went off with paul in the garden 
2724,the rayleys  thought lily briscoe  squeezing her tube of green paint 
2725,she collected her impressions of the rayleys 
2726,their lives appeared to her in a series of scenes  one  on the staircase at dawn 
2727,paul had come in and gone to bed early  minta was late 
2728,there was minta  wreathed  tinted  garish on the stairs about three of the clock in the morning 
2729,paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars 
2730,minta was eating a sandwich  standing half way up by a window  in the cadaverous early morning light  and the carpet had a hole in it 
2731,but what did they say 
2732,lily asked herself  as if by looking she could hear them 
2733,minta went on eating her sandwich  annoyingly  while he spoke something violent  abusing her  in a mutter so as not to wake the children  the two little boys 
2734,he was withered  drawn  she flamboyant  careless 
2735,for things had worked loose after the first year or so  the marriage had turned out rather badly 
2736,and this  lily thought  taking the green paint on her brush  this making up scenes about them  is what we call  knowing  people   thinking  of them   being fond  of them 
2737,not a word of it was true  she had made it up  but it was what she knew them by all the same 
2738,she went on tunnelling her way into her picture  into the past 
2739,another time  paul said he  played chess in coffee houses  
2740,she had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too 
2741,she remembered how  as he said it  she thought how he rang up the servant  and she said   mrs  rayley own out  sir   and he decided that he would not come home either 
2742,she saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats  and the waitresses got to know you  and he played chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at surbiton  but that was all paul knew about him 
2743,and then minta was out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs  when he got the poker in case of burglars  no doubt to frighten her too  and spoke so bitterly  saying she had ruined his life 
2744,at any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near rickmansworth  things were horribly strained 
2745,paul took her down the garden to look at the belgian hares which he bred  and minta followed them  singing  and put her bare arm on his shoulder  lest he should tell her anything 
2746,minta was bored by hares  lily thought 
2747,but minta never gave herself away 
2748,she never said things like that about playing chess in coffee  houses 
2749,she was far too conscious  far too wary 
2750,but to go on with their story   they had got through the dangerous stage by now 
2751,she had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and minta had to hand him his tools 
2752,he sat on the road mending the car  and it was the way she gave him the tools   business like  straightforward  friendly   that proved it was all right now 
2753,they were  in love  no longer  no  he had taken up with another woman  a serious woman  with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand  minta had described her gratefully  almost admiringly   who went to meetings and shared paul own views  they had got more and more pronounced  about the taxation of land values and a capital levy 
2754,far from breaking up the marriage  that alliance had righted it 
2755,they were excellent friends  obviously  as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools 
2756,so that was the story of the rayleys  lily thought 
2757,she imagined herself telling it to mrs  ramsay  who would be full of curiosity to know what had become of the rayleys 
2758,she would feel a little triumphant  telling mrs  ramsay that the marriage had not been a success 
2759,but the dead  thought lily  encountering some obstacle in her design which made her pause and ponder  stepping back a foot or so  oh  the dead  she murmured  one pitied them  one brushed them aside  one had even a little contempt for them 
2760,they are at our mercy 
2761,mrs  ramsay has faded and gone  she thought 
2762,we can over ride her wishes  improve away her limited  old fashioned ideas 
2763,she recedes further and further from us 
2764,mockingly she seemed to see her there at the end of the corridor of years saying  of all incongruous things   marry  marry    sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to cheep in the garden outside  
2765,and one would have to say to her  it has all gone against your wishes 
2766,they are happy like that  I am happy like this 
2767,life has changed completely 
2768,at that all her being  even her beauty  became for a moment  dusty and out of date 
2769,for a moment lily  standing there  with the sun hot on her back  summing up the rayleys  triumphed over mrs  ramsay  who would never know how paul went to coffee houses and had a mistress  how he sat on the ground and minta handed him his tools  how she stood here painting  had never married  not even william bankes 
2770,mrs  ramsay had planned it 
2771,perhaps  had she lived  she would have compelled it 
2772,already that summer he was  the kindest of men  
2773,he was  the first scientist of his age  my husband says  
2774,he was also  poor william   it makes me so unhappy  when i go to see him  to find nothing nice in his house   no one to arrange the flowers  
2775,so they were sent for walks together  and she was told  with that faint touch of irony that made mrs  ramsay slip through one own fingers  that she had a scientific mind  she liked flowers  she was so exact 
2776,what was this mania of hers for marriage 
2777,lily wondered  stepping to and fro from her easel 
2778, suddenly  as suddenly as a star slides in the sky  a reddish light seemed to burn in her mind  covering paul rayley  issuing from him  it rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a distant beach  she heard the roar and the crackle  the whole sea for miles round ran red and gold  some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her  for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a beach  and the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and disgust  as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house  greedily  disgustingly  and she loathed it  but for a sight  for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience  and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea  and one had only to say  in love  and instantly  as happened now  up rose paul own fire again  and it sank and she said to herself  laughing   the rayleys   how paul went to coffee houses and played chess  
2779,she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though  she thought 
2780,she had been looking at the table cloth  and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle  and need never marry anybody  and she had felt an enormous exultation 
2781,she had felt  now she could stand up to mrs  ramsay   a tribute to the astonishing power that mrs  ramsay had over one 
2782,do this  she said  and one did it 
2783,even her shadow at the window with james was full of authority 
2784,she remembered how william bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son 
2785,did she not admire their beauty 
2786,he said 
2787,but william  she remembered  had listened to her with his wise child own eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence  how a light there needed a shadow there and so on 
2788,she did not intend to disparage a subject which  they agreed  raphael had treated divinely 
2789,she was not cynical 
2790,quite the contrary 
2791,thanks to his scientific mind he understood   a proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted her enormously 
2792,one could talk of painting then seriously to a man 
2793,indeed  his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life 
2794,she loved william bankes 
2795,they went to hampton court and he always left her  like the perfect gentleman he was  plenty of time to wash her hands  while he strolled by the river 
2796,that was typical of their relationship 
2797,many things were left unsaid 
2798,then they strolled through the courtyards  and admired  summer after summer  the proportions and the flowers  and he would tell her things  about perspective  about architecture  as they walked  and he would stop to look at a tree  or the view over the lake  and admire a child    it was his great grief   he had no daughter  in the vague aloof way that was natural to a man who spent spent so much time in laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to dazzle him  so that he walked slowly  lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused  with his head thrown back  merely to breathe the air 
2799,then he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday  he must buy a new carpet for the staircase 
2800,perhaps she would go with him to buy a new carpet for the staircase 
2801,and once something led him to talk about the ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been wearing a grey hat  she was not more than nineteen or twenty 
2802,she was astonishingly beautiful 
2803,there he stood looking down the avenue at hampton court as if he could see her there among the fountains 
2804,she looked now at the drawing room step 
2805,she saw  through william own eyes  the shape of a woman  peaceful and silent  with downcast eyes 
2806,she sat musing  pondering  she was in grey that day  lily thought  
2807,her eyes were bent 
2808,she would never lift them 
2809,yes  thought lily  looking intently  i must have seen her look like that  but not in grey  nor so still  nor so young  nor so peaceful 
2810,the figure came readily enough 
2811,she was astonishingly beautiful  as william said 
2812,but beauty was not everything 
2813,beauty had this penalty   it came too readily  came too completely 
2814,it stilled life   froze it 
2815,one forgot the little agitations  the flush  the pallor  some queer distortion  some light or shadow  which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after 
2816,it was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty 
2817,but what was the look she had  lily wondered  when she clapped her deer stalkers own hat on her head  or ran across the grass  or scolded kennedy  the gardener 
2818,who could tell her 
2819,who could help her 
2820,against her will she had come to the surface  and found herself half out of the picture  looking  little dazedly  as if at unreal things  at mr  carmichael 
2821,he lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch not reading  or sleeping  but basking like a creature gorged with existence 
2822,his book had fallen on to the grass 
2823,she wanted to go straight up to him and say   mr  carmichael  
2824,then he would look up benevolently as always  from his smoky vague green eyes 
2825,but one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them 
2826,and she wanted to say not one thing  but everything 
2827,little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing 
2828, about life  about death  about mrs  ramsay    no  she thought  one could say nothing to nobody 
2829,the urgency of the moment always missed its mark 
2830,words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low 
2831,then one gave it up  then the idea sunk back again  then one became like most middle aged people  cautious  furtive  with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension 
2832,for how could one express in words these emotions of the body 
2833,express that emptiness there 
2834, she was looking at the drawing room steps  they looked extraordinarily empty  
2835,it was one own body feeling  not one own mind 
2836,the physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant 
2837,to want and not to have  sent all up her body a hardness  a hollowness  a strain 
2838,and then to want and not to have   to want and want   how that wrung the heart  and wrung it again and again 
2839,oh  mrs  ramsay  she called out silently  to that essence which sat by the boat  that abstract one made of her  that woman in grey  as if to abuse her for having gone  and then having gone  come back again 
2840,it had seemed so safe  thinking of her 
2841,ghost  air  nothingness  a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time of day or night  she had been that  and then suddenly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus 
2842,suddenly  the empty drawing room steps  the frill of the chair inside  the puppy tumbling on the terrace  the whole wave and whisper of the garden became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness 
2843, what does it mean  how do you explain it all   she wanted to say  turning to mr  carmichael again 
2844,for the whole world seemed to have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought  a deep basin of reality  and one could almost fancy that had mr  carmichael spoken  for instance  a little tear would have rent the surface pool 
2845,and then 
2846,something would emerge 
2847,a hand would be shoved up  a blade would be flashed 
2848,it was nonsense of course 
2849,a curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the things she could not say 
2850,he was an inscrutable old man  with the yellow stain on his beard  and his poetry  and his puzzles  sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants  so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted 
2851,she looked at her picture 
2852,that would have been his answer  presumably   how  you  and  i  and  she  pass and vanish  nothing stays  all changes  but not words  not paint 
2853,yet it would be hung in the attics  she thought  it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa  yet even so  even of a picture like that  it was true 
2854,one might say  even of this scrawl  not of that actual picture  perhaps  but of what it attempted  that it  remained for ever   she was going to say  or  for the words spoken sounded even to herself  too boastful  to hint  wordlessly  when  looking at the picture  she was surprised to find that she could not see it 
2855,her eyes were full of a hot liquid  she did not think of tears at first  which  without disturbing the firmness of her lips  made the air thick  rolled down her cheeks 
2856,she had perfect control of herself   oh  yes 
2857,  in every other way 
2858,was she crying then for mrs  ramsay  without being aware of any unhappiness 
2859,she addressed old mr  carmichael again 
2860,what was it then 
2861,what did it mean 
2862,could things thrust their hands up and grip one  could the blade cut  the fist grasp 
2863,was there no safety 
2864,no learning by heart of the ways of the world 
2865,no guide  no shelter  but all was miracle  and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air 
2866,could it be  even for elderly people  that this was life 
2867,  startling  unexpected  unknown 
2868,for one moment she felt that if they both got up  here  now on the lawn  and demanded an explanation  why was it so short  why was it so inexplicable  said it with violence  as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak  then  beauty would roll itself up  the space would fill  those empty flourishes would form into shape  if they shouted loud enough mrs  ramsay would return 
2869, mrs  ramsay   she said aloud   mrs  ramsay  
2870,the tears ran down her face 
2871,macalister own boy took one of the fish and cut a square out of its side to bait his hook with 
2872,the mutilated body  it was alive still  was thrown back into the sea 
2873, mrs  ramsay  
2874,lily cried   mrs  ramsay  
2875,but nothing happened 
2876,the pain increased 
2877,that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of imbecility  she thought 
2878,anyhow the old man had not heard her 
2879,he remained benignant  calm   if one chose to think it  sublime 
2880,heaven be praised  no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry  stop pain  stop 
2881,she had not obviously taken leave of her senses 
2882,no one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation 
2883,she remained a skimpy old maid  holding a paint brush 
2884,and now slowly the pain of the want  and the bitter anger  to be called back  just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for mrs  ramsay again  had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast  not in the least  lessened  and of their anguish left  as antidote  a relief that was balm in itself  and also  but more mysteriously  a sense of some one there  of mrs  ramsay  relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her  staying lightly by her side and then  for this was mrs  ramsay in all her beauty  raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went 
2885,lily squeezed her tubes again 
2886,she attacked that problem of the hedge 
2887,it was strange how clearly she saw her  stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds  purplish and soft  among whose flowers  hyacinth or lilies  she vanished 
2888,it was some trick of the painter own eye 
2889,for days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus  putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion  a shade across the fields 
2890,the sight  the phrase  had its power to console 
2891,wherever she happened to be  painting  here  in the country or in london  the vision would come to her  and her eyes  half closing  sought something to base her vision on 
2892,she looked down the railway carriage  the omnibus  took a line from shoulder or cheek  looked at the windows opposite  at piccadilly  lamp strung in the evening 
2893,all had been part of the fields of death 
2894,but always something   it might be a face  a voice  a paper boy crying standard  news   thrust through  snubbed her  waked her  required and got in the end an effort of attention  so that the vision must be perpetually remade 
2895,now again  moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue  she looked at the bay beneath her  making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves  and stony fields of the purpler spaces  again she was roused as usual by something incongruous 
2896,there was a brown spot in the middle of the bay 
2897,it was a boat 
2898,yes  she realised that after a second 
2899,but whose boat 
2900,mr  ramsay own boat  she replied 
2901,mr  ramsay  the man who had marched past her  with his hand raised  aloof  at the head of a procession  in his beautiful boots  asking her for sympathy  which she had refused 
2902,the boat was now half way across the bay 
2903,so fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric  as if sails were stuck high up in the sky  or the clouds had dropped down into the sea 
2904,a steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively  as if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh  only gently swaying them this way and that 
2905,and as happens sometimes when the weather is very fine  the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships  and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs  as if they signalled to each other some message of their own 
2906,for sometimes quite close to the shore  the lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous distance away 
2907, where are they now  
2908,lily thought  looking out to sea 
2909,where was he  that very old man who had gone past her silently  holding a brown paper parcel under his arm 
2910,the boat was in the middle of the bay 
2911,they do not feel a thing there  cam thought  looking at the shore  which  rising and falling  became steadily more distant and more peaceful 
2912,her hand cut a trail in the sea  as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and  numbed and shrouded  wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays  where in the green light a change came over one own entire mind and one own body shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak 
2913,then the eddy slackened round her hand 
2914,the rush of the water ceased  the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds 
2915,one heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour 
2916,everything became very close to one 
2917,for the sail  upon which james had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew  sagged entirely  there they came to a stop  flapping about waiting for a breeze  in the hot sun  miles from shore  miles from the lighthouse 
2918,everything in the whole world seemed to stand still 
2919,the lighthouse became immovable  and the line of the distant shore became fixed 
2920,the sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other own presence  which they had almost forgotten 
2921,macalister own fishing line went plumb down into the sea 
2922,but mr  ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him 
2923,he was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover own egg 
2924,now and again  as they hung about in that horrid calm  he turned a page 
2925,and james felt that each page was turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him  now assertively  now commandingly  now with the intention of making people pity him  and all the time  as his father read and turned one after another of those little pages  james kept dreading the moment when he would look up and speak sharply to him about something or other 
2926,why were they lagging about here 
2927,he would demand  or something quite unreasonable like that 
2928,and if he does  james thought  then i shall take a knife and strike him to the heart 
2929,he had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart 
2930,only now  as he grew older  and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage  it was not him  that old man reading  whom he wanted to kill  but it was the thing that descended on him   without his knowing it perhaps  that fierce sudden black winged harpy  with its talons and its beak all cold and hard  that struck and struck at you  he could feel the beak on his bare legs  where it had struck when he was a child  and then made off  and there he was again  an old man  very sad  reading his book 
2931,that he would kill  that he would strike to the heart 
2932,whatever he did    and he might do anything  he felt  looking at the lighthouse and the distant shore  whether he was in a business  in a bank  a barrister  a man at the head of some enterprise  that he would fight  that he would track down and stamp out   tyranny  despotism  he called it   making people do what they did not want to do  cutting off their right to speak 
2933,how could any of them say  but i will not  when he said  come to the lighthouse 
2934,do this 
2935,fetch me that 
2936,the black wings spread  and the hard beak tore 
2937,and then next moment  there he sat reading his book  and he might look up   one never knew   quite reasonably 
2938,he might talk to the macalisters 
2939,he might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman own hand in the street  james thought  and he might be shouting out at some fisherman own sports  he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement 
2940,or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other 
2941,yes  thought james  while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun  there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere  and there he had come to feel  quite often lately  when his father said something or did something which surprised the others  there were two pairs of footprints only  his own and his father own 
2942,they alone knew each other 
2943,what then was this terror  this hatred 
2944,turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him  peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted  and one blunders  now with the sun in one own eyes  now with a dark shadow  he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape 
2945,suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator  or on some one own knee  he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently  some one own foot 
2946,suppose he had seen the foot first  in the grass  smooth  and whole  then the wheel  and the same foot  purple  crushed 
2947,but the wheel was innocent 
2948,so now  when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the lighthouse down it came over his foot  over cam own foot  over anybody own foot 
2949,one sat and watched it 
2950,but whose foot was he thinking of  and in what garden did all this happen 
2951,for one had settings for these scenes  trees that grew there  flowers  a certain light  a few figures 
2952,everything tended to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom 
2953,none of this throwing of hands about  people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice 
2954,they went in and out all day long 
2955,there was an old woman gossiping in the kitchen  and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze  all was blowing  all was growing  and over all those plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn  like a vine leaf  at night 
2956,things became stiller and darker at night 
2957,but the leaf like veil was so fine  that lights lifted it  voices crinkled it  he could see through it a figure stooping  hear  coming close  going away  some dress rustling  some chain tinkling 
2958,it was in this world that the wheel went over the person own foot 
2959,something  he remembered  stayed flourished up in the air  something arid and sharp descended even there  like a blade  a scimitar  smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it shrivel and fall 
2960, it will rain   he remembered his father saying 
2961, you will not be able to go to the lighthouse  
2962,the lighthouse was then a silvery  misty looking tower with a yellow eye  that opened suddenly  and softly in the evening 
2963,now  
2964,james looked at the lighthouse 
2965,he could see the white washed rocks  the tower  stark and straight  he could see that it was barred with black and white  he could see windows in it  he could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry 
2966,so that was the lighthouse  was it 
2967,no  the other was also the lighthouse 
2968,for nothing was simply one thing 
2969,the other lighthouse was true too 
2970,it was sometimes hardly to be seen across the bay 
2971,in the evening one looked up and saw the eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them in that airy sunny garden where they sat 
2972,but he pulled himself up 
2973,whenever he said  they  or  a person   and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming  the tinkle of some one going  he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever might be in the room 
2974,it was his father now 
2975,the strain was acute 
2976,for in one moment if there was no breeze  his father would slap the covers of his book together  and say   what is happening now  what are we dawdling about here for  eh   as  once before he had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over  and if there had been an axe handy  a knife  or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart 
2977,she had gone stiff all over  and then  her arm slackening  so that he felt she listened to him no longer  she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there  impotent  ridiculous  sitting on the floor grasping a pair of scissors 
2978,not a breath of wind blew 
2979,the water chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them 
2980,at any moment mr  ramsay  he scarcely dared look at him  might rouse himself  shut his book  and say something sharp  but for the moment he was reading  so that james stealthily  as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet  afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board  went on thinking what was she like  where did she go that day 
2981,he began following her from room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light  as if the reflection came from many china dishes  she talked to somebody  he listened to her talking 
2982,she talked to a servant  saying simply whatever came into her head 
2983,she alone spoke the truth  to her alone could he speak it 
2984,that was the source of her everlasting attraction for him  perhaps  she was a person to whom one could say what came into one own head 
2985,but all the time he thought of her  he was conscious of his father following his thought  surveying it  making it shiver and falter 
2986,at last he ceased to think 
2987,there he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun  staring at the lighthouse  powerless to move  powerless to flick off these grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another 
2988,a rope seemed to bind him there  and his father had knotted it and he could only escape by taking a knife and plunging it   but at that moment the sail swung slowly round  filled slowly out  the boat seemed to shake herself  and then to move off half conscious in her sleep  and then she woke and shot through the waves 
2989,the relief was extraordinary 
2990,they all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their ease  and the fishing lines slanted taut across the side of the boat 
2991,but his father did not rouse himself 
2992,he only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air  and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony 
2993,the sea without a stain on it  thought lily briscoe  still standing and looking out over the bay 
2994,the sea stretched like silk across the bay 
2995,distance had an extraordinary power  they had been swallowed up in it  she felt  they were gone for ever  they had become part of the nature of things 
2996,it was so calm  it was so quiet 
2997,the steamer itself had vanished  but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction 
2998,it was like that then  the island  thought cam  once more drawing her fingers through the waves 
2999,she had never seen it from out at sea before 
3000,it lay like that on the sea  did it  with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags  and the sea swept in there  and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island 
3001,it was very small  shaped something like a leaf stood on end 
3002,so we took a little boat  she thought  beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship 
3003,but with the sea streaming through her fingers  a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them  she did not want to tell herself seriously a story  it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted  for she was thinking  as the boat sailed on  how her father own anger about the points of the compass  james own obstinacy about the compact  and her own anguish  all had slipped  all had passed  all had streamed away 
3004,what then came next 
3005,where were they going 
3006,from her hand  ice cold  held deep in the sea  there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change  at the escape  at the adventure  that she should be alive  that she should be there  
3007,and the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark  the slumbrous shapes in her mind  shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness  catching here and there  a spark of light  greece  rome  constantinople 
3008,small as it was  and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold  sprinkled waters flowing in and about it  it had  she supposed  a place in the universe   even that little island 
3009,the old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her 
3010,sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it 
3011,there they were  it might be mr  carmichael or mr  bankes who was sitting with her father  sitting opposite each other in their low arm chairs 
3012,they were crackling in front of them the pages of the times  when she came in from the garden  all in a muddle  about something some one had said about christ  or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a london street  or wondering what napoleon was like 
3013,then they took all this with their clean hands  they wore grey coloured clothes  they smelt of heather  and they brushed the scraps together  turning the paper  crossing their knees  and said something now and then very brief 
3014,just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there  watching her father write  so equally  so neatly from one side of the page to another  with a little cough now and then  or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite 
3015,and she thought  standing there with her book open  one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water  and if it did well here  among the old gentlemen smoking and the times crackling then it was right 
3016,and watching her father as he wrote in his study  she thought  now sitting in the boat  he was not vain  nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him 
3017,indeed  if he saw she was there  reading a book  he would ask her  as gently as any one could  was there nothing he could give her 
3018,lest this should be wrong  she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover own egg 
3019,no  it was right 
3020,look at him now  she wanted to say aloud to james 
3021, but james had his eye on the sail  
3022,he is a sarcastic brute  james would say 
3023,he brings the talk round to himself and his books  james would say 
3024,he is intolerably egotistical 
3025,worst of all  he is a tyrant 
3026,but look  she said  looking at him 
3027,look at him now 
3028,she looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled  the little book whose yellowish pages she knew  without knowing what was written on them 
3029,it was small  it was closely printed  on the fly leaf  she knew  he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner  the wine had been so much  he had given so much to the waiter  all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page 
3030,but what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket  she did not know 
3031,what he thought they none of them knew 
3032,but he was absorbed in it  so that when he looked up  as he did now for an instant  it was not to see anything  it was to pin down some thought more exactly 
3033,that done  his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading 
3034,he read  she thought  as if he were guiding something  or wheedling a large flock of sheep  or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path  and sometimes he went fast and straight  and broke his way through the bramble  and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him  a bramble blinded him  but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that  on he went  tossing over page after page 
3035,and she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship  for she was safe  while he sat there  safe  as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden  and took a book down  and the old gentleman  lowering the paper suddenly  said something very brief over the top of it about the character of napoleon 
3036,she gazed back over the sea  at the island 
3037,but the leaf was losing its sharpness 
3038,it was very small  it was very distant 
3039,the sea was more important now than the shore 
3040,waves were all round them  tossing and sinking  with a log wallowing down one wave  a gull riding on another 
3041,about here  she thought  dabbling her fingers in the water  a ship had sunk  and she murmured  dreamily half asleep  how we perished  each alone 
3042,so much depends then  thought lily briscoe  looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it  which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue  so much depends  she thought  upon distance  whether people are near us or far from us  for her feeling for mr  ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay 
3043,it seemed to be elongated  stretched out  he seemed to become more and more remote 
3044,he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue  that distance  but here  on the lawn  close at hand  mr  carmichael suddenly grunted 
3045,she laughed 
3046,he clawed his book up from the grass 
3047,he settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster 
3048,that was different altogether  because he was so near 
3049,and now again all was quiet 
3050,they must be out of bed by this time  she supposed  looking at the house  but nothing appeared there 
3051,but then  she remembered  they had always made off directly a meal was over  on business of their own 
3052,it was all in keeping with this silence  this emptiness  and the unreality of the early morning hour 
3053,it was a way things had sometimes  she thought  lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke  they became illness  before habits had spun themselves across the surface  one felt that same unreality  which was so startling  felt something emerge 
3054,life was most vivid then 
3055,one could be at one own ease 
3056,mercifully one need not say  very briskly  crossing the lawn to greet old mrs  beckwith  who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in   oh  good morning  mrs  beckwith  what a lovely day  are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun  jasper own hidden the chairs  do let me find you one   and all the rest of the usual chatter 
3057,one need not speak at all 
3058,one glided  one shook one own sails  there was a good deal of movement in the bay  boats were starting off  between things  beyond things 
3059,empty it was not  but full to the brim 
3060,she seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance  to move and float and sink in it  yes  for these waters were unfathomably deep 
3061,into them had spilled so many lives 
3062,the ramsays   the children own  and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides 
3063,a washer woman with her basket  a rook  a red hot poker  the purples and grey greens of flowers  some common feeling which held the whole together 
3064,it was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which  ten years ago  standing almost where she stood now  had made her say that she must be in love with the place 
3065,love had a thousand shapes 
3066,there might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the elements of things and place them together and so  giving them a wholeness not theirs in life  make of some scene  or meeting of people  all now gone and separate   one of those globed compacted things over which thought lingers  and love plays 
3067,her eyes rested on the brown speck of mr  ramsay own sailing boat 
3068,they would be at the lighthouse by lunch time she supposed 
3069,but the wind had freshened  and  as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed slightly and the boats altered their positions  the view  which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed  was now unsatisfactory 
3070,the wind had blown the trail of smoke about  there was something displeasing about the placing of the ships 
3071,the disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind 
3072,she felt an obscure distress 
3073,it was confirmed when she turned to her picture 
3074,she had been wasting her morning 
3075,for whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite forces  mr  ramsay and the picture  which was necessary 
3076,there was something perhaps wrong with the design 
3077,was it  she wondered  that the line of the wall wanted breaking  was it that the mass of the trees was too heavy 
3078,she smiled ironically  for had she not thought  when she began  that she had solved her problem 
3079,what was the problem then 
3080,she must try to get hold of something tht evaded her 
3081,it evaded her when she thought of mrs  ramsay  it evaded her now when she thought of her picture 
3082,phrases came 
3083,visions came 
3084,beautiful pictures 
3085,beautiful phrases 
3086,but what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves  the thing itself before it has been made anything 
3087,get that and start afresh  get that and start afresh  she said desperately  pitching herself firmly again before her easel 
3088,it was a miserable machine  an inefficient machine  she thought  the human apparatus for painting or for feeling  it always broke down at the critical moment  heroically  one must force it on 
3089,she stared  frowning 
3090,there was the hedge  sure enough 
3091,but one got nothing by soliciting urgently 
3092,one got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the wall  or from thinking   she wore a grey hat 
3093,she was astonishingly beautiful 
3094,let it come  she thought  if it will come 
3095,for there are moments when one can neither think nor feel 
3096,and if one can neither think nor feel  she thought  where is one 
3097,here on the grass  on the ground  she thought  sitting down  and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains 
3098,for the lawn was very rough 
3099,here sitting on the world  she thought  for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time  perhaps for the last time  as a traveller  even though he is half asleep  knows  looking out of the train window  that he must look now  for he will never see that town  or that mule cart  or that woman at work in the fields  again 
3100,the lawn was the world  they were up here together  on this exalted station  she thought  looking at old mr  carmichael  who seemed  though they had not said a word all this time  to share her thoughts 
3101,and she would never see him again perhaps 
3102,he was growing old 
3103,also  she remembered  smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot  he was growing famous 
3104,people said that his poetry was  so beautiful  
3105,they went and published things he had written forty years ago 
3106,there was a famous man now called carmichael  she smiled  thinking how many shapes one person might wear  how he was that in the newspapers  but here the same as he had always been 
3107,he looked the same   greyer  rather 
3108,yes  he looked the same  but somebody had said  she recalled  that when he had heard of andrew ramsay own death  he was killed in a second by a she will  he should have been a great mathematician  mr  carmichael had  lost all interest in life  
3109,what did it mean   that 
3110,she wondered 
3111,had he marched through trafalgar square grasping a big stick 
3112,had he turned pages over and over  without reading them  sitting in his room in st  john own wood alone 
3113,she did not know what he had done  when he heard that andrew was killed  but she felt it in him all the same 
3114,they only mumbled at each other on staircases  they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it will not be fine 
3115,but this was one way of knowing people  she thought  to know the outline  not the detail  to sit in one own garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather 
3116,she knew him in that way 
3117,she knew that he had changed somehow 
3118,she had never read a line of his poetry 
3119,she thought that she knew how it went though  slowly and sonorously 
3120,it was seasoned and mellow 
3121,it was about the desert and the camel 
3122,it was about the palm tree and the sunset 
3123,it was extremely impersonal  it said something about death  it said very little about love 
3124,there was an impersonality about him 
3125,he wanted very little of other people 
3126,had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing room window with some newspaper under his arm  trying to avoid mrs  ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like 
3127,on that account  of course  she would always try to make him stop 
3128,he would bow to her 
3129,he would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly 
3130,annoyed that he did not want anything of her  mrs  ramsay would ask him  lily could hear her  would not he like a coat  a rug  a newspaper 
3131,no  he wanted nothing 
3132, here he bowed  
3133,there was some quality in her which he did not much like 
3134,it was perhaps her masterfulness  her positiveness  something matter of fact in her 
3135,she was so direct 
3136, a noise drew her attention to the drawing room window   the squeak of a hinge  the light breeze was toying with the window  
3137,there must have been people who disliked her very much  lily thought  yes  she realised that the drawing room step was empty  but it had no effect on her whatever  she did not want mrs  ramsay now     people who thought her too sure  too drastic 
3138,also  her beauty offended people probably 
3139,how monotonous  they would say  and the same always 
3140,they preferred another type   the dark  the vivacious 
3141,then she was weak with her husband 
3142,she let him make those scenes 
3143,then she was reserved 
3144,nobody knew exactly what had happened to her 
3145,and  to go back to mr  carmichael and his dislike  one could not imagine mrs  ramsay standing painting  lying reading  a whole morning on the lawn 
3146,it was unthinkable 
3147,without saying a word  the only token of her errand a basket on her arm  she went off to the town  to the poor  to sit in some stuffy little bedroom 
3148,often and often lily had seen her go silently in the midst of some game  some discussion  with her basket on her arm  very upright 
3149,she had noted her return 
3150,she had thought  half laughing  she was so methodical with the tea cups   half moved  her beauty took one own breath away   eyes that are closing in pain have looked on you 
3151,you have been with them there 
3152,and then mrs  ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late  or the butter not fresh  or the teapot chipped 
3153,and all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of greek temples  and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room 
3154,she never talked of it   she went  punctually  directly 
3155,it was her instinct to go  an instinct like the swallows for the south  the artichokes for the sun  turning her infallibly to the human race  making her nest in its heart 
3156,and this  like all instincts  was a little distressing to people who did not share it  to mr  carmichael perhaps  to herself certainly 
3157,some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action  the supremacy of thought 
3158,her going was a reproach to them  gave a different twist to the world  so that they were led to protest  seeing their own prepossessions disappear  and clutch at them vanishing 
3159,charles tansley did that too  it was part of the reason why one disliked him 
3160,he upset the proportions of one own world 
3161,and what had happened to him  she wondered  idly stirring the platains with her brush 
3162,he had got his fellowship 
3163,he had married  he lived at golder own green 
3164,she had gone one day into a hall and heard him speaking during the war 
3165,he was denouncing something  he was condemning somebody 
3166,he was preaching brotherly love 
3167,and all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another  who had stood behind her smoking shag   fivepence an ounce  miss briscoe   and making it his business to tell her women cannot write  women cannot paint  not so much that he believed it  as that for some odd reason he wished it 
3168,there he was lean and red and raucous  preaching love from a platform  there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush   red  energetic  shiny ants  rather like charles tansley  
3169,she had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half empty hall  pumping love into that chilly space  and suddenly  there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and mrs  ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles 
3170, oh  dear  what a nuisance  lost again  do not bother  mr  tansley  i lose thousands every summer   at which he pressed his chin back against his collar  as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration  but could stand it in her whom he liked  and smiled very charmingly 
3171,he must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone 
3172,he was educating his little sister  mrs  ramsay had told her 
3173,it was immensely to his credit 
3174,her own idea of him was grotesque  lily knew well  stirring the plantains with her brush 
3175,half one own notions of other people were  after all  grotesque 
3176,they served private purposes of one own own 
3177,he did for her instead of a whipping boy 
3178,she found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper 
3179,if she wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to mrs  ramsay own sayings  to look at him through her eyes 
3180,she raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over 
3181,she reduced them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in their cosmogony 
3182,some ran this way  others that 
3183,one wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with  she reflected 
3184,fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with  she thought 
3185,among them  must be one that was stone blind to her beauty 
3186,one wanted most some secret sense  fine as air  with which to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting  talking  sitting silent in the window alone  which took to itself and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer  her thoughts  her imaginations  her desires 
3187,what did the hedge mean to her  what did the garden mean to her  what did it mean to her when a wave broke 
3188, lily looked up  as she had seen mrs  ramsay look up  she too heard a wave falling on the beach  
3189,and then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried   how is that  how is that   cricketing 
3190,she would stop knitting for a second 
3191,she would look intent 
3192,then she would lapse again  and suddenly mr  ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over her and looked down at her 
3193,lily could see him 
3194,he stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair 
3195,it seemed somehow as if he had done it before  as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which  lying a few inches off some island  had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen 
3196,an old fashioned scene that was  which required  very nearly  crinolines and peg top trousers 
3197,letting herself be helped by him  mrs  ramsay had thought  lily supposed  the time has come now 
3198,yes  she would say it now 
3199,yes  she would marry him 
3200,and she stepped slowly  quietly on shore 
3201,probably she said one word only  letting her hand rest still in his 
3202,i will marry you  she might have said  with her hand in his  but no more 
3203,time after time the same thrill had passed between them   obviously it had  lily thought  smoothing a way for her ants 
3204,she was not inventing  she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up  something she had seen 
3205,for in the rough and tumble of daily life  with all those children about  all those visitors  one had constantly a sense of repetition   of one thing falling where another had fallen  and so setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations 
3206,but it would be a mistake  she thought  thinking how they walked off together  arm in arm  past the greenhouse  to simplify their relationship 
3207,it was no monotony of bliss   she with her impulses and quicknesses  he with his shudders and glooms 
3208,oh  no 
3209,the bedroom door would slam violently early in the morning 
3210,he would start from the table in a temper 
3211,he would whizz his plate through the window 
3212,then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and blinds fluttering  as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship  shape 
3213,she had met paul rayley like that one day on the stairs 
3214,they had laughed and laughed  like a couple of children  all because mr  ramsay  finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside 
3215, an earwig  prue murmured  awestruck   in his milk  
3216,other people might find centipedes 
3217,but he had built round him such a fence of sanctity  and occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig in his milk was a monster 
3218,but it tired mrs  ramsay  it cowed her a little   the plates whizzing and the doors slamming 
3219,and there would fall between them sometimes long rigid silences  when  in a state of mind which annoyed lily in her  half plaintive  half resentful  she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly  or to laugh as they laughed  but in her weariness perhaps concealed something 
3220,she brooded and sat silent 
3221,after a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was   roaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking  for she would take care to be busy when he passed  and evade him  and pretend not to see him 
3222,then he would turn smooth as silk  affable  urbane  and try to win her so 
3223,still she would hold off  and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without  would turn her head  would look so  over her shoulder  always with some minta  paul  or william bankes at her side 
3224,at length  standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound  lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps  at the window  where she had seen him   he would say her name  once only  for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow  but still she held back  and he would say it once more  and this time something in the tone would rouse her  and she would go to him  leaving them all of a sudden  and they would walk off together among the pear trees  the cabbages  and the raspberry beds 
3225,they would have it out together 
3226,but with what attitudes and with what words 
3227,such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that  turning away  she and paul and minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort  and begin picking flowers  throwing balls  chattering  until it was time for dinner  and there they were  he at one end of the table  she at the other  as usual 
3228, why do not some of you take up botany    with all those legs and arms why does not one of you     
3229,so they would talk as usual  laughing  among the children 
3230,all would be as usual  save only for some quiver  as of a blade in the air  which came and went between them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and the cabbages 
3231,especially  lily thought  mrs  ramsay would glance at prue 
3232,she sat in the middle between brothers and sisters  always occupied  it seemed  seeing that nothing went wrong so that she scarcely spoke herself 
3233,how prue must have blamed herself for that earwig in the milk how white she had gone when mr  ramsay threw his plate through the window 
3234,how she drooped under those long silences between them 
3235,anyhow  her mother now would seem to be making it up to her  assuring her that everything was well  promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be hers 
3236,she had enjoyed it for less than a year  however 
3237,she had let the flowers fall from her basket  lily thought  screwing up her eyes and standing back as if to look at her picture  which she was not touching  however  with all her faculties in a trance  frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed 
3238,she let her flowers fall from her basket  scattered and tumbled them on to the grass and  reluctantly and hesitatingly  but without question or complaint   had she not the faculty of obedience to perfection 
3239,  went too 
3240,down fields  across valleys  white  flower strewn   that was how she would have painted it 
3241,the hills were austere 
3242,it was rocky  it was steep 
3243,the waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath 
3244,they went  the three of them together  mrs  ramsay walking rather fast in front  as if she expected to meet some one round the corner 
3245,suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light stuff behind it 
3246,at last then somebody had come into the drawing room  somebody was sitting in the chair 
3247,for heaven own sake  she prayed  let them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her 
3248,mercifully  whoever it was stayed still inside  had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd shaped triangular shadow over the step 
3249,it altered the composition of the picture a little 
3250,it was interesting 
3251,it might be useful 
3252,her mood was coming back to her 
3253,one must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion  the determination not to be put off  not to be bamboozled 
3254,one must hold the scene   so   in a vise and let nothing come in and spoil it 
3255,one wanted  she thought  dipping her brush deliberately  to be on a level with ordinary experience  to feel simply that is a chair  that is a table  and yet at the same time  it is a miracle  it is an ecstasy 
3256,the problem might be solved after all 
3257,ah  but what had happened 
3258,some wave of white went over the window pane 
3259,the air must have stirred some flounce in the room 
3260,her heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her 
3261, mrs  ramsay  mrs  ramsay   she cried  feeling the old horror come back   to want and want and not to have 
3262,could she inflict that still 
3263,and then  quietly  as if she refrained  that too became part of ordinary experience  was on a level with the chair  with the table 
3264,mrs  ramsay   it was part of her perfect goodness   sat there quite simply  in the chair  flicked her needles to and fro  knitted her reddish brown stocking  cast her shadow on the step 
3265,there she sat 
3266,and as if she had something she must share  yet could hardly leave her easel  so full her mind was of what she was thinking  of what she was seeing  lily went past mr  carmichael holding her brush to the edge of the lawn 
3267,where was that boat now 
3268,and mr  ramsay 
3269,she wanted him 
3270,mr  ramsay had almost done reading 
3271,one hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it 
3272,he sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about  extraordinarily exposed to everything 
3273,he looked very old 
3274,he looked  james thought  getting his head now against the lighthouse  now against the waste of waters running away into the open  like some old stone lying on the sand  he looked as if he had become physically what was always at the back of both of their minds   that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things 
3275,he was reading very quickly  as if he were eager to get to the end 
3276,indeed they were very close to the lighthouse now 
3277,there it loomed up  stark and straight  glaring white and black  and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks 
3278,one could see lines and creases in the rocks 
3279,one could see the windows clearly  a dab of white on one of them  and a little tuft of green on the rock 
3280,a man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again 
3281,so it was like that  james thought  the lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years  it was a stark tower on a bare rock 
3282,it satisfied him 
3283,it confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character 
3284,the old ladies  he thought  thinking of the garden at home  went dragging their chairs about on the lawn 
3285,old mrs  beckwith  for example  was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy  but as a matter of fact  james thought  looking at the lighthouse stood there on its rock  it is like that 
3286,he looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight 
3287,they shared that knowledge 
3288, we are driving before a gale   we must sink   he began saying to himself  half aloud  exactly as his father said it 
3289,nobody seemed to have spoken for an age 
3290,cam was tired of looking at the sea 
3291,little bits of black cork had floated past  the fish were dead in the bottom of the boat 
3292,still her father read  and james looked at him and she looked at him  and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death  and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought 
3293,it was thus that he escaped  she thought 
3294,yes  with his great forehead and his great nose  holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him  he escaped 
3295,you might try to lay hands on him  but then like a bird  he spread his wings  he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump 
3296,she gazed at the immense expanse of the sea 
3297,the island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer 
3298,it looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover 
3299,yet in its frailty were all those paths  those terraces  those bedrooms   all those innumberable things 
3300,but as  just before sleep  things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself  so  she felt  looking drowsily at the island  all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing  and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind 
3301,it was a hanging garden  it was a valley  full of birds  and flowers  and antelopes   she was falling asleep 
3302, come now   said mr  ramsay  suddenly shutting his book 
3303,come where 
3304,to what extraordinary adventure 
3305,she woke with a start 
3306,to land somewhere  to climb somewhere 
3307,where was he leading them 
3308,for after his immense silence the words startled them 
3309,but it was absurd 
3310,he was hungry  he said 
3311,it was time for lunch 
3312,besides  look  he said 
3313, there is the lighthouse  we are almost there  
3314, he is doing very well   said macalister  praising james 
3315, he is keeping her very steady  
3316,but his father never praised him  james thought grimly 
3317,mr  ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them 
3318,now he was happy  eating bread and cheese with these fishermen 
3319,he would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour spitting with the other old men  james thought  watching him slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife 
3320,this is right  this is it  cam kept feeling  as she peeled her hard  boiled egg 
3321,now she felt as she did in the study when the old men were reading the times 
3322,now i can go on thinking whatever i like  and i shall not fall over a precipice or be drowned  for there he is  keeping his eye on me  she thought 
3323,at the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it was very exciting   it seemed as if they were doing two things at once  they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck 
3324,would the water last 
3325,would the provisions last 
3326,she asked herself  telling herself a story but knowing at the same time what was the truth 
3327,they would soon be out of it  mr  ramsay was saying to old macalister  but their children would see some strange things 
3328,macalister said he was seventy five last march  mr  ramsay was seventy one 
3329,macalister said he had never seen a doctor  he had never lost a tooth 
3330,and that is the way I would like my children to live   cam was sure that her father was thinking that  for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her  as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived  that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel 
3331,she should not waste it 
3332,he said it so wisely  as if he knew so well all the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once  and then he gave her  from his own parcel  a gingerbread nut  as if he were a great spanish gentleman  she thought  handing a flower to a lady at a window  so courteous his manner was  
3333,he was shabby  and simple  eating bread and cheese  and yet he was leading them on a great expedition where  for all she knew  they would be drowned 
3334, that was where she sunk   said macalister own boy suddenly 
3335,three men were drowned where we are now  the old man said 
3336,he had seen them clinging to the mast himself 
3337,and mr  ramsay taking a look at the spot was about  james and cam were afraid  to burst out 
3338,but i beneath a rougher sea 
3339,and if he did  they could not bear it  they would shriek aloud  they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him  but to their surprise all he said was  ah  as if he thought to himself 
3340,but why make a fuss about that 
3341,naturally men are drowned in a storm  but it is a perfectly straightforward affair  and the depths of the sea  he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them  are only water after all 
3342,then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch 
3343,he looked at it attentively  he made  perhaps  some mathematical calculation 
3344,at last he said  triumphantly 
3345, well done  
3346,james had steered them like a born sailor 
3347,there 
3348,cam thought  addressing herself silently to james 
3349,you have got it at last 
3350,for she knew that this was what james had been wanting  and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not look at her or at his father or at any one 
3351,there he sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright  looking rather sulky and frowning slightly 
3352,he was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure 
3353,his father had praised him 
3354,they must think that he was perfectly indifferent 
3355,but you have got it now  cam thought 
3356,they had tacked  and they were sailing swiftly  buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef 
3357,on the left a row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and became greener and on one  a higher rock  a wave incessantly broke and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower 
3358,one could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever 
3359,now they could see two men on the lighthouse  watching them and making ready to meet them 
3360,mr  ramsay buttoned his coat  and turned up his trousers 
3361,he took the large  badly packed  brown paper parcel which nancy had got ready and sat with it on his knee 
3362,thus in complete readiness to land he sat looking back at the island 
3363,with his long sighted eyes perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf like shape standing on end on a plate of gold quite clearly 
3364,what could he see 
3365,cam wondered 
3366,it was all a blur to her 
3367,what was he thinking now 
3368,she wondered 
3369,what was it he sought  so fixedly  so intently  so silently 
3370,they watched him  both of them  sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away 
3371,what do you want 
3372,they both wanted to ask 
3373,they both wanted to say  ask us anything and we will give it you 
3374,but he did not ask them anything 
3375,he sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking  we perished  each alone  or he might be thinking  i have reached it 
3376,i have found it  but he said nothing 
3377,then he put on his hat 
3378, bring those parcels   he said  nodding his head at the things nancy had done up for them to take to the lighthouse 
3379, the parcels for the lighthouse men   he said 
3380,he rose and stood in the bow of the boat  very straight and tall  for all the world  james thought  as if he were saying   there is no god   and cam thought  as if he were leaping into space  and they both rose to follow him as he sprang  lightly like a young man  holding his parcel  on to the rock 
3381, he must have reached it   said lily briscoe aloud  feeling suddenly completely tired out 
3382,for the lighthouse had become almost invisible  had melted away into a blue haze  and the effort of looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there  which both seemed to be one and the same effort  had stretched her body and mind to the utmost 
3383,ah  but she was relieved 
3384,whatever she had wanted to give him  when he left her that morning  she had given him at last 
3385, he has landed   she said aloud 
3386, it is finished  
3387,then  surging up  puffing slightly  old mr  carmichael stood beside her  looking like an old pagan god  shaggy  with weeds in his hair and the trident  it was only a french novel  in his hand 
3388,he stood by her on the edge of the lawn  swaying a little in his bulk and said  shading his eyes with his hand   they will have landed   and she felt that she had been right 
3389,they had not needed to speak 
3390,they had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything 
3391,he stood there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind  she thought he was surveying  tolerantly and compassionately  their final destiny 
3392,now he has crowned the occasion  she thought  when his hand slowly fell  as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which  fluttering slowly  lay at length upon the earth 
3393,quickly  as if she were recalled by something over there  she turned to her canvas 
3394,there it was   her picture 
3395,yes  with all its greens and blues  its lines running up and across  its attempt at something 
3396,it would be hung in the attics  she thought  it would be destroyed 
3397,but what did that matter 
3398,she asked herself  taking up her brush again 
3399,she looked at the steps  they were empty  she looked at her canvas  it was blurred 
3400,with a sudden intensity  as if she saw it clear for a second  she drew a line there  in the centre 
3401,it was done  it was finished 
3402,yes  she thought  laying down her brush in extreme fatigue  i have had my vision
