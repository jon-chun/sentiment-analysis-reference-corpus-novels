0,0,"I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,"I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never having seen any authentic record containing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2,"By far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,3,I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4,"They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,5,A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,6,The white children could tell their ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same privilege.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,8,I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,9,"He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10,The nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,11,"I come to this, from hearing my master say, some time during , I was about seventeen years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,12,My mother was named Harriet Bailey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,"She was the daughter of Isaac and Betsey Bailey, both colored, and quite dark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,14,My mother was of a darker complexion than either my grandmother or grandfather.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,15,My father was a white man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,16,He was admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,17,"The opinion was also whispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion, I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,18,My mother and I were separated when I was but an infant before I knew her as my mother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,19,"It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part children from their mothers at a very early age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,20,"Frequently, before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field labor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,21,"For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to hinder the development of the child s affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,22,This is the inevitable result.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,23,"I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in my life; and each of these times was very short in duration, and at night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,24,"She was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,25,"She made her journeys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, after the performance of her day s work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,26,"She was a field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has special permission from his or her master to the contrary a permission which they seldom get, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kind master.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,27,I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,28,She was with me in the night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,29,"She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but long before I waked she was gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,30,Very little communication ever took place between us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,31,"Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and with it her hardships and suffering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,32,"She died when I was about seven years old, on one of my master s farms, near Lee s Mill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,33,"I was not allowed to be present during her illness, at her death, or burial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,34,She was gone long before I knew any thing about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,35,"Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death with much the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,36,"Called thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation of who my father was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,37,"The whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst the fact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained, and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all cases follow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously to administer to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desires profitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of master and father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,38,"I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,"They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,40,"She is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,41,"The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and, cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval, it is set down to his parental partiality, and only makes a bad matter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,42,Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,43,"It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,44,"Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,45,"If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently their own masters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,46,I have had two masters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,47,My first master s name was Anthony.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,48,I do not remember his first name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,49,"He was generally called Captain Anthony a title which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,50,He was not considered a rich slaveholder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,51,"He owned two or three farms, and about thirty slaves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,52,His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,53,The overseer s name was Plummer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,54,"Mr. Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage monster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,55,He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,56,"I have known him to cut and slash the women s heads so horribly, that even master would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,57,"Master, however, was not a humane slaveholder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,58,It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,59,"He was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of slaveholding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,60,He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,61,"I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,62,"No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,63,"The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,64,"He would whip her to make her scream, and whip her to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,65,I remember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,66,"I was quite a child, but I well remember it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,67,I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,68,"It was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and a participant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,69,It struck me with awful force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,70,"It was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I was about to pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,71,It was a most terrible spectacle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,I wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,73,"This occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master, and under the following circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,74,"Aunt Hester went out one night, where or for what I do not know, and happened to be absent when my master desired her presence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,75,"He had ordered her not to go out evenings, and warned her that she must never let him catch her in company with a young man, who was paying attention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,76,"The young man s name was Ned Roberts, generally called Lloyd s Ned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,77,"Why master was so careful of her, may be safely left to conjecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,"She was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,"Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had been found in company with Lloyd s Ned; which circumstance, I found, from what he said while whipping her, was the chief offence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,80,"Had he been a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,81,"Before he commenced whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,82,"He then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same time a d d b -h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,"After crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in for the purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,"He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to the hook.",-0.0862086082733165,-0.11059169846065695,-0.11757074792020433,-0.0464425000743491,-0.08314367376137191,0.05133023527662553,-0.11771914833828825,-0.09242150686271876,-0.01875055120067259,-0.1311029225487252,-0.053610250271557136,0.024550525540939845,-0.7119391695961422,-0.8055949573900009,-1.2606375826101173,-1.0433334757848038,0.14685165188252666,1.4897190627002073,0.8027186376554283,-0.6529776818406917,-1.2838387749217366,-0.9346248231521592,0.6041040720418324,0.16821735665406293,0.05774074179750172,-1.7095415463639188,0.6965941681986583,0.04891484320587156,-2.2376987434491147,1.2035080095528075,0.009959674421680168

1618,1618,I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1619,1619,"The impression which I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly erroneous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1620,1620,"I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the south.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1621,1621,I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern people owned no slaves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1622,1622,I supposed that they were about upon a level with the non-slaveholding population of the south.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1623,1623,"I knew they were exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1624,1624,"I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1625,1625,"And upon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1626,1626,"Such being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1627,1627,"In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves, to take a view of the shipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1628,1628,Here I found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1629,1629,"Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1630,1630,"Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1631,1631,"Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1632,1632,There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1633,1633,I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1634,1634,I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1635,1635,"Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1636,1636,To me this looked exceedingly strange.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1637,1637,"From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding Maryland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1638,1638,"Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1639,1639,"I saw few or no dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael s, and Baltimore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1640,1640,"The people looked more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1641,1641,"I was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1642,1642,"But the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1643,1643,"I found many, who had not been seven years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1644,1644,"I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger, and he took me in ) lived in a neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral, religious, and political character of the nation, than nine tenths of the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1645,1645,Yet Mr. Johnson was a working man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1646,1646,"His hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but those also of Mrs. Johnson.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1647,1647,I found the colored people much more spirited than I had supposed they would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1648,1648,"I found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1649,1649,"Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1650,1650,A colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1651,1651,The former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1652,1652,"Straightway a meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice, Business of importance!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1653,1653,The betrayer was invited to attend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1654,1654,"The people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows: Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1655,1655,"With this, a number of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen in New Bedford since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1656,1656,"I believe there have been no more such threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1657,1657,"I found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1658,1658,"It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at it with a glad heart and a willing hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1659,1659,I was now my own master.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1660,1660,"It was a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1661,1661,"It was the first work, the reward of which was to be entirely my own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1662,1662,"There was no Master Hugh standing ready, the moment I earned the money, to rob me of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1663,1663,I worked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1664,1664,I was at work for myself and newly-married wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1665,1665,It was to me the starting-point of a new existence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1666,1666,"When I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of calking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get no employment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1667,1667,"[ ] Finding my trade of no immediate benefit, I threw off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of work I could get to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1668,1668,"Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse and saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1669,1669,There was no work too hard none too dirty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1670,1670,"I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry wood, sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks, all of which I did for nearly three years in New Bedford, before I became known to the anti-slavery world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1671,1671,[ ] I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford a result of anti-slavery effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1672,1672,"In about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young man to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the Liberator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1673,1673,"I told him I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I remarked that I was unable to pay for it then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1674,1674,"I, however, finally became a subscriber to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1675,1675,"The paper came, and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to describe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1676,1676,The paper became my meat and my drink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1677,1677,My soul was set all on fire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1678,1678,"Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds its scathing denunciations of slaveholders its faithful exposures of slavery and its powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institution sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as I had never felt before!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1679,1679,"I had not long been a reader of the Liberator, before I got a pretty correct idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery reform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1680,1680,I took right hold of the cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1681,1681,"I could do but little; but what I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1682,1682,"I seldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1683,1683,"But, while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the th of August, , I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard me speak in the colored people s meeting at New Bedford.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1684,1684,"It was a severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1685,1685,"The truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1686,1686,"I spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired with considerable ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1687,1687,"From that time until now, I have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren with what success, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my labors to decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
