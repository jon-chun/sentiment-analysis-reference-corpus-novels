Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my
age, never having seen any authentic record containing it. By far the
larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know
of theirs, and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to
keep their slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a
slave who could tell of his birthday. They seldom come nearer to it
than planting-time, harvest-time, cherry-time, spring-time, or
fall-time. A want of information concerning my own was a source of
unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white children could tell
their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the same
privilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master
concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave
improper and impertinent, and evidence of a restless spirit. The
nearest estimate I can give makes me now between twenty-seven and
twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearing my master say,
some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.",i was born in tuckahoe near hillsborough and about twelve miles from easton in talbot county maryland i have no accurate knowledge of my age never having seen any authentic record containing it by far the larger part of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs and it is the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thus ignorant i do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday they seldom come nearer to it than planting time harvest time cherry time spring time or fall time a want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood the white children could tell their ages i could not tell why i ought to be deprived of the same privilege i was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it he deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent and evidence of a restless spirit the nearest estimate i can give makes me now between twenty seven and twenty eight years of age i come to this from hearing my master say some time during  i was about seventeen years old,210,1146,0.8499999999999999,0.062051638529607205,0.15013404825737273,0.06879816688351471,-1.1500000000000001,-0.13488828231190608,-0.2662721893491125,-0.13945802378030292,-78.77604051612478,-0.09251150791293153,-0.7839075384444811,-0.5936716327052803,5.0986111111111105,1.2192891316042753,1.7852484535615631,1.1212639371311826,12.515000000000008,0.7419619960564549,1.1732955481596208,0.7973501400430039,45.611200586099976,0.5160987674612985,0.8051030450699328,0.5376524981691873,-3.304506088505494,-0.5277443355987148,-1.0132231347254304,-0.8471759038537052,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': -0.6908}",-0.6908,-0.33980726762697483,-0.42184455834307466,-0.41763971633307045,0.1260416666666667,-0.16826217285494688,0.23675165783399618,0.15688732526155047,-1.0,-0.11549549085279157,-0.04857150653532347,-0.16530229816483213,0.3943359336894021,-0.07771431398815144,0.4217213689081849,0.20217468482142426,38.368987360980455,-0.1430510225231601,0.21170779088188504,-0.24489656180332897

nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I
were separated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as my mother.
It is a common custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away,
to part children from their mothers at a very early age. Frequently,
before the child has reached its twelfth month, its mother is taken
from it, and hired out on some farm a considerable distance off, and
the child is placed under the care of an old woman, too old for field
labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know, unless it be to
hinder the development of the child’s affection toward its mother, and
to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for the child.

5,5,38,39,41,"I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves
invariably suffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with,
than others. They are, in the first place, a constant offence to their
mistress. She is ever disposed to find fault with them; they can seldom
do any thing to please her; she is never better pleased than when she
sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of
showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his
black slaves. The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of
his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and,
cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own
children to human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity
for him to do so; for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them
himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of
but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to

that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right. If the
lineal descendants of Ham are alone to be scripturally enslaved, it is
certain that slavery at the south must soon become unscriptural; for

7,7,46,59,72,"I have had two masters. My first master’s name was Anthony. I do not
remember his first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony—a
title which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the
Chesapeake Bay. He was not considered a rich slaveholder. He owned two
or three farms, and about thirty slaves. His farms and slaves were
under the care of an overseer. The overseer’s name was Plummer. Mr.
Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and a savage
monster. He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel. I have
known him to cut and slash the women’s heads so horribly, that even
master would be enraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him
if he did not mind himself. Master, however, was not a humane
slaveholder. It required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an
overseer to affect him. He was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of
slaveholding. He would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping
a slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most
heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to
a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered
with blood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim,
seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she
screamed, the harder he whipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there
he whipped longest. He would whip her to make her scream, and whip her
to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, would he cease to
swing the blood-clotted cowskin. I remember the first time I ever
witnessed this horrible exhibition. I was quite a child, but I well
remember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember any thing. It
was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomed
to be a witness and a participant. It struck me with awful force. It
was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery,
through which I was about to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle. I
wish I could commit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it.",i have had two masters my first master’s name was anthony i do not remember his first name he was generally called captain anthony—a title which i presume he acquired by sailing a craft on the chesapeake bay he was not considered a rich slaveholder he owned two or three farms and about thirty slaves his farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer the overseer’s name was plummer mr plummer was a miserable drunkard a profane swearer and a savage monster he always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel i have known him to cut and slash the women’s heads so horribly that even master would be enraged at his cruelty and would threaten to whip him if he did not mind himself master however was not a humane slaveholder it required extraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him he was a cruel man hardened by a long life of slaveholding he would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave i have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine whom he used to tie up to a joist and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood no words no tears no prayers from his gory victim seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose the louder she screamed the harder he whipped and where the blood ran fastest there he whipped longest he would whip her to make her scream and whip her to make her hush and not until overcome by fatigue would he cease to swing the blood clotted cowskin i remember the first time i ever witnessed this horrible exhibition i was quite a child but i well remember it i never shall forget it whilst i remember any thing it was the first of a long series of such outrages of which i was doomed to be a witness and a participant it struck me with awful force it was the blood stained gate the entrance to the hell of slavery through which i was about to pass it was a most terrible spectacle i wish i could commit to paper the feelings with which i beheld it,386,2055,-18.600000000000005,-1.325446605321224,-4.021447721179626,-1.2280355057329835,-20.60000000000001,-1.4231298743370575,-4.869822485207103,-1.4058937526969357,-186.89338622360856,-0.13446952561798636,-1.8597930714239683,-0.766263382270919,-1.6589833333333313,-0.24832842172480601,-0.6824072816193446,-0.3545055673002925,5.899000000000003,-0.18188666342668042,0.30124888786370985,-0.21601941332885177,-100.27678040025455,-1.2104371554638171,-2.2663193615330415,-1.0421270321759595,-7.926236632778314,-0.6937554533237968,-2.555860379548185,-1.1314667121814141,"{'neg': 0.174, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': -0.9929}",-0.9929,-0.2940589327430723,-0.6029433803914516,-0.33509615877726223,-0.1339506172839506,-0.24724423956587985,-1.150855275465062,-0.5245281419635618,-1.0,-0.0919051080384619,-0.04857150653532347,0.025516869460203446,-0.6062295102407563,-0.4430261409990937,-1.8213308234530166,-0.9650181508965366,62.253983553279674,-0.171831532262041,0.9311877914479995,-0.5841061628285448

9,9,79,85,92,"Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had
been found in company with Lloyd’s Ned; which circumstance, I found,
from what he said while whipping her, was the chief offence. Had he
been a man of pure morals himself, he might have been thought
interested in protecting the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew
him will not suspect him of any such virtue. Before he commenced
whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped her
from neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely
naked. He then told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same
time a d——d b—-h. After crossing her hands, he tied them with a strong
rope, and led her to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put in
for the purpose. He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to
the hook. She now stood fair for his infernal purpose. Her arms were
stretched up at their full length, so that she stood upon the ends of
her toes. He then said to her, “Now, you d——d b—-h, I’ll learn you how
to disobey my orders!” and after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced
to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid
heart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came
dripping to the floor. I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the
sight, that I hid myself in a closet, and dared not venture out till
long after the bloody transaction was over. I expected it would be my
turn next. It was all new to me. I had never seen any thing like it

10,10,93,99,105,"My master’s family consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; one
daughter, Lucretia, and her husband, Captain Thomas Auld. They lived in
one house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master
was Colonel Lloyd’s clerk and superintendent. He was what might be
called the overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of childhood on
this plantation in my old master’s family. It was here that I witnessed
the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter; and as I received
my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I will give some
description of it, and of slavery as it there existed. The plantation
is about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is
situated on the border of Miles River. The principal products raised
upon it were tobacco, corn, and wheat. These were raised in great
abundance; so that, with the products of this and the other farms
belonging to him, he was able to keep in almost constant employment a
large sloop, in carrying them to market at Baltimore. This sloop was
named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of the colonel’s daughters. My
master’s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of the vessel; she was
otherwise manned by the colonel’s own slaves. Their names were Peter,
Isaac, Rich, and Jake. These were esteemed very highly by the other

the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their

called by the slaves the _Great House Farm._ Few privileges were
esteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being
selected to do errands at the Great House Farm. It was associated in
their minds with greatness. A representative could not be prouder of
his election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of
the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House
Farm. They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them
by their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant
desire to be out of the field from under the driver’s lash, that they
esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for. He was
called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor
conferred upon him the most frequently. The competitors for this office
sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers
in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people. The
same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, as
are seen in the slaves of the political parties.",the home plantation of colonel lloyd wore the appearance of a country village all the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here the shoemaking and mending the blacksmithing cartwrighting coopering weaving and grain grinding were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation the whole place wore a business like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms the number of houses too conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms it was called by the slaves the great house farm few privileges were esteemed higher by the slaves of the out farms than that of being selected to do errands at the great house farm it was associated in their minds with greatness a representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the american congress than a slave on one of the out farms would be of his election to do errands at the great house farm they regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers and it was on this account as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver’s lash that they esteemed it a high privilege one worth careful living for he was called the smartest and most trusty fellow who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently the competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers as the office seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people the same traits of character might be seen in colonel lloyd’s slaves as are seen in the slaves of the political parties,271,1562,6.65,0.6063584406371189,1.3941018766756035,0.5775378300402444,6.65,0.6724854532972552,1.579881656804734,0.6542494234050927,121.17322055306539,0.22384319967923513,1.2058057301026743,0.7076341832765866,3.8555999999999995,0.7030628820721903,1.331340850427931,0.6021702844841568,13.253999999999996,0.5191457844948305,1.2707022110917048,0.5529430475214456,51.27508700481062,0.41478560825586835,0.9243465052732054,0.4449510067364606,2.1044808740321352,0.2853111661239205,0.7921838800801254,0.5451658198060242,"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.213, 'compound': 0.9953}",0.9953,0.10426734567345258,0.5889158648802565,0.3836025254897046,0.26894736842105266,-0.13555710038648136,0.9994548409792994,0.43904938007703576,0.9937,-0.02391789679688599,1.039484814582367,0.5754555101500252,0.9105295456305051,0.07929712954038055,1.5789162530322849,0.7038355084299314,49.45530053975517,-0.14334323618520295,0.5456572103384654,-0.24834061754156944

apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I
neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a
tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension;
they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and
complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone
was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance
from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my
spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found
myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs,
even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an
expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those
songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing
character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those
songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my
sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed
with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s

of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by
them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least, such
is my experience. I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to
express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike
uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast

22,22,187,192,197,"Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded
almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener,
(Mr. M’Durmond.) This garden was probably the greatest attraction of
the place. During the summer months, people came from far and near—from
Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis—to see it. It abounded in fruits of
almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the
delicate orange of the south. This garden was not the least source of
trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation
to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to
the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it.
Scarcely a day passed, during the summer, but that some slave had to
take the lash for stealing fruit. The colonel had to resort to all
kinds of stratagems to keep his slaves out of the garden. The last and
most successful one was that of tarring his fence all around; after
which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was
deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had
tried to get in. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chief

of the lash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching _tar_

24,24,202,210,218,"This establishment was under the care of two slaves—old Barney and
young Barney—father and son. To attend to this establishment was their
sole work. But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing
was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses.
The slightest inattention to these was unpardonable, and was visited
upon those, under whose care they were placed, with the severest
punishment; no excuse could shield them, if the colonel only suspected
any want of attention to his horses—a supposition which he frequently
indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old and young
Barney a very trying one. They never knew when they were safe from
punishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and
escaped whipping when most deserving it. Every thing depended upon the
looks of the horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd’s own mind when his
horses were brought to him for use. If a horse did not move fast
enough, or hold his head high enough, it was owing to some fault of his
keepers. It was painful to stand near the stable-door, and hear the
various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for
use. “This horse has not had proper attention. He has not been
sufficiently rubbed and curried, or he has not been properly fed; his
food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or too late; he was too
hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he
had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney’s
attending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.” To
all these complaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never
a word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave.
When he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and such was
literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man
between fifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down
upon the cold, damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn
shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time. Colonel Lloyd had three
sons—Edward, Murray, and Daniel,—and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr.
Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of these lived at the Great House Farm,
and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased, from
old Barney down to William Wilkes, the coach-driver. I have seen Winder
make one of the house-servants stand off from him a suitable distance
to be touched with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise great
ridges upon his back.",this establishment was under the care of two slaves—old barney and young barney—father and son to attend to this establishment was their sole work but it was by no means an easy employment for in nothing was colonel lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses the slightest inattention to these was unpardonable and was visited upon those under whose care they were placed with the severest punishment no excuse could shield them if the colonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses—a supposition which he frequently indulged and one which of course made the office of old and young barney a very trying one they never knew when they were safe from punishment they were frequently whipped when least deserving and escaped whipping when most deserving it every thing depended upon the looks of the horses and the state of colonel lloyd’s own mind when his horses were brought to him for use if a horse did not move fast enough or hold his head high enough it was owing to some fault of his keepers it was painful to stand near the stable door and hear the various complaints against the keepers when a horse was taken out for use “this horse has not had proper attention he has not been sufficiently rubbed and curried or he has not been properly fed his food was too wet or too dry he got it too soon or too late he was too hot or too cold he had too much hay and not enough of grain or he had too much grain and not enough of hay instead of old barney’s attending to the horse he had very improperly left it to his son” to all these complaints no matter how unjust the slave must answer never a word colonel lloyd could not brook any contradiction from a slave when he spoke a slave must stand listen and tremble and such was literally the case i have seen colonel lloyd make old barney a man between fifty and sixty years of age uncover his bald head kneel down upon the cold damp ground and receive upon his naked and toil worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the time colonel lloyd had three sons—edward murray and daniel—and three sons in law mr winder mr nicholson and mr lowndes all of these lived at the great house farm and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased from old barney down to william wilkes the coach driver i have seen winder make one of the house servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the end of his whip and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back,459,2530,-0.4500000000000006,-0.07150767169493184,-0.12868632707774805,-0.05603385474838885,-1.4500000000000002,-0.07255913662658757,-0.33727810650887585,-0.07818391375514215,84.16268399306229,0.12235952145772289,0.8375105172286175,0.290187255737468,-4.04375,-0.4800509906062872,-1.5532472218448585,-0.5875152501485957,-2.731999999999999,-0.624589378217134,-0.8363923946353836,-0.7016200014324269,-12.399986198520814,-0.36787802318158863,-0.416223466677325,-0.27118583563847803,-0.4816143551314929,-0.0196494306238708,-0.07100076059735058,0.022926732776304953,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.6531}",-0.6531,-0.2207459224291514,-0.3992446722417049,-0.20281775560053716,0.13032494758909852,-0.19463337278986798,0.25961199128282614,-0.07062942978499327,-1.0,-0.08742847196518412,-0.04857150653532347,0.06172772606165663,1.1129119307455282,-0.019781264732274068,2.0326139650424433,0.3872741944541371,71.76053891459244,-0.17846430865650778,1.2175506780765655,-0.6622806446174149

27,27,231,239,247,"It is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired
of as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost
universally say they are contented, and that their masters are kind.
The slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves,
to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition. The
frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the
maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They suppress the truth
rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing prove
themselves a part of the human family. If they have any thing to say of
their masters, it is generally in their masters’ favor, especially when
speaking to an untried man. I have been frequently asked, when a slave,
if I had a kind master, and do not remember ever to have given a
negative answer; nor did I, in pursuing this course, consider myself as
uttering what was absolutely false; for I always measured the kindness
of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders
around us. Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibe
prejudices quite common to others. They think their own better than
that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think
their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and
this, too, in some cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is
not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves
about the relative goodness of their masters, each contending for the
superior goodness of his own over that of the others. At the very same
time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately. It
was so on our plantation. When Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met the slaves of
Jacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters;
Colonel Lloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr.
Jepson’s slaves that he was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel
Lloyd’s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson.
Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast his ability to whip Colonel Lloyd.
These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties,
and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue.
They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was
transferable to themselves. It was considered as being bad enough to be
a slave; but to be a poor man’s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!",it is partly in consequence of such facts that slaves when inquired of as to their condition and the character of their masters almost universally say they are contented and that their masters are kind the slaveholders have been known to send in spies among their slaves to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition the frequency of this has had the effect to establish among the slaves the maxim that a still tongue makes a wise head they suppress the truth rather than take the consequences of telling it and in so doing prove themselves a part of the human family if they have any thing to say of their masters it is generally in their masters’ favor especially when speaking to an untried man i have been frequently asked when a slave if i had a kind master and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer nor did i in pursuing this course consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false for i always measured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up among slaveholders around us moreover slaves are like other people and imbibe prejudices quite common to others they think their own better than that of others many under the influence of this prejudice think their own masters are better than the masters of other slaves and this too in some cases when the very reverse is true indeed it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters each contending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others at the very same time they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately it was so on our plantation when colonel lloyd’s slaves met the slaves of jacob jepson they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters colonel lloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest and mr jepson’s slaves that he was the smartest and most of a man colonel lloyd’s slaves would boast his ability to buy and sell jacob jepson mr jepson’s slaves would boast his ability to whip colonel lloyd these quarrels would almost always end in a fight between the parties and those that whipped were supposed to have gained the point at issue they seemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable to themselves it was considered as being bad enough to be a slave but to be a poor man’s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed,425,2427,-10.649999999999999,-0.711104234753504,-2.3163538873994636,-0.6538366725466299,-12.15,-0.7565806972811563,-2.869822485207101,-0.7506271488788134,-28.360390121173687,0.026139609852433538,-0.28221681952476096,-0.10560748851727039,2.7988611111111106,0.31060833990044934,0.9454538604356291,0.20753583499907025,12.954999999999997,0.13500719433597372,1.2312913961841359,0.1315814451135773,49.83774956525516,0.15437695001440144,0.8940858190408493,0.20667721100938644,-3.9011138071972993,-0.3009096754926915,-1.2123583457868365,-0.45872596289809786,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.901}",0.901,0.005231102873985443,0.5323861763030903,0.20491178563273796,0.14032258064516126,-0.1907778757099671,0.31297043998127866,-0.03736624165266687,-0.6716,-0.08092671660575299,0.13065189510737582,0.11431947735085747,0.981509811914511,-0.03198644669700142,1.73803872010185,0.3482779181374737,70.54514134681783,-0.16550750115335994,1.1809396509819716,-0.5095705799389636

29,29,252,259,266,"Mr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. He was artful, cruel,
and obdurate. He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the
place for such a man. It afforded scope for the full exercise of all
his powers, and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it. He was one of
those who could torture the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the
part of the slave, into impudence, and would treat it accordingly.
There must be no answering back to him; no explanation was allowed a
slave, showing himself to have been wrongfully accused. Mr. Gore acted
fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,—“It is better that a
dozen slaves should suffer under the lash, than that the overseer
should be convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at
fault.” No matter how innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing,
when accused by Mr. Gore of any misdemeanor. To be accused was to be
convicted, and to be convicted was to be punished; the one always
following the other with immutable certainty. To escape punishment was
to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to do either,
under the overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough to demand
the most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to
crouch, himself, at the feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to
be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and
persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition. He was cruel
enough to inflict the severest punishment, artful enough to descend to
the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice
of a reproving conscience. He was, of all the overseers, the most
dreaded by the slaves. His presence was painful; his eye flashed
confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, without
producing horror and trembling in their ranks.",mr gore was proud ambitious and persevering he was artful cruel and obdurate he was just the man for such a place and it was just the place for such a man it afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers and he seemed to be perfectly at home in it he was one of those who could torture the slightest look word or gesture on the part of the slave into impudence and would treat it accordingly there must be no answering back to him no explanation was allowed a slave showing himself to have been wrongfully accused mr gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders—“it is better that a dozen slaves should suffer under the lash than that the overseer should be convicted in the presence of the slaves of having been at fault” no matter how innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing when accused by mr gore of any misdemeanor to be accused was to be convicted and to be convicted was to be punished the one always following the other with immutable certainty to escape punishment was to escape accusation and few slaves had the fortune to do either under the overseership of mr gore he was just proud enough to demand the most debasing homage of the slave and quite servile enough to crouch himself at the feet of the master he was ambitious enough to be contented with nothing short of the highest rank of overseers and persevering enough to reach the height of his ambition he was cruel enough to inflict the severest punishment artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery and obdurate enough to be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience he was of all the overseers the most dreaded by the slaves his presence was painful his eye flashed confusion and seldom was his sharp shrill voice heard without producing horror and trembling in their ranks,326,1841,-17.1,-1.4388033359140877,-3.699731903485255,-1.3339850634366015,-19.1,-1.5635720868102172,-4.514792899408285,-1.543958721896159,-58.93709268364541,-0.01774308218460966,-0.5864883655742219,-0.28611626868804935,0.39791666666666803,0.035082485936282326,0.0687063170764846,-0.06952044035033182,-1.0750000000000002,-0.5692470134805436,-0.6179853033248756,-0.6409149640218219,-101.3498701707203,-1.3954220721537114,-2.2889114348691804,-1.2113881410408065,-9.172913421409651,-0.9568062728810164,-2.9719750854956986,-1.58193612138707,"{'neg': 0.157, 'neu': 0.744, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': -0.9694}",-0.9694,-0.3196577930116251,-0.5888559182327728,-0.38128409110972156,0.030465949820788527,-0.21051603466429028,-0.27334627790150495,-0.20765662991572678,-0.8739,-0.09288297002814987,0.020247223510792164,0.0176070863764346,0.1629224018144991,-0.22370079677338534,-0.09705792050557416,-0.26426073888984963,55.37721806258419,-0.16029632039718358,0.724041212930486,-0.44815114848307025

32,32,284,289,295,"A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation,
excepting Mr. Gore. He alone seemed cool and collected. He was asked by
Colonel Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this extraordinary
expedient. His reply was, (as well as I can remember,) that Demby had
become unmanageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the other
slaves,—one which, if suffered to pass without some such demonstration
on his part, would finally lead to the total subversion of all rule and
order upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refused to be
corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy
the example; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves,
and the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore’s defence was satisfactory.
He was continued in his station as overseer upon the home plantation.
His fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime was not even
submitted to judicial investigation. It was committed in the presence
of slaves, and they of course could neither institute a suit, nor
testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator of one of the
bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, and
uncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St.
Michael’s, Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is

had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours before she was taken
up and examined by the coroner, who decided that she had come to her
death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl was thus
murdered was this:—She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hicks’s
baby, and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She,
having lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear the
crying. They were both in the room with Mrs. Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding
the girl slow to move, jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood
by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl’s nose and breastbone, and
thus ended her life. I will not say that this most horrid murder
produced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation, but
not enough to bring the murderess to punishment. There was a warrant

38,38,318,321,324,"As to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, it
was very similar to that of the other slave children. I was not old
enough to work in the field, and there being little else than field
work to do, I had a great deal of leisure time. The most I had to do
was to drive up the cows at evening, keep the fowls out of the garden,
keep the front yard clean, and run of errands for my old master’s
daughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld. The most of my leisure time I spent in
helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds, after he had shot
them. My connection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me. He

43,43,350,356,363,"The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all
suspended in my case. I found no severe trial in my departure. My home
was charmless; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I could not
feel that I was leaving any thing which I could have enjoyed by
staying. My mother was dead, my grandmother lived far off, so that I
seldom saw her. I had two sisters and one brother, that lived in the
same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother had
well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. I
looked for home elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I
should relish less than the one which I was leaving. If, however, I
found in my new home hardship, hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had
the consolation that I should not have escaped any one of them by
staying. Having already had more than a taste of them in the house of
my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturally inferred
my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for I
had something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the
proverb, that “being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural
death in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin
Tom, though not fluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by
his eloquent description of the place. I could never point out any
thing at the Great House, no matter how beautiful or powerful, but that
he had seen something at Baltimore far exceeding, both in beauty and
strength, the object which I pointed out to him. Even the Great House
itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to many buildings in
Baltimore. So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratification of
it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should
sustain by the exchange. I left without a regret, and with the highest
hopes of future happiness.",the ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in my case i found no severe trial in my departure my home was charmless it was not home to me on parting from it i could not feel that i was leaving any thing which i could have enjoyed by staying my mother was dead my grandmother lived far off so that i seldom saw her i had two sisters and one brother that lived in the same house with me but the early separation of us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories i looked for home elsewhere and was confident of finding none which i should relish less than the one which i was leaving if however i found in my new home hardship hunger whipping and nakedness i had the consolation that i should not have escaped any one of them by staying having already had more than a taste of them in the house of my old master and having endured them there i very naturally inferred my ability to endure them elsewhere and especially at baltimore for i had something of the feeling about baltimore that is expressed in the proverb that “being hanged in england is preferable to dying a natural death in ireland” i had the strongest desire to see baltimore cousin tom though not fluent in speech had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent description of the place i could never point out any thing at the great house no matter how beautiful or powerful but that he had seen something at baltimore far exceeding both in beauty and strength the object which i pointed out to him even the great house itself with all its pictures was far inferior to many buildings in baltimore so strong was my desire that i thought a gratification of it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts i should sustain by the exchange i left without a regret and with the highest hopes of future happiness,345,1894,14.1,1.0401548152242481,2.991957104557641,0.982988249971752,13.35,1.0532930208622662,3.1656804733727815,1.028611121080158,146.12311092937816,0.2147678164983557,1.4540843567156931,0.6703031474736761,-1.4235666666666662,-0.23951541446123703,-0.5964407009917131,-0.34564360777111813,9.323000000000002,0.06288941852711409,0.7525620324908556,0.052475460046193224,69.42890877482763,0.45835345843182573,1.30654423378329,0.4848155684726063,2.691996370743296,0.2866007690270599,0.9882842971112048,0.5473742396804232,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.701, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969,0.054316667140369,0.5898750112399964,0.2934766942674176,0.2453212121212121,-0.15901687358232056,0.8733594900299886,0.23665087394849052,-0.997,-0.09515570893995384,-0.046934264741997966,-0.000776767365694118,1.0767886692191364,0.054003100457327535,1.9516333940527602,0.6230195935066597,58.8874206100096,-0.15919583915521388,0.8297779068146183,-0.43518078046627384

remember only the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge
of the days of the month, nor the months of the year. On setting sail,
I walked aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would
be the last look. I then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and

50,50,391,397,403,"My new mistress proved to be all she appeared when I first met her at
the door,—a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings. She had
never had a slave under her control previously to myself, and prior to
her marriage she had been dependent upon her own industry for a living.
She was by trade a weaver; and by constant application to her business,
she had been in a good degree preserved from the blighting and
dehumanizing effects of slavery. I was utterly astonished at her
goodness. I scarcely knew how to behave towards her. She was entirely
unlike any other white woman I had ever seen. I could not approach her
as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies. My early
instruction was all out of place. The crouching servility, usually so
acceptable a quality in a slave, did not answer when manifested toward
her. Her favor was not gained by it; she seemed to be disturbed by it.
She did not deem it impudent or unmannerly for a slave to look her in

52,52,407,415,424,"Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly
commenced to teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she
assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just
at this point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and
at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among
other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slave
to read. To use his own words, further, he said, “If you give a nigger
an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey
his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would _spoil_ the best
nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach that nigger (speaking
of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever
unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of
no value to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a
great deal of harm. It would make him discontented and unhappy.” These
words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay
slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought.
It was a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious
things, with which my youthful understanding had struggled, but
struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a most
perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the
black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From
that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom. It was
just what I wanted, and I got it at a time when I the least expected
it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind
mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which, by the
merest accident, I had gained from my master. Though conscious of the
difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with high hope, and
a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read. The
very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife
with the evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince
me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave
me the best assurance that I might rely with the utmost confidence on
the results which, he said, would flow from teaching me to read. What
he most dreaded, that I most desired. What he most loved, that I most
hated. That which to him was a great evil, to be carefully shunned, was
to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and the argument which he
so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served to inspire me
with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owe
almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly
aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.",very soon after i went to live with mr and mrs auld she very kindly commenced to teach me the a b c after i had learned this she assisted me in learning to spell words of three or four letters just at this point of my progress mr auld found out what was going on and at once forbade mrs auld to instruct me further telling her among other things that it was unlawful as well as unsafe to teach a slave to read to use his own words further he said “if you give a nigger an inch he will take an ell a nigger should know nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do learning would spoil the best nigger in the world now” said he “if you teach that nigger speaking of myself how to read there would be no keeping him it would forever unfit him to be a slave he would at once become unmanageable and of no value to his master as to himself it could do him no good but a great deal of harm it would make him discontented and unhappy” these words sank deep into my heart stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering and called into existence an entirely new train of thought it was a new and special revelation explaining dark and mysterious things with which my youthful understanding had struggled but struggled in vain i now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit the white man’s power to enslave the black man it was a grand achievement and i prized it highly from that moment i understood the pathway from slavery to freedom it was just what i wanted and i got it at a time when i the least expected it whilst i was saddened by the thought of losing the aid of my kind mistress i was gladdened by the invaluable instruction which by the merest accident i had gained from my master though conscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher i set out with high hope and a fixed purpose at whatever cost of trouble to learn how to read the very decided manner with which he spoke and strove to impress his wife with the evil consequences of giving me instruction served to convince me that he was deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering it gave me the best assurance that i might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which he said would flow from teaching me to read what he most dreaded that i most desired what he most loved that i most hated that which to him was a great evil to be carefully shunned was to me a great good to be diligently sought and the argument which he so warmly urged against my learning to read only served to inspire me with a desire and determination to learn in learning to read i owe almost as much to the bitter opposition of my master as to the kindly aid of my mistress i acknowledge the benefit of both,524,2783,15.450000000000005,0.7377389494698382,3.281501340482575,0.7003334216994413,11.450000000000003,0.6001915145833709,2.7159763313609475,0.5831791928379797,41.313825456518494,0.08214743677187457,0.41111763177174626,0.12477729527653668,10.366016666666665,0.9883575881223526,3.7087352261920934,0.8890496734704267,22.747000000000003,0.4045333077901165,2.521962632220647,0.4272246269371936,92.24246023175509,0.3671076284427958,1.7868446166198368,0.40132567837996047,-2.515133367136936,-0.1494057465406711,-0.7497469869133933,-0.19927843301687354,"{'neg': 0.158, 'neu': 0.642, 'pos': 0.201, 'compound': 0.9814}",0.9814,-0.010529751678981816,0.5805832808800168,0.17647453194420332,0.17907279795034894,-0.1898130345931111,0.519784539932555,-0.029042103176439613,0.9894,-0.04324258581376398,1.037138101345267,0.4191409178080394,1.5697329431495344,0.04071277336482911,3.0567082705229693,0.5805562144979975,85.04294697631765,-0.17046709196747764,1.6176523520659676,-0.568024750367795
53,53,425,436,448,"I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before I observed a marked
difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessed
in the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave
on the plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys
privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation. There is
a vestige of decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb and
check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the
plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity
of his non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated
slave. Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation
of being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known
as not giving a slave enough to eat. Every city slaveholder is anxious
to have it known of him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due
to them to say, that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat.
There are, however, some painful exceptions to this rule. Directly
opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr. Thomas Hamilton. He owned
two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary. Henrietta was about
twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of all the
mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the
most so. His heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon
these unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut
to pieces. I have frequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered
with festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do
not know that her master ever whipped her, but I have been an
eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton. I used to be in Mr.
Hamilton’s house nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a large
chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by her
side, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the
blood of one of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without her
saying, “Move faster, you _black gip!_” at the same time giving them a
blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the
blood. She would then say, “Take that, you _black gip!_” continuing,
“If you don’t move faster, I’ll move you!” Added to the cruel lashings
to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly
half-starved. They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal. I have
seen Mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the
street. So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener
called “_pecked_” than by her name.",i had resided but a short time in baltimore before i observed a marked difference in the treatment of slaves from that which i had witnessed in the country a city slave is almost a freeman compared with a slave on the plantation he is much better fed and clothed and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the slave on the plantation there is a vestige of decency a sense of shame that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so commonly enacted upon the plantation he is a desperate slaveholder who will shock the humanity of his non slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his lacerated slave few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputation of being a cruel master and above all things they would not be known as not giving a slave enough to eat every city slaveholder is anxious to have it known of him that he feeds his slaves well and it is due to them to say that most of them do give their slaves enough to eat there are however some painful exceptions to this rule directly opposite to us on philpot street lived mr thomas hamilton he owned two slaves their names were henrietta and mary henrietta was about twenty two years of age mary was about fourteen and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures i ever looked upon these two were the most so his heart must be harder than stone that could look upon these unmoved the head neck and shoulders of mary were literally cut to pieces i have frequently felt her head and found it nearly covered with festering sores caused by the lash of her cruel mistress i do not know that her master ever whipped her but i have been an eye witness to the cruelty of mrs hamilton i used to be in mr hamilton’s house nearly every day mrs hamilton used to sit in a large chair in the middle of the room with a heavy cowskin always by her side and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood of one of these slaves the girls seldom passed her without her saying “move faster you black gip” at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders often drawing the blood she would then say “take that you black gip” continuing “if you do not move faster I will move you” added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected they were kept nearly half starved they seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal i have seen mary contending with the pigs for the offal thrown into the street so much was mary kicked and cut to pieces that she was oftener called “pecked” than by her name,478,2589,-17.550000000000004,-1.0207406080415364,-3.7962466487935664,-0.9432401921016008,-19.549999999999997,-1.0877444117200878,-4.621301775147929,-1.0761853071330454,-265.0074140552043,-0.16148939366685996,-2.6371128614801314,-0.8774079633226107,-2.663149999999998,-0.31373412829170333,-1.0490965901372091,-0.4202745729572977,3.81,-0.33432275761467367,0.025900418492766853,-0.3832265582431068,-80.39773013136059,-0.8789131479762342,-1.847799891971127,-0.7387827264521853,-10.686468882793802,-0.7568012497717931,-3.477168325229117,-1.2394314116514007,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': -0.9934}",-0.9934,-0.26254751563838724,-0.6032431136288703,-0.27824022122136033,-0.09890873015873013,-0.23556226259206553,-0.9638329346786924,-0.4237422277780217,-0.9992,-0.08646939121270124,-0.04813490872376999,0.0694855904555657,-0.5114746579579402,-0.3900025507697447,-1.6089108558844902,-0.7956046524447409,74.48628310842844,-0.1791519332833782,1.299657387172734,-0.6703850485161659

55,55,457,464,472,"My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and
in the simplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live
with her, to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat
another. In entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, she did not seem
to perceive that I sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and
that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong, but
dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me.
When I went there, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman.
There was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear. She had
bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every
mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to
divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under its influence, the tender
heart became stone, and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of
tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was in her
ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband’s
precepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than
her husband himself. She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as
he had commanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to
make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to
think that here lay the danger. I have had her rush at me with a face
made all up of fury, and snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that
fully revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman; and a little

slavery were incompatible with each other.",my mistress was as i have said a kind and tender hearted woman and in the simplicity of her soul she commenced when i first went to live with her to treat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder she did not seem to perceive that i sustained to her the relation of a mere chattel and that for her to treat me as a human being was not only wrong but dangerously so slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me when i went there she was a pious warm and tender hearted woman there was no sorrow or suffering for which she had not a tear she had bread for the hungry clothes for the naked and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities under its influence the tender heart became stone and the lamblike disposition gave way to one of tiger like fierceness the first step in her downward course was in her ceasing to instruct me she now commenced to practise her husband’s precepts she finally became even more violent in her opposition than her husband himself she was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he had commanded she seemed anxious to do better nothing seemed to make her more angry than to see me with a newspaper she seemed to think that here lay the danger i have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury and snatch from me a newspaper in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension she was an apt woman and a little experience soon demonstrated to her satisfaction that education and slavery were incompatible with each other,304,1643,-1.7499999999999996,-0.19837775756007214,-0.40750670241286846,-0.17461375214777525,-1.7499999999999996,-0.1424304702554385,-0.40828402366863903,-0.14687254629302368,-59.55014893213248,-0.023552650934892425,-0.5925889440182621,-0.3100135757982555,-1.4277333333333333,-0.26879952995903245,-0.5979622333922023,-0.37509038327326777,2.7200000000000015,-0.31396109548815687,-0.11777111411342131,-0.3608918519649151,-19.087578497628954,-0.4973657625199,-0.5570193067104219,-0.3896670541993761,-0.17190910054601558,-0.0029125833056889436,0.032372392827378436,0.05158825808946463,"{'neg': 0.202, 'neu': 0.695, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.9943}",-0.9943,-0.33860812980418,-0.6037826334562238,-0.4154761162338669,0.008954545454545451,-0.21585238488024527,-0.38815496910584885,-0.25369583510632016,-0.9992,-0.09946896500089487,-0.04813490872376999,-0.035666066864575324,0.17004695753863955,-0.21738653138662492,-0.08108620128063132,-0.24408628852356595,53.80754847090287,-0.15072093472371162,0.6767585644586557,-0.33529481677004863

was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in
the street. As many of these as I could, I converted into teachers.
With their kindly aid, obtained at different times and in different
places, I finally succeeded in learning to read. When I was sent of
errands, I always took my book with me, and by going one part of my
errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. I used
also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house,
and to which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this
regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This
bread I used to bestow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return,
would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly
tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, as a
testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence
forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for
it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this
Christian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that
they lived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard.
I used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes
say to them, I wished I could be as free as they would be when they got
to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, _but I am a
slave for life!_ Have not I as good a right to be free as you have?”

life_ began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time, I got
hold of a book entitled “The Columbian Orator.” Every opportunity I
got, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter,
I found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was
represented as having run away from his master three times. The
dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them,
when the slave was retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole
argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master, all of
which was disposed of by the slave. The slave was made to say some very
smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master—things which
had the desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted
in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.",i was now about twelve years old and the thought of being a slave for life began to bear heavily upon my heart just about this time i got hold of a book entitled “the columbian orator” every opportunity i got i used to read this book among much of other interesting matter i found in it a dialogue between a master and his slave the slave was represented as having run away from his master three times the dialogue represented the conversation which took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time in this dialogue the whole argument in behalf of slavery was brought forward by the master all of which was disposed of by the slave the slave was made to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the desired though unexpected effect for the conversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master,164,913,2.3000000000000003,0.3270651050978447,0.4611260053619305,0.31649461526868866,-1.7000000000000002,-0.2664156541289194,-0.3964497041420119,-0.2687590524310811,0.0,0.05181337979882846,0.0,0.0,7.7931,2.412806972722279,2.769188968890097,2.3214112295381537,6.917999999999999,0.37894452540712037,0.435561999538669,0.3991562926828647,19.867725415583575,0.16841919558601484,0.26311811986936373,0.2195258588825977,-2.3077515868078193,-0.47017338777163825,-0.6805272746933072,-0.7485867760998888,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.8464}",0.8464,0.1991951755112352,0.4996553067769685,0.5548804704848157,0.20595238095238097,-0.11359557296857763,0.663243780995615,0.6285218146388993,0.9579,-0.0002967356260125033,1.0199470625153493,0.766523639414335,0.4284428458569163,0.00011525267304286316,0.4981817189793529,0.45084474118742973,32.50083484754345,-0.12227941094232922,0.03494333424567567,-8.053384167955447e-05
59,59,498,510,523,"In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and
in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to me.
I read them over and over again with unabated interest. They gave
tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently
flashed through my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral
which I gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the
conscience of even a slaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold
denunciation of slavery, and a powerful vindication of human rights.
The reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts, and to
meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they
relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on another even more
painful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, the more
I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no
other light than a band of successful robbers, who had left their
homes, and gone to Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a
strange land reduced us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest
as well as the most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the
subject, behold! that very discontentment which Master Hugh had
predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, to torment
and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I
would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than
a blessing. It had given me a view of my wretched condition, without
the remedy. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder
upon which to get out. In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves
for their stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred
the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing, no matter
what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my
condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was
pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or
inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal
wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was
heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to
torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without
seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and felt nothing without
feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled in every calm,
breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.",in the same book i met with one of sheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalf of catholic emancipation these were choice documents to me i read them over and over again with unabated interest they gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul which had frequently flashed through my mind and died away for want of utterance the moral which i gained from the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even a slaveholder what i got from sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery and a powerful vindication of human rights the reading of these documents enabled me to utter my thoughts and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustain slavery but while they relieved me of one difficulty they brought on another even more painful than the one of which i was relieved the more i read the more i was led to abhor and detest my enslavers i could regard them in no other light than a band of successful robbers who had left their homes and gone to africa and stolen us from our homes and in a strange land reduced us to slavery i loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men as i read and contemplated the subject behold that very discontentment which master hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come to torment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish as i writhed under it i would at times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing it had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy it opened my eyes to the horrible pit but to no ladder upon which to get out in moments of agony i envied my fellow slaves for their stupidity i have often wished myself a beast i preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own any thing no matter what to get rid of thinking it was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me there was no getting rid of it it was pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing animate or inanimate the silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness freedom now appeared to disappear no more forever it was heard in every sound and seen in every thing it was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition i saw nothing without seeing it i heard nothing without hearing it and felt nothing without feeling it it looked from every star it smiled in every calm breathed in every wind and moved in every storm,450,2461,0.14999999999999925,-0.03661111654434199,-7.143526163807979e-17,-0.023417577230080918,-0.8500000000000008,-0.03839322077141167,-0.19526627218934933,-0.044596318991853956,-70.33093083045782,-0.0083178694133747,-0.6998694844599103,-0.2473462301783448,-2.642614285714285,-0.32919415117646694,-1.0415976090205135,-0.4358204692702665,5.816999999999996,-0.23099940464672702,0.29044057073186724,-0.2698911769820789,24.830458278384693,-0.07035874701479805,0.36759998883304473,0.0010441574537572826,-2.254701525972521,-0.15669082255341832,-0.6628202710286182,-0.21175398391234107,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': -0.9875}",-0.9875,-0.2699592712042599,-0.5997062614273296,-0.29161322536880663,0.15416666666666667,-0.18974210806772596,0.38685782408640945,-0.028430186656062235,-0.8503,-0.08428747497362925,0.033126858951619556,0.08713479283791785,0.8729286720988617,-0.07114067788248198,1.4946231942208952,0.2231778399339591,71.98939872212263,-0.17358190022476921,1.2244445478986785,-0.6047361524872144
60,60,524,538,553,"I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself
dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I
should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have
been killed. While in this state of mind, I was eager to hear any one
speak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while, I could
hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I found
what the word meant. It was always used in such connections as to make
it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and succeeded in
getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn, or
did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of
as the fruit of _abolition._ Hearing the word in this connection very
often, I set about learning what it meant. The dictionary afforded me
little or no help. I found it was “the act of abolishing;” but then I
did not know what was to be abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not
dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was
something they wanted me to know very little about. After a patient
waiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the
number of petitions from the north, praying for the abolition of
slavery in the District of Columbia, and of the slave trade between the
States. From this time I understood the words _abolition_ and
_abolitionist,_ and always drew near when that word was spoken,
expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves.
The light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf
of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I
went, unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came
to me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are
ye a slave for life?” I told him that I was. The good Irishman seemed
to be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other that it
was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for
life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised me to run
away to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should
be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, and
treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might
be treacherous. White men have been known to encourage slaves to
escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return them to
their masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me
so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and from that time I
resolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at which it would be
safe for me to escape. I was too young to think of doing so
immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might have
occasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the hope that I
should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.",i often found myself regretting my own existence and wishing myself dead and but for the hope of being free i have no doubt but that i should have killed myself or done something for which i should have been killed while in this state of mind i was eager to hear any one speak of slavery i was a ready listener every little while i could hear something about the abolitionists it was some time before i found what the word meant it was always used in such connections as to make it an interesting word to me if a slave ran away and succeeded in getting clear or if a slave killed his master set fire to a barn or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder it was spoken of as the fruit of abolition hearing the word in this connection very often i set about learning what it meant the dictionary afforded me little or no help i found it was “the act of abolishing” but then i did not know what was to be abolished here i was perplexed i did not dare to ask any one about its meaning for i was satisfied that it was something they wanted me to know very little about after a patient waiting i got one of our city papers containing an account of the number of petitions from the north praying for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and of the slave trade between the states from this time i understood the words abolition and abolitionist and always drew near when that word was spoken expecting to hear something of importance to myself and fellow slaves the light broke in upon me by degrees i went one day down on the wharf of mr waters and seeing two irishmen unloading a scow of stone i went unasked and helped them when we had finished one of them came to me and asked me if i were a slave i told him i was he asked “are ye a slave for life” i told him that i was the good irishman seemed to be deeply affected by the statement he said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life he said it was a shame to hold me they both advised me to run away to the north that i should find friends there and that i should be free i pretended not to be interested in what they said and treated them as if i did not understand them for i feared they might be treacherous white men have been known to encourage slaves to escape and then to get the reward catch them and return them to their masters i was afraid that these seemingly good men might use me so but i nevertheless remembered their advice and from that time i resolved to run away i looked forward to a time at which it would be safe for me to escape i was too young to think of doing so immediately besides i wished to learn how to write as i might have occasion to write my own pass i consoled myself with the hope that i should one day find a good chance meanwhile i would learn to write,565,2896,6.45,0.25777642551258895,1.3512064343163541,0.25173352946874494,4.45,0.22427602478855993,1.0591715976331364,0.21362676550100412,0.0,0.05181337979882846,0.0,0.0,5.816071428571429,0.5010580324279622,2.047241842141014,0.39904338934993655,20.505,0.2561293244553234,2.2264474247866333,0.2644403042379313,61.211401557248834,0.12206541886792324,1.1335386467304818,0.17711217571441573,-2.951765480936203,-0.16409147898858273,-0.8954856782066597,-0.22442746403186367,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.736, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.8569}",0.8569,-0.03325349127065068,0.5059497047627611,0.13547416960034633,0.12942460317460316,-0.19920794976145775,0.2548067557853445,-0.1100964586215732,-0.9463,-0.08195489095950406,-0.019264878434796847,0.1060027248886205,0.809240922734988,-0.12491056022603202,1.351848979196976,0.051379894156229226,90.72794951930224,-0.17277071679305328,1.7888998414904649,-0.5951754737248471
61,61,554,564,575,"The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being
in Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship
carpenters, after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready for use,
write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was
intended. When a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side, it
would be marked thus—“L.” When a piece was for the starboard side, it
would be marked thus—“S.” A piece for the larboard side forward, would
be marked thus—“L. F.” When a piece was for starboard side forward, it
would be marked thus—“S. F.” For larboard aft, it would be marked
thus—“L. A.” For starboard aft, it would be marked thus—“S. A.” I soon
learned the names of these letters, and for what they were intended
when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard. I immediately
commenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four
letters named. After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could
write, I would tell him I could write as well as he. The next word
would be, “I don’t believe you. Let me see you try it.” I would then
make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask him
to beat that. In this way I got a good many lessons in writing, which
it is quite possible I should never have gotten in any other way.
During this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, and
pavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk. With these, I learned
mainly how to write. I then commenced and continued copying the Italics
in Webster’s Spelling Book, until I could make them all without looking
on the book. By this time, my little Master Thomas had gone to school,
and learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.
These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near neighbors,
and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to class meeting at the
Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take
care of the house. When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing
in the spaces left in Master Thomas’s copy-book, copying what he had
written. I continued to do this until I could write a hand very similar
to that of Master Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years,
I finally succeeded in learning how to write.",the idea as to how i might learn to write was suggested to me by being in durgin and bailey’s ship yard and frequently seeing the ship carpenters after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready for use write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended when a piece of timber was intended for the larboard side it would be marked thus—“l” when a piece was for the starboard side it would be marked thus—“s” a piece for the larboard side forward would be marked thus—“l f” when a piece was for starboard side forward it would be marked thus—“s f” for larboard aft it would be marked thus—“l a” for starboard aft it would be marked thus—“s a” i soon learned the names of these letters and for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship yard i immediately commenced copying them and in a short time was able to make the four letters named after that when i met with any boy who i knew could write i would tell him i could write as well as he the next word would be “i do not believe you let me see you try it” i would then make the letters which i had been so fortunate as to learn and ask him to beat that in this way i got a good many lessons in writing which it is quite possible i should never have gotten in any other way during this time my copy book was the board fence brick wall and pavement my pen and ink was a lump of chalk with these i learned mainly how to write i then commenced and continued copying the italics in webster’s spelling book until i could make them all without looking on the book by this time my little master thomas had gone to school and learned how to write and had written over a number of copy books these had been brought home and shown to some of our near neighbors and then laid aside my mistress used to go to class meeting at the wilk street meetinghouse every monday afternoon and leave me to take care of the house when left thus i used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in master thomas’s copy book copying what he had written i continued to do this until i could write a hand very similar to that of master thomas thus after a long tedious effort for years i finally succeeded in learning how to write,438,2275,10.100000000000001,0.5670614728517444,2.1340482573726547,0.5408086800887736,7.1000000000000005,0.4484512111261601,1.686390532544379,0.4340073736664155,84.71921125184589,0.1262307241886829,0.8430485705586906,0.30611121232084043,8.547266666666665,0.9745854305372383,3.044586333378617,0.8752010177847319,43.537000000000006,1.5718149664259626,5.262266451379047,1.707615826219504,93.27071148323826,0.5007172643605816,1.8084926914788504,0.5235784303077525,1.4557879833232845,0.1316388653155111,0.5756637251136574,0.2820049953198642,"{'neg': 0.003, 'neu': 0.946, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': 0.9614}",0.9614,0.01001340924883837,0.5685939513832688,0.21354048397780237,0.09616666666666668,-0.20000104629866974,0.0773055523480993,-0.1169388757671875,-0.8209,-0.08412064709626645,0.04917182852620955,0.08848423921806253,0.427457828580515,-0.173256067586145,0.4959735224293432,-0.10308685358523825,72.62764494579497,-0.1657385365310705,1.2436702320759758,-0.5122935830757024

youngest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months
after his death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his
son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate. He died while
on a visit to see his daughter at Hillsborough. Cut off thus
unexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal of his property. It
was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property, that it
might be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew. I was
immediately sent for, to be valued with the other property. Here again
my feelings rose up in detestation of slavery. I had now a new
conception of my degraded condition. Prior to this, I had become, if
not insensible to my lot, at least partly so. I left Baltimore with a
young heart overborne with sadness, and a soul full of apprehension. I
took passage with Captain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a
sail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near the place of my
birth. I had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, five years.
I, however, remembered the place very well. I was only about five years
old when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel

it was to be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind. They
had seen little or nothing of the world. They were in very deed men and
women of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. Their backs had been made
familiar with the bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine
was yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whippings, and few
slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistress than myself; and the
thought of passing out of their hands into those of Master Andrew—a man
who, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his bloody
disposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him on the
ground, and with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the
blood gushed from his nose and ears—was well calculated to make me
anxious as to my fate. After he had committed this savage outrage upon

67,67,612,617,623,"Very soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died,
leaving her husband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time
after her death, Master Andrew died. Now all the property of my old
master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers,—strangers who
had had nothing to do with accumulating it. Not a slave was left free.
All remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest. If any one thing
in my experience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of
the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable
loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor old
grandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old
age. She had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his
plantation with slaves; she had become a great grandmother in his
service. She had rocked him in infancy, attended him in childhood,
served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the
cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless
left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands of strangers; and in
their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and her
great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, without being
gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her
own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and
fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having
outlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning
and end of all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but
little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and
complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they
took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up a little
mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting
herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to
die! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter
loneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children,
the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. They
are, in the language of the slave’s poet, Whittier,—",very soon after my return to baltimore my mistress lucretia died leaving her husband and one child amanda and in a very short time after her death master andrew died now all the property of my old master slaves included was in the hands of strangers—strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it not a slave was left free all remained slaves from the youngest to the oldest if any one thing in my experience more than another served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother she had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age she had been the source of all his wealth she had peopled his plantation with slaves she had become a great grandmother in his service she had rocked him in infancy attended him in childhood served him through life and at his death wiped from his icy brow the cold death sweat and closed his eyes forever she was nevertheless left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands of strangers and in their hands she saw her children her grandchildren and her great grandchildren divided like so many sheep without being gratified with the small privilege of a single word as to their or her own destiny and to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity my grandmother who was now very old having outlived my old master and all his children having seen the beginning and end of all of them and her present owners finding she was of but little value her frame already racked with the pains of old age and complete helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs they took her to the woods built her a little hut put up a little mud chimney and then made her welcome to the privilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness thus virtually turning her out to die if my poor old grandmother now lives she lives to suffer in utter loneliness she lives to remember and mourn over the loss of children the loss of grandchildren and the loss of great grandchildren they are in the language of the slave’s poet whittier—,384,2184,-5.950000000000002,-0.45705438350910976,-1.308310991957105,-0.416387433906467,-10.950000000000005,-0.7546275481999203,-2.5857988165680488,-0.7487070604453314,-215.80738595765501,-0.16440940407315324,-2.1475189105191843,-0.8894192482292214,1.2197916666666675,0.13553284016865852,0.36882858307295235,0.03148787012484278,3.1020000000000003,-0.33208336215736156,-0.06742017332850042,-0.3807701654658861,-6.269339913442964,-0.3291875142091475,-0.2871531742540814,-0.23578403873306333,-6.94141153356308,-0.6087286166214867,-2.2271463052133478,-0.9858599090534587,"{'neg': 0.145, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': -0.9705}",-0.9705,-0.2911927545891683,-0.589515331355094,-0.3299247237509959,0.07406845238095239,-0.2022250369606868,-0.04063500685022549,-0.13612629006477836,-0.8144,-0.08680030333914686,0.052719185745081464,0.06680889050447267,0.5591239645449356,-0.12239269748028754,0.7911406369107989,0.05942461414846224,62.80324720842787,-0.1687823787331456,0.9477330825477059,-0.548168573071267

70,70,634,640,647,"In about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas
married his second wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the
eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master now lived in St.
Michael’s. Not long after his marriage, a misunderstanding took place
between himself and Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his
brother, he took me from him to live with himself at St. Michael’s.
Here I underwent another most painful separation. It, however, was not
so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, during
this interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his
once kind and affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and
of slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change in the characters
of both; so that, as far as they were concerned, I thought I had little
to lose by the change. But it was not to them that I was attached. It
was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the strongest
attachment. I had received many good lessons from them, and was still
receiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed. I

73,73,656,667,678,"I have now reached a period of my life when I can give dates. I left
Baltimore, and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael’s,
in March, 1832. It was now more than seven years since I lived with him
in the family of my old master, on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. We of
course were now almost entire strangers to each other. He was to me a
new master, and I to him a new slave. I was ignorant of his temper and
disposition; he was equally so of mine. A very short time, however,
brought us into full acquaintance with each other. I was made
acquainted with his wife not less than with himself. They were well
matched, being equally mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time
during a space of more than seven years, made to feel the painful
gnawings of hunger—a something which I had not experienced before since
I left Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. It went hard enough with me then,
when I could look back to no period at which I had enjoyed a
sufficiency. It was tenfold harder after living in Master Hugh’s
family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that which was
good. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He was so. Not to give
a slave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development
of meanness even among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse
the food, only let there be enough of it. This is the theory; and in
the part of Maryland from which I came, it is the general
practice,—though there are many exceptions. Master Thomas gave us
enough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were four slaves of us in
the kitchen—my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, and myself; and
we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week, and
very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables. It was not
enough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the
wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. This we
did by begging and stealing, whichever came handy in the time of need,
the one being considered as legitimate as the other. A great many times
have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger, when food in
abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke-house, and our pious
mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and her husband
would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basket
and store!",i have now reached a period of my life when i can give dates i left baltimore and went to live with master thomas auld at st michael’s in march  it was now more than seven years since i lived with him in the family of my old master on colonel lloyd’s plantation we of course were now almost entire strangers to each other he was to me a new master and i to him a new slave i was ignorant of his temper and disposition he was equally so of mine a very short time however brought us into full acquaintance with each other i was made acquainted with his wife not less than with himself they were well matched being equally mean and cruel i was now for the first time during a space of more than seven years made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger—a something which i had not experienced before since i left colonel lloyd’s plantation it went hard enough with me then when i could look back to no period at which i had enjoyed a sufficiency it was tenfold harder after living in master hugh’s family where i had always had enough to eat and of that which was good i have said master thomas was a mean man he was so not to give a slave enough to eat is regarded as the most aggravated development of meanness even among slaveholders the rule is no matter how coarse the food only let there be enough of it this is the theory and in the part of maryland from which i came it is the general practice—though there are many exceptions master thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food there were four slaves of us in the kitchen—my sister eliza my aunt priscilla henny and myself and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn meal per week and very little else either in the shape of meat or vegetables it was not enough for us to subsist upon we were therefore reduced to the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors this we did by begging and stealing whichever came handy in the time of need the one being considered as legitimate as the other a great many times have we poor creatures been nearly perishing with hunger when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safe and smoke house and our pious mistress was aware of the fact and yet that mistress and her husband would kneel every morning and pray that god would bless them in basket and store,440,2350,5.449999999999999,0.2835541233328642,1.1367292225201073,0.27582681152082644,-0.5499999999999994,-0.02120770649262883,-0.12426035502958568,-0.027701701214265063,42.33237425492561,0.08882911036019779,0.4212533034317286,0.15226195250561958,3.8165166666666654,0.41785874465282963,1.3170688765113432,0.3153819671964311,20.89399999999999,0.4895122832453901,2.2777210267901253,0.5204380613229589,105.67686990456774,0.5992745296031288,2.0696831795335284,0.6137582801038615,-1.9396212937575241,-0.13585643476446324,-0.557653062194999,-0.1760755002860598,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': -0.6066}",-0.6066,-0.21792417518564852,-0.37136948116176605,-0.19772648710752844,0.07000655594405594,-0.20504177879383553,-0.062313787360691736,-0.160427647730086,-0.9998,-0.08844568928328779,-0.04846235708243512,0.053499603463476174,0.8277476428338922,-0.07734835069702248,1.3933370591052803,0.2033439591234268,72.08925808465465,-0.16839411200126264,1.2274525791176338,-0.5435924274641076
74,74,679,703,728,"Bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every
element of character commanding respect. My master was one of this rare
sort. I do not know of one single noble act ever performed by him. The
leading trait in his character was meanness; and if there were any
other element in his nature, it was made subject to this. He was mean;
and, like most other mean men, he lacked the ability to conceal his
meanness. Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. He had been a poor
man, master only of a Bay craft. He came into possession of all his
slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst.
He was cruel, but cowardly. He commanded without firmness. In the
enforcement of his rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. At
times, he spoke to his slaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the
fury of a demon; at other times, he might well be mistaken for an
inquirer who had lost his way. He did nothing of himself. He might have
passed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things noble which he
attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. His airs, words,
and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders,
and, being assumed, were awkward enough. He was not even a good
imitator. He possessed all the disposition to deceive, but wanted the
power. Having no resources within himself, he was compelled to be the
copyist of many, and being such, he was forever the victim of
inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object of contempt, and was
held as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having slaves of his own
to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. He was a
slaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He found himself
incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. We
seldom called him “master;” we generally called him “Captain Auld,” and
were hardly disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our conduct
had much to do with making him appear awkward, and of consequence
fretful. Our want of reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly.
He wished to have us call him master, but lacked the firmness necessary
to command us to do so. His wife used to insist upon our calling him
so, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a Methodist
camp-meeting held in the Bay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced
religion. I indulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead him to
emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not do this, it would, at
any rate, make him more kind and humane. I was disappointed in both
these respects. It neither made him to be humane to his slaves, nor to
emancipate them. If it had any effect on his character, it made him
more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been
a much worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his
conversion, he relied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him
in his savage barbarity; but after his conversion, he found religious
sanction and support for his slaveholding cruelty. He made the greatest
pretensions to piety. His house was the house of prayer. He prayed
morning, noon, and night. He very soon distinguished himself among his
brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and exhorter. His activity
in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the hands
of the church in converting many souls. His house was the preachers’
home. They used to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for
while he starved us, he stuffed them. We have had three or four
preachers there at a time. The names of those who used to come most
frequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr.
Humphry, and Mr. Hickey. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our
house. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him to be a good man.
We thought him instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich
slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the
impression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the
slaves. When he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to
prayers. When the others were there, we were sometimes called in and
sometimes not. Mr. Cookman took more notice of us than either of the
other ministers. He could not come among us without betraying his
sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we had the sagacity to see it.",bad as all slaveholders are we seldom meet one destitute of every element of character commanding respect my master was one of

78,78,747,757,768,"My master and myself had quite a number of differences. He found me
unsuitable to his purpose. My city life, he said, had had a very
pernicious effect upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good
purpose, and fitted me for every thing which was bad. One of my
greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away, and go down to
his father-in-law’s farm, which was about five miles from St.
Michael’s. I would then have to go after it. My reason for this kind of
carelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to
eat when I went there. Master William Hamilton, my master’s
father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough to eat. I never left there
hungry, no matter how great the need of my speedy return. Master Thomas
at length said he would stand it no longer. I had lived with him nine
months, during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings,
all to no good purpose. He resolved to put me out, as he said, to be
broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a man named
Edward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm-renter. He rented the
place upon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it.
Mr. Covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young
slaves, and this reputation was of immense value to him. It enabled him
to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could
have had it done without such a reputation. Some slaveholders thought
it not much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their slaves one year, for
the sake of the training to which they were subjected, without any
other compensation. He could hire young help with great ease, in
consequence of this reputation. Added to the natural good qualities of
Mr. Covey, he was a professor of religion—a pious soul—a member and a
class-leader in the Methodist church. All of this added weight to his
reputation as a “nigger-breaker.” I was aware of all the facts, having
been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there. I
nevertheless made the change gladly; for I was sure of getting enough
to eat, which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man.",my master and myself had quite a number of differences he found me unsuitable to his purpose my city life he said had had a very pernicious effect upon me it had almost ruined me for every good purpose and fitted me for every thing which was bad one of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away and go down to his father in law’s farm which was about five miles from st michael’s i would then have to go after it my reason for this kind of carelessness or carefulness was that i could always get something to eat when i went there master william hamilton my master’s father in law always gave his slaves enough to eat i never left there hungry no matter how great the need of my speedy return master thomas at length said he would stand it no longer i had lived with him nine months during which time he had given me a number of severe whippings all to no good purpose he resolved to put me out as he said to be broken and for this purpose he let me for one year to a man named edward covey mr covey was a poor man a farm renter he rented the place upon which he lived as also the hands with which he tilled it mr covey had acquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves and this reputation was of immense value to him it enabled him to get his farm tilled with much less expense to himself than he could have had it done without such a reputation some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow mr covey to have their slaves one year for the sake of the training to which they were subjected without any other compensation he could hire young help with great ease in consequence of this reputation added to the natural good qualities of mr covey he was a professor of religion—a pious soul—a member and a class leader in the methodist church all of this added weight to his reputation as a “nigger breaker” i was aware of all the facts having been made acquainted with them by a young man who had lived there i nevertheless made the change gladly for i was sure of getting enough to eat which is not the smallest consideration to a hungry man,402,2129,11.65,0.7243343495885695,2.4664879356568368,0.6878047308913474,3.3999999999999995,0.2399206626428014,0.8106508875739644,0.2290065890272936,100.0507101504597,0.14756816738548587,0.9956137094452604,0.393881484941465,4.44672619047619,0.5404781573527263,1.5472010868088577,0.43868247522274045,7.7790000000000035,-0.09706812506283173,0.5490493294230073,-0.12298196238151295,75.01663452321172,0.4053800586982845,1.4241842610802922,0.4363449334625584,0.49208949014796005,0.05900039823504585,0.25400127116682536,0.15761303407670987,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9535}",0.9535,0.021297563995654217,0.5638581662320534,0.2339004441638109,0.15869259259259258,-0.18539242770331807,0.4110131801569211,0.00909655328910359,-0.9992,-0.09076318306954384,-0.04813490872376999,0.03475373406618305,1.075972584551769,0.0069051104105662215,1.9498039080222405,0.4725387371678666,67.2522303202212,-0.1637541397815151,1.0817483591682533,-0.48890530969904733
79,79,769,784,800,"I had left Master Thomas’s house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on
the 1st of January, 1833. I was now, for the first time in my life, a
field hand. In my new employment, I found myself even more awkward than
a country boy appeared to be in a large city. I had been at my new home
but one week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whipping, cutting
my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridges on my flesh as
large as my little finger. The details of this affair are as follows:
Mr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest days
in the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood. He gave
me a team of unbroken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox, and
which the off-hand one. He then tied the end of a large rope around the
horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me the other end of it, and told me,
if the oxen started to run, that I must hold on upon the rope. I had
never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward. I, however,
succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty;
but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen took
fright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and
over stumps, in the most frightful manner. I expected every moment that
my brains would be dashed out against the trees. After running thus for
a considerable distance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with
great force against a tree, and threw themselves into a dense thicket.
How I escaped death, I do not know. There I was, entirely alone, in a
thick wood, in a place new to me. My cart was upset and shattered, my
oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was none to help
me. After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cart
righted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. I now
proceeded with my team to the place where I had, the day before, been
chopping wood, and loaded my cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way
to tame my oxen. I then proceeded on my way home. I had now consumed
one half of the day. I got out of the woods safely, and now felt out of
danger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate; and just as I did so,
before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed
through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body of the
cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing
me against the gate-post. Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death
by the merest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened,
and how it happened. He ordered me to return to the woods again
immediately. I did so, and he followed on after me. Just as I got into
the woods, he came up and told me to stop my cart, and that he would
teach me how to trifle away my time, and break gates. He then went to a
large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three large switches, and, after
trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife, he ordered me to take off
my clothes. I made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on. He
repeated his order. I still made him no answer, nor did I move to strip
myself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore
off my clothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches,

after. This whipping was the first of a number just like it, and for
similar offences.",i had left master thomas’s house and went to live with mr covey on the  of january  i was now for the first time in my life a field hand in my new employment i found myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a large city i had been at my new home but one week before mr covey gave me a very severe whipping cutting my back causing the blood to run and raising ridges on my flesh as large as my little finger the details of this affair are as follows mr covey sent me very early in the morning of one of our coldest days in the month of january to the woods to get a load of wood he gave me a team of unbroken oxen he told me which was the in hand ox and which the off hand one he then tied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in hand ox and gave me the other end of it and told me if the oxen started to run that i must hold on upon the rope i had never driven oxen before and of course i was very awkward i however succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with little difficulty but i had got a very few rods into the woods when the oxen took fright and started full tilt carrying the cart against trees and over stumps in the most frightful manner i expected every moment that my brains would be dashed out against the trees after running thus for a considerable distance they finally upset the cart dashing it with great force against a tree and threw themselves into a dense thicket how i escaped death i do not know there i was entirely alone in a thick wood in a place new to me my cart was upset and shattered my oxen were entangled among the young trees and there was none to help me after a long spell of effort i succeeded in getting my cart righted my oxen disentangled and again yoked to the cart i now proceeded with my team to the place where i had the day before been chopping wood and loaded my cart pretty heavily thinking in this way to tame my oxen i then proceeded on my way home i had now consumed one half of the day i got out of the woods safely and now felt out of danger i stopped my oxen to open the woods gate and just as i did so before i could get hold of my ox rope the oxen again started rushed through the gate catching it between the wheel and the body of the cart tearing it to pieces and coming within a few inches of crushing me against the gate post thus twice in one short day i escaped death by the merest chance on my return i told mr covey what had happened and how it happened he ordered me to return to the woods again immediately i did so and he followed on after me just as i got into the woods he came up and told me to stop my cart and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time and break gates he then went to a large gum tree and with his axe cut three large switches and after trimming them up neatly with his pocketknife he ordered me to take off my clothes i made him no answer but stood with my clothes on he repeated his order i still made him no answer nor did i move to strip myself upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger tore off my clothes and lashed me till he had worn out his switches cutting me so savagely as to leave the marks visible for a long time after this whipping was the first of a number just like it and for similar offences,675,3372,-3.35,-0.17729689692756576,-0.7506702412868632,-0.15491039754020794,-3.1,-0.11112032467582558,-0.727810650887574,-0.1160923826303457,-79.84337188682782,0.006303941905913188,-0.7945286499148035,-0.18720030014050787,0.31160714285714364,-0.003895296954482995,0.03718886020921092,-0.1087147271793912,9.190000000000001,-0.2166526705252787,0.7350314693379904,-0.2541542449643059,-30.276033822637654,-0.43244716762471264,-0.792573134710292,-0.3302665714220281,-2.7212066254725973,-0.12282017068178358,-0.8185299417882733,-0.1537511517458865,"{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.9866}",-0.9866,-0.22321777629901343,-0.5991667415999761,-0.20727771272672094,0.0418162996423866,-0.21314291137501412,-0.21276823355150135,-0.23031993179831556,-0.9966,-0.07979903112880848,-0.04671596583622125,0.12344116078206824,0.4189532800997915,-0.21089179829670318,0.47690815670993647,-0.22333523320054743,102.64996103866075,-0.18419500651073448,2.1480227312593487,-0.7298231499574848

year, scarce a week passed without his whipping me. I was seldom free
from a sore back. My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for
whipping me. We were worked fully up to the point of endurance. Long
before day we were up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day
we were off to the field with our hoes and ploughing teams. Mr. Covey
gave us enough to eat, but scarce time to eat it. We were often less
than five minutes taking our meals. We were often in the field from the
first approach of day till its last lingering ray had left us; and at

81,81,809,819,829,"Covey would be out with us. The way he used to stand it, was this. He
would spend the most of his afternoons in bed. He would then come out
fresh in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words, example, and
frequently with the whip. Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who
could and did work with his hands. He was a hard-working man. He knew
by himself just what a man or a boy could do. There was no deceiving
him. His work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence;
and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with
us. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where
we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at
taking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him,
among ourselves, “the snake.” When we were at work in the cornfield, he
would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and
all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out, “Ha, ha!
Come, come! Dash on, dash on!” This being his mode of attack, it was
never safe to stop a single minute. His comings were like a thief in
the night. He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every
tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every window, on the
plantation. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to St.
Michael’s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards
you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching
every motion of the slaves. He would, for this purpose, leave his horse
tied up in the woods. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us, and give
us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long
journey, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the
house to get ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would
turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and
there watch us till the going down of the sun.",covey would be out with us the way he used to stand it was this he would spend the most of his afternoons in bed he would then come out fresh in the evening ready to urge us on with his words example and frequently with the whip mr covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with his hands he was a hard working man he knew by himself just what a man or a boy could do there was no deceiving him his work went on in his absence almost as well as in his presence and he had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us this he did by surprising us he seldom approached the spot where we were at work openly if he could do it secretly he always aimed at taking us by surprise such was his cunning that we used to call him among ourselves “the snake” when we were at work in the cornfield he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoid detection and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst and scream out “ha ha come come dash on dash on” this being his mode of attack it was never safe to stop a single minute his comings were like a thief in the night he appeared to us as being ever at hand he was under every tree behind every stump in every bush and at every window on the plantation he would sometimes mount his horse as if bound to st michael’s a distance of seven miles and in half an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood fence watching every motion of the slaves he would for this purpose leave his horse tied up in the woods again he would sometimes walk up to us and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a long journey turn his back upon us and make as though he was going to the house to get ready and before he would get half way thither he would turn short and crawl into a fence corner or behind some tree and there watch us till the going down of the sun,387,1938,0.6000000000000003,-0.004282443966443852,0.09651474530831115,0.0067986132233602775,1.6000000000000005,0.12362673386495888,0.38461538461538475,0.11468114931779029,57.484275198189316,0.10896183160870761,0.5720312467425148,0.23507667478881736,1.468099999999999,0.16721984074413437,0.459502784947697,0.06335087764346732,-2.0009999999999986,-0.6082958500405842,-0.7400402016673803,-0.6837476311024643,-18.79884799224776,-0.4459213962987416,-0.5509405787871082,-0.3425954841100172,-0.49517822734538575,-0.027615584992136913,-0.07552809819540601,0.00928484845161724,"{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.319}",0.319,-0.07741385587751654,0.1834966879477265,0.05579578115489209,-0.017864774114774114,-0.22215763309660955,-0.5312925777120315,-0.30809417941717415,0.7209,-0.04351830902539973,0.8906049608426337,0.4169106329435108,0.047837727323478275,-0.26354965856290785,-0.3550529701949759,-0.39158020284701495,65.52858541870604,-0.16102726773786938,1.0298275623327178,-0.45676615766998235
82,82,830,840,851,"Mr. Covey’s _forte_ consisted in his power to deceive. His life was
devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every
thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made
conform to his disposition to deceive. He seemed to think himself equal
to deceiving the Almighty. He would make a short prayer in the morning,
and a long prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem, few men would
at times appear more devotional than he. The exercises of his family
devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as he was a very
poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon
me. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times
do so; at others, I would not. My non-compliance would almost always
produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me, he would
start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner.
In this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor
man! such was his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily
believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that
he was a sincere worshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a
time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman
slave to commit the sin of adultery. The facts in the case are these:
Mr. Covey was a poor man; he was just commencing in life; he was only
able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is the fact, he bought her, as
he said, for _a breeder_. This woman was named Caroline. Mr. Covey
bought her from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael’s.
She was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She had
already given birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he
wanted. After buying her, he hired a married man of Mr. Samuel
Harrison, to live with him one year; and him he used to fasten up with
her every night! The result was, that, at the end of the year, the
miserable woman gave birth to twins. At this result Mr. Covey seemed to
be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman. Such was
his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Caroline
during her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. The
children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.",mr covey’s forte consisted in his power to deceive his life was devoted to planning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions every thing he possessed in the shape of learning or religion he made conform to his disposition to deceive he seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the almighty he would make a short prayer in the morning and a long prayer at night and strange as it may seem few men would at times appear more devotional than he the exercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing and as he was a very poor singer himself the duty of raising the hymn generally came upon me he would read his hymn and nod at me to commence i would at times do so at others i would not my non compliance would almost always produce much confusion to show himself independent of me he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner in this state of mind he prayed with more than ordinary spirit poor man such was his disposition and success at deceiving i do verily believe that he sometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief that he was a sincere worshipper of the most high god and this too at a time when he may be said to have been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery the facts in the case are these mr covey was a poor man he was just commencing in life he was only able to buy one slave and shocking as is the fact he bought her as he said for a breeder this woman was named caroline mr covey bought her from mr thomas lowe about six miles from st michael’s she was a large able bodied woman about twenty years old she had already given birth to one child which proved her to be just what he wanted after buying her he hired a married man of mr samuel harrison to live with him one year and him he used to fasten up with her every night the result was that at the end of the year the miserable woman gave birth to twins at this result mr covey seemed to be highly pleased both with the man and the wretched woman such was his joy and that of his wife that nothing they could do for caroline during her confinement was too good or too hard to be done the children were regarded as being quite an addition to his wealth,426,2282,-2.2499999999999996,-0.18576326271247162,-0.5147453083109917,-0.16282353781495307,-2.2499999999999996,-0.12965640498794803,-0.5266272189349112,-0.13431470562213568,-198.45659325717614,-0.12742140862920498,-1.974859595494221,-0.73727138243937,1.9979166666666668,0.21325618708061403,0.6529747588642848,0.1096429350426939,12.748000000000008,0.1233848738089626,1.2040069858635123,0.11883292224599955,49.83045391652988,0.1533185564536462,0.893932221610725,0.20570878141569607,-2.599749400357435,-0.1944784348777892,-0.7779900536834485,-0.2764645346253336,"{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': -0.7469}",-0.7469,-0.24182066541714986,-0.4554746275814525,-0.2408428392504302,0.07080507455507455,-0.20444948577777255,-0.05805200718713776,-0.1553176570818054,-0.9141,-0.08707129021599581,-0.0016918165197696902,0.06461691716158086,0.49946623439246807,-0.1524364867971014,0.657400856847871,-0.036567064892782046,69.86826513460606,-0.1681647389711338,1.160550328177628,-0.5408890169011308

slave; you shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of the hottest
days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith, William Hughes, a slave
named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was
clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli was turning, Smith
was feeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple,
requiring strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused
to such work, it came very hard. About three o’clock of that day, I
broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violent aching
of the head, attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every limb.
Finding what was coming, I nerved myself up, feeling it would never do
to stop work. I stood as long as I could stagger to the hopper with
grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as if held down
by an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his own
work to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own
go on at the same time.",i have already intimated that my condition was much worse during the first six months of my stay at mr covey’s than in the last six the circumstances leading to the change in mr covey’s course toward me form an epoch in my humble history you have seen how a man was made a slave you shall see how a slave was made a man on one of the hottest days of the month of august  bill smith william hughes a slave named eli and myself were engaged in fanning wheat hughes was clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan eli was turning smith was feeding and i was carrying wheat to the fan the work was simple requiring strength rather than intellect yet to one entirely unused to such work it came very hard about three of the clock of that day i broke down my strength failed me i was seized with a violent aching of the head attended with extreme dizziness i trembled in every limb finding what was coming i nerved myself up feeling it would never do to stop work i stood as long as i could stagger to the hopper with grain when i could stand no longer i fell and felt as if held down by an immense weight the fan of course stopped every one had his own work to do and no one could do the work of the other and have his own go on at the same time,250,1282,-4.2,-0.4917246970008408,-0.9329758713136729,-0.44879225328228217,-3.7,-0.3856900484574214,-0.8698224852071007,-0.3860145078189531,-30.667974939817714,0.004616698055863436,-0.30517980577138276,-0.19414067492348688,-2.025166666666666,-0.44362649862289427,-0.816125635103926,-0.5508884366019966,-5.326999999999997,-0.944734756147417,-1.17843608923452,-1.0527874522016694,-25.770770040059578,-0.6432223301654449,-0.697722496323834,-0.5231257427058116,-1.4231176053505814,-0.18028615172825,-0.38525490544563334,-0.25216052593068805,"{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': -0.613}",-0.613,-0.2863870663913156,-0.37520606660072536,-0.3212538376660402,-0.07580409356725146,-0.2435915698629625,-0.840520990806618,-0.49301484108550414,-0.9999,-0.10721306507332921,-0.048516931808879296,-0.09830696343066576,-0.17224704141017413,-0.3496354126833891,-0.8484356129876901,-0.6666292651479572,45.36187367054978,-0.14474587063374098,0.4223522391983489,-0.2648721896363486

treading-yard where we were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he left
immediately, and came to the spot where we were. He hastily inquired
what the matter was. Bill answered that I was sick, and there was no
one to bring wheat to the fan. I had by this time crawled away under
the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard was enclosed,
hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He then asked where I
was. He was told by one of the hands. He came to the spot, and, after
looking at me awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well
as I could, for I scarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a
savage kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to do so, but
fell back in the attempt. He gave me another kick, and again told me to
rise. I again tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but, stooping to
get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and
fell. While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickory slat
with which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and
with it gave me a heavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and
the blood ran freely; and with this again told me to get up. I made no
effort to comply, having now made up my mind to let him do his worst.
In a short time after receiving this blow, my head grew better. Mr.
Covey had now left me to my fate. At this moment I resolved, for the
first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask his
protection. In order to do this, I must that afternoon walk seven
miles; and this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe
undertaking. I was exceedingly feeble; made so as much by the kicks and
blows which I received, as by the severe fit of sickness to which I had
been subjected. I, however, watched my chance, while Covey was looking
in an opposite direction, and started for St. Michael’s. I succeeded in
getting a considerable distance on my way to the woods, when Covey
discovered me, and called after me to come back, threatening what he
would do if I did not come. I disregarded both his calls and his
threats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would
allow; and thinking I might be overhauled by him if I kept the road, I
walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid
detection, and near enough to prevent losing my way. I had not gone far
before my little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I
fell down, and lay for a considerable time. The blood was yet oozing
from the wound on my head. For a time I thought I should bleed to
death; and think now that I should have done so, but that the blood so
matted my hair as to stop the wound. After lying there about three
quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on my way,
through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feet
sometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven
miles, occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master’s
store. I then presented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart
of iron. From the crown of my head to my feet, I was covered with
blood. My hair was all clotted with dust and blood; my shirt was stiff
with blood. I suppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild
beasts, and barely escaped them. In this state I appeared before my
master, humbly entreating him to interpose his authority for my
protection. I told him all the circumstances as well as I could, and it
seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him. He would then walk the
floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deserved it.
He asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let me get a new home; that
as sure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die
with him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it.
Master Thomas ridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr.
Covey’s killing me, and said that he knew Mr. Covey; that he was a good
man, and that he could not think of taking me from him; that, should he
do so, he would lose the whole year’s wages; that I belonged to Mr.
Covey for one year, and that I must go back to him, come what might;
and that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that he would
himself _get hold of me_. After threatening me thus, he gave me a very
large dose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael’s
that night, (it being quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr.
Covey’s early in the morning; and that if I did not, he would _get hold
of me,_ which meant that he would whip me. I remained all night, and,
according to his orders, I started off to Covey’s in the morning,
(Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken in spirit. I got no
supper that night, or breakfast that morning. I reached Covey’s about
nine o’clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided
Mrs. Kemp’s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give
me another whipping. Before he could reach me, I succeeded in getting
to the cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it afforded me the
means of hiding. He seemed very angry, and searched for me a long time.
My behavior was altogether unaccountable. He finally gave up the chase,
thinking, I suppose, that I must come home for something to eat; he
would give himself no further trouble in looking for me. I spent that
day mostly in the woods, having the alternative before me,—to go home
and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and be starved to death.
That night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a slave with whom I was
somewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wife who lived about four miles
from Mr. Covey’s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to see her.
I told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home
with him. I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and
got his advice as to what course it was best for me to pursue. I found
Sandy an old adviser. He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back
to Covey; but that before I went, I must go with him into another part
of the woods, where there was a certain _root,_ which, if I would take
some of it with me, carrying it _always on my right side,_ would render
it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. He
said he had carried it for years; and since he had done so, he had
never received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it. I at
first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my
pocket would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed
to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness,
telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good. To please him, I at
length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it upon
my right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home;
and upon entering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to
meeting. He spoke to me very kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot
near by, and passed on towards the church. Now, this singular conduct
of Mr. Covey really made me begin to think that there was something in
the _root_ which Sandy had given me; and had it been on any other day
than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to no other cause than
the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclined to think
the _root_ to be something more than I at first had taken it to be. All
went well till Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the
_root_ was fully tested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and
rub, curry, and feed, the horses. I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But
whilst thus engaged, whilst in the act of throwing down some blades
from the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stable with a long rope; and just
as I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about
tying me. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring,
and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawling on the
stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do
what he pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t
know—I resolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I
seized Covey hard by the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to
me, and I to him. My resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey
seemed taken all aback. He trembled like a leaf. This gave me
assurance, and I held him uneasy, causing the blood to run where I
touched him with the ends of my fingers. Mr. Covey soon called out to
Hughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attempted to
tie my right hand. While he was in the act of doing so, I watched my
chance, and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs. This kick
fairly sickened Hughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr. Covey.
This kick had the effect of not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also.
When he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his courage quailed. He
asked me if I meant to persist in my resistance. I told him I did, come
what might; that he had used me like a brute for six months, and that I
was determined to be used so no longer. With that, he strove to drag me
to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. He meant to
knock me down. But just as he was leaning over to get the stick, I
seized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden
snatch to the ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him
for assistance. Bill wanted to know what he could do. Covey said, “Take
hold of him, take hold of him!” Bill said his master hired him out to
work, and not to help to whip me; so he left Covey and myself to fight
our own battle out. We were at it for nearly two hours. Covey at length
let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that if I had
not resisted, he would not have whipped me half so much. The truth was,
that he had not whipped me at all. I considered him as getting entirely
the worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but I
had from him. The whole six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr.
Covey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me in anger. He
would occasionally say, he didn’t want to get hold of me again. “No,”
thought I, “you need not; for you will come off worse than you did
before.”",mr covey was at the house about one hundred yards from the treading yard where we were fanning on hearing the fan stop he left immediately and came to the spot where we were he hastily inquired what the matter was bill answered that i was sick and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan i had by this time crawled away under the side of the post and rail fence by which the yard was enclosed hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun he then asked where i was he was told by one of the hands he came to the spot and after looking at me awhile asked me what was the matter i told him as well as i could for i scarce had strength to speak he then gave me a savage kick in the side and told me to get up i tried to do so but fell back in the attempt he gave me another kick and

white man in defence of myself. And the only explanation I can now
think of does not entirely satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give
it. Mr. Covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a
first-rate overseer and negro-breaker. It was of considerable
importance to him. That reputation was at stake; and had he sent me—a
boy about sixteen years old—to the public whipping-post, his reputation
would have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he suffered me to go
unpunished.",it was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why mr covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping post and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself and the only explanation i can now think of does not entirely satisfy me but such as it is i will give it mr covey enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being a first rate overseer and negro breaker it was of considerable importance to him that reputation was at stake and had he sent me—a boy about sixteen years old—to the public whipping post his reputation would have been lost so to save his reputation he suffered me to go unpunished,129,695,5.050000000000001,0.9944058490450569,1.0509383378016088,0.9402287004793443,1.0499999999999998,0.23136201043568988,0.2544378698224852,0.22059280778194656,51.19617818766674,0.20450464946799965,0.5094578219204096,0.6280862351708785,1.59375,0.606889631842546,0.5053861160168456,0.505462835388158,5.325,0.36010062241223023,0.22559066794081767,0.3784864163284432,13.459120112532222,0.10757025479790108,0.12819587480307792,0.16384910763528798,-0.20162052885721998,-0.03742079864805071,0.022455337847498244,-0.007506389112856224,"{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.7157}",0.7157,0.22388490188736218,0.421305038515721,0.5994280557758839,0.11818181818181818,-0.141918185137374,0.1948027965580691,0.3841693076999472,-0.9879,-0.14696302292901525,-0.04196796463557725,-0.4198385778538458,0.266950734865197,-0.057416952886794756,0.136151193333597,0.2670259508078779,26.815530338010255,-0.10925682039691598,-0.1363132512193154,0.15340485551738095

1833. The days between Christmas and New Year’s day are allowed as
holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor,
more than to feed and take care of the stock. This time we regarded as
our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused
it nearly as we pleased. Those of us who had families at a distance,
were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society.
This time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober,
thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in
making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class
of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons. But
by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing
ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking
whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most
agreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would work during
the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them.
He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was
deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as
lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means,
during the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.",my term of actual service to mr edward covey ended on christmas day  the days between christmas and new year’s day are allowed as holidays and accordingly we were not required to perform any labor more than to feed and take care of the stock this time we regarded as our own by the grace of our masters and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased those of us who had families at a distance were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society this time however was spent in various ways the staid sober thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn brooms mats horse collars and baskets and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums hares and coons but by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball wrestling running foot races fiddling dancing and drinking whisky and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters a slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them he was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master it was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at christmas and he was regarded as lazy indeed who had not provided himself with the necessary means during the year to get whisky enough to last him through christmas,247,1395,0.9000000000000008,0.0513229729072714,0.16085790884718526,0.05877055430602167,-0.0999999999999992,0.0015258157402619728,-0.01775147928994065,-0.0053529857418869245,46.087279554657414,0.12360115509820759,0.4586187073200135,0.29529464007190454,3.3916666666666666,0.6775970679325389,1.1619273468278768,0.5765630192756093,14.385000000000014,0.7136839222430291,1.4197779022638164,0.7663319221386127,-25.790830129343917,-0.6480482709252996,-0.6981448272608298,-0.5275414761555738,-0.35654511329523647,-0.03328838474519674,-0.02925525665890972,-0.0004297107259753893,"{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9238}",0.9238,0.10856554010430383,0.5460540119293829,0.3913577423798796,0.11528925619834712,-0.17938881895402592,0.17936488046966673,0.0608925119325787,-0.7114,-0.09505039328837016,0.10893115398259066,7.511558725566187e-05,0.4776550363140964,-0.07177794516855907,0.6085048491309275,0.2211417333648599,44.389866605256934,-0.14707122126376573,0.39307278534134404,-0.2922789752218322

inhumanity of slavery. They are professedly a custom established by the
benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the
result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon
the down-trodden slave. They do not give the slaves this time because
they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but
because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will
be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves
spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their
ending as of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust
their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of
dissipation. For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the
slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him
drunk. One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink
the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in
getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when the slave asks
for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance,
cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with
the name of liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the
result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think
that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt,
and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as
to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of
our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,—feeling,
upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us
into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.",the holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud wrong and inhumanity of slavery they are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders but i undertake to say it is the result of selfishness and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down trodden slave they do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it this will be seen by the fact that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning their object seems to be to disgust their slaves with freedom by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation for instance the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord but will adopt various plans to make him drunk one plan is to make bets on their slaves as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess thus when the slave asks for virtuous freedom the cunning slaveholder knowing his ignorance cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation artfully labelled with the name of liberty the most of us used to drink it down and the result was just what might be supposed many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery we felt and very properly too that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum so when the holidays ended we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing took a long breath and marched to the field—feeling upon the whole rather glad to go from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom back to the arms of slavery,329,1794,-10.349999999999998,-0.8811115506593038,-2.2520107238605895,-0.81273504437152,-10.35,-0.833800686719545,-2.4437869822485205,-0.8265400476834589,-73.57206461991734,-0.034223256025511926,-0.7321223013572559,-0.35390645973905605,6.445183333333334,0.9784841914579443,2.276973237331885,0.8791214345573412,0.01900000000000157,-0.49929470623666483,-0.47378653573664586,-0.5641842813267584,-31.653467459358545,-0.6183478614889514,-0.8215726486306943,-0.5003656159563141,-7.1234037683141676,-0.7324128500827272,-2.287891516753958,-1.197666751811536,"{'neg': 0.174, 'neu': 0.688, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': -0.9233}",-0.9233,-0.30899085367786494,-0.5612205137427689,-0.3620377704933538,0.019625603864734296,-0.21333450724794442,-0.3312023764726393,-0.23197291958032729,-0.9989,-0.0967454199722403,-0.04797118454443746,-0.013635708160880097,0.11219125211130061,-0.24051910443517852,-0.2107862300859984,-0.31799622392017013,55.79999618512764,-0.16065076381047425,0.7367764213181252,-0.45232864950369744

of fraud and inhumanity of slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to
disgust the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse
of it, is carried out in other things. For instance, a slave loves
molasses; he steals some. His master, in many cases, goes off to town,
and buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip, and commands the
slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow is made sick at the
very mention of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make the
slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance.
A slave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. His master is
enraged at him; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives
him more than is necessary, and compels him to eat it within a given
time. Then, if he complains that he cannot eat it, he is said to be
satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped for being hard to
please! I have an abundance of such illustrations of the same
principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I have

97,97,1030,1040,1051,"On the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey, and went to live with
Mr. William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael’s. I
soon found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey. Though not
rich, he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr.
Covey, as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker and
slave-driver. The former (slaveholder though he was) seemed to possess
some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, and some respect for
humanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments.
Mr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as
being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to
say, that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which
Mr. Covey was constantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and we
always knew where to find him. The other was a most artful deceiver,
and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect
his cunningly-devised frauds. Another advantage I gained in my new
master was, he made no pretensions to, or profession of, religion; and
this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. I assert most
unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere covering for
the most horrid crimes,—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,—a
sanctifier of the most hateful frauds,—and a dark shelter under, which
the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders
find the strongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains
of slavery, next to that enslavement, I should regard being the slave
of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me. For
of all slaveholders with whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders
are the worst. I have ever found them the meanest and basest, the most
cruel and cowardly, of all others. It was my unhappy lot not only to
belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in a community of such
religionists. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, and
in the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These were
members and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden
owned, among others, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten. This
woman’s back, for weeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of
this merciless, _religious_ wretch. He used to hire hands. His maxim
was, Behave well or behave ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally
to whip a slave, to remind him of his master’s authority. Such was his
theory, and such his practice.",on the first of january  i left mr covey and went to live with mr william freeland who lived about three miles from st michael’s i soon found mr freeland a very different man from mr covey though not rich he was what would be called an educated southern gentleman mr covey as i have shown was a well trained negro breaker and slave driver the former slaveholder though he was seemed to possess some regard for honor some reverence for justice and some respect for humanity the latter seemed totally insensible to all such sentiments mr freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders such as being very passionate and fretful but i must do him the justice to say that he was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which mr covey was constantly addicted the one was open and frank and we always knew where to find him the other was a most artful deceiver and could be understood only by such as were skilful enough to detect his cunningly devised frauds another advantage i gained in my new master was he made no pretensions to or profession of religion and this in my opinion was truly a great advantage i assert most unhesitatingly that the religion of the south is a mere covering for the most horrid crimes—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity—a sanctifier of the most hateful frauds—and a dark shelter under which the darkest foulest grossest and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protection were i to be again reduced to the chains of slavery next to that enslavement i should regard being the slave of a religious master the greatest calamity that could befall me for of all slaveholders with whom i have ever met religious slaveholders are the worst i have ever found them the meanest and basest the most cruel and cowardly of all others it was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder but to live in a community of such religionists very near mr freeland lived the rev daniel weeden and in the same neighborhood lived the rev rigby hopkins these were members and ministers in the reformed methodist church mr weeden owned among others a woman slave whose name i have forgotten this woman’s back for weeks was kept literally raw made so by the lash of this merciless religious wretch he used to hire hands his maxim was behave well or behave ill it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave to remind him of his master’s authority such was his theory and such his practice,441,2543,3.4999999999999982,0.16535238636344277,0.7184986595174261,0.1653488391392023,-1.4999999999999991,-0.07907729539057075,-0.3491124260355028,-0.08459174066941105,28.21254534481887,0.07642669171373537,0.28074560271892957,0.10124535901243925,1.929949999999999,0.19714862408608003,0.6281555223475068,0.09344590182779337,21.973999999999997,0.5383244752590057,2.4200744719412115,0.5739801525650602,24.86163741207731,-0.06602667095372651,0.3682564122696741,0.005008004944161269,-3.069940577644981,-0.22418329175934784,-0.9349300603157372,-0.32733352394267573,"{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': -0.9803}",-0.9803,-0.27177442527442547,-0.5953901028085005,-0.29488830138728034,0.023287666878575957,-0.21390532950991586,-0.3116575501763715,-0.2368976719265446,-0.9242,-0.08652713902472804,-0.007203863890632243,0.06901847682244462,0.3981478621509189,-0.1810003433311158,0.43026689138709845,-0.12783027139712194,71.41651238521483,-0.17094184293754278,1.2071876784110613,-0.5736202067583596
98,98,1052,1063,1075,"Mr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. His chief boast was his
ability to manage slaves. The peculiar feature of his government was
that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He always managed
to have one or more of his slaves to whip every Monday morning. He did
this to alarm their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped.
His plan was to whip for the smallest offences, to prevent the
commission of large ones. Mr. Hopkins could always find some excuse for
whipping a slave. It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slaveholding
life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things, of
which to make occasion to whip a slave. A mere look, word, or motion,—a
mistake, accident, or want of power,—are all matters for which a slave
may be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said,
he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he speak
loudly when spoken to by his master? Then he is getting high-minded,
and should be taken down a button-hole lower. Does he forget to pull
off his hat at the approach of a white person? Then he is wanting in
reverence, and should be whipped for it. Does he ever venture to
vindicate his conduct, when censured for it? Then he is guilty of
impudence,—one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty.
Does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from
that pointed out by his master? He is indeed presumptuous, and getting
above himself; and nothing less than a flogging will do for him. Does
he, while ploughing, break a plough,—or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It
is owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave must always be
whipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find something of this sort to
justify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace such
opportunities. There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the
slaves who had the getting their own home, would not prefer to live,
rather than with this Rev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a man any
where round, who made higher professions of religion, or was more
active in revivals,—more attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer and
preaching meetings, or more devotional in his family,—that prayed
earlier, later, louder, and longer,—than this same reverend
slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.",mr hopkins was even worse than mr weeden his chief boast was his ability to manage slaves the peculiar feature of his government was that of whipping slaves in advance of deserving it he always managed to have one or more of his slaves to whip every monday morning he did this to alarm their fears and strike terror into those who escaped his plan was to whip for the smallest offences to prevent the commission of large ones mr hopkins could always find some excuse for whipping a slave it would astonish one unaccustomed to a slaveholding life to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can find things of which to make occasion to whip a slave a mere look word or motion—a mistake accident or want of power—are all matters for which a slave may be whipped at any time does a slave look dissatisfied it is said he has the devil in him and it must be whipped out does he speak loudly when spoken to by his master then he is getting high minded and should be taken down a button hole lower does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person then he is wanting in reverence and should be whipped for it does he ever venture to vindicate his conduct when censured for it then he is guilty of impudence—one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty does he ever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed out by his master he is indeed presumptuous and getting above himself and nothing less than a flogging will do for him does he while ploughing break a plough—or while hoeing break a hoe it is owing to his carelessness and for it a slave must always be whipped mr hopkins could always find something of this sort to justify the use of the lash and he seldom failed to embrace such opportunities there was not a man in the whole county with whom the slaves who had the getting their own home would not prefer to live rather than with this rev mr hopkins and yet there was not a man any where round who made higher professions of religion or was more active in revivals—more attentive to the class love feast prayer and preaching meetings or more devotional in his family—that prayed earlier later louder and longer—than this same reverend slave driver rigby hopkins,415,2296,-14.900000000000002,-0.9991749523839626,-3.227882037533513,-0.923083720875248,-16.9,-1.0829916151416763,-3.9940828402366866,-1.071512960395885,-270.3364692407827,-0.19881076923399768,-2.690142773943255,-1.0309271679382412,-0.17620833333333463,-0.04940952254516584,-0.14094563238690452,-0.1544817636884478,-2.2800000000000007,-0.6150388909306548,-0.7768148416647443,-0.6911440723539588,-62.38973191898382,-0.8142671867283702,-1.4686722295440646,-0.6796317033296327,-6.527118483266033,-0.5274763218306494,-2.088863927316735,-0.8467169354917643,"{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.8305}",-0.8305,-0.2576337712653247,-0.5055900248778588,-0.2693743697646523,0.11109668109668108,-0.19598663664205604,0.1569886537945943,-0.08230467403369736,-0.9994,-0.08992245780300429,-0.04824405817665835,0.04155423818792905,0.5887594921603532,-0.12634997524636193,0.8575771060021533,0.04678087826041046,66.25025260515024,-0.17403487188665645,1.051566109139722,-0.6100749160497279

I went there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn
how to read. This desire soon sprang up in the others also. They very
soon mustered up some old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that
I must keep a Sabbath school. I agreed to do so, and accordingly
devoted my Sundays to teaching these my loved fellow-slaves how to
read. Neither of them knew his letters when I went there. Some of the
slaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, and also
availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read. It was
understood, among all who came, that there must be as little display
about it as possible. It was necessary to keep our religious masters at
St. Michael’s unacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the
Sabbath in wrestling, boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to
learn how to read the will of God; for they had much rather see us
engaged in those degrading sports, than to see us behaving like
intellectual, moral, and accountable beings. My blood boils as I think
of the bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and Garrison
West, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in
upon us with sticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little

103,103,1101,1108,1116,"I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name
I deem it imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might
embarrass him greatly, though the crime of holding the school was
committed ten years ago. I had at one time over forty scholars, and
those of the right sort, ardently desiring to learn. They were of all
ages, though mostly men and women. I look back to those Sundays with an
amount of pleasure not to be expressed. They were great days to my
soul. The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest
engagement with which I was ever blessed. We loved each other, and to
leave them at the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. When
I think that these precious souls are to-day shut up in the
prison-house of slavery, my feelings overcome me, and I am almost ready
to ask, “Does a righteous God govern the universe? and for what does he
hold the thunders in his right hand, if not to smite the oppressor, and
deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?” These dear souls
came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nor did I
teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged. Every moment
they spent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given
thirty-nine lashes. They came because they wished to learn. Their minds
had been starved by their cruel masters. They had been shut up in
mental darkness. I taught them, because it was the delight of my soul
to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my
race. I kept up my school nearly the whole year I lived with Mr.
Freeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three evenings in
the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home. And I have
the happiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school
learned how to read; and that one, at least, is now free through my
agency.",i held my sabbath school at the house of a free colored man whose name i deem it imprudent to mention for should it be known it might embarrass him greatly though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago i had at one time over forty scholars and those of the right sort ardently desiring to learn they were of all ages though mostly men and women i look back to those sundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed they were great days to my soul the work of instructing my dear fellow slaves was the sweetest engagement with which i was ever blessed we loved each other and to leave them at the close of the sabbath was a severe cross indeed when i think that these precious souls are to day shut up in the prison house of slavery my feelings overcome me and i am almost ready to ask “does a righteous god govern the universe and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand if not to smite the oppressor and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler” these dear souls came not to sabbath school because it was popular to do so nor did i teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged every moment they spent in that school they were liable to be taken up and given thirty nine lashes they came because they wished to learn their minds had been starved by their cruel masters they had been shut up in mental darkness i taught them because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked like bettering the condition of my race i kept up my school nearly the whole year i lived with mr freeland and beside my sabbath school i devoted three evenings in the week during the winter to teaching the slaves at home and i have the happiness to know that several of those who came to sabbath school learned how to read and that one at least is now free through my agency,356,1875,6.1,0.4096879089284542,1.2761394101876677,0.39371852139497365,5.3500000000000005,0.4166577049435775,1.2721893491124263,0.4027520311697821,130.91040989855333,0.19329191655235256,1.3027013862079955,0.5819633414506014,3.579166666666667,0.4887276770157826,1.2303963048498847,0.38664454439552765,20.561,0.7036090036313832,2.2338287145352083,0.7552807443629654,18.89772025379405,-0.07794318963936273,0.24269631700186392,-0.005895603861527074,1.1715616992603686,0.13050365594943147,0.48079492054945416,0.2800609713729958,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.989}",0.989,0.04720638026806147,0.585139226088781,0.2806476290091509,0.2098571428571429,-0.1691553757976196,0.684083917516585,0.1491812430348629,0.9991,-0.03326535386741669,1.0424318498103529,0.49984529256059484,0.8915021792735675,-0.011351207750055162,1.536260996366467,0.41420872377077306,60.41911049042758,-0.1605006802762725,0.8759165047510727,-0.45055975186363056
104,104,1117,1123,1129,"The year passed off smoothly. It seemed only about half as long as the
year which preceded it. I went through it without receiving a single
blow. I will give Mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I
ever had, _till I became my own master._ For the ease with which I
passed the year, I was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of my
fellow-slaves. They were noble souls; they not only possessed loving
hearts, but brave ones. We were linked and interlinked with each other.
I loved them with a love stronger than any thing I have experienced
since. It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in
each other. In answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved any
or confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially
those with whom I lived at Mr. Freeland’s. I believe we would have died
for each other. We never undertook to do any thing, of any importance,
without a mutual consultation. We never moved separately. We were one;
and as much so by our tempers and dispositions, as by the mutual
hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as
slaves.",the year passed off smoothly it seemed only about half as long as the year which preceded it i went through it without receiving a single blow i will give mr freeland the credit of being the best master i ever had till i became my own master for the ease with which i passed the year i was however somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow slaves they were noble souls they not only possessed loving hearts but brave ones we were linked and interlinked with each other i loved them with a love stronger than any thing i have experienced since it is sometimes said that we slaves do not love and confide in each other in answer to this assertion i can say i never loved any or confided in any people more than my fellow slaves and especially those with whom i lived at mr freeland’s i believe we would have died for each other we never undertook to do any thing of any importance without a mutual consultation we never moved separately we were one and as much so by our tempers and dispositions as by the mutual hardships to which we were necessarily subjected by our condition as slaves,206,1121,4.8999999999999995,0.586374059226926,1.0187667560321716,0.5588593064067863,2.8999999999999995,0.39109229521046,0.6923076923076922,0.37761936311214267,94.81854321981307,0.2289027253430402,0.943547940812293,0.7284462338464389,1.416666666666667,0.32557710697981157,0.44072098899606044,0.2225877468030355,10.775,0.589989970297182,0.9439483309717596,0.6306520317675091,84.81279374157803,1.2201935447722663,1.6304256712260317,1.1818988772044385,2.2108094633772764,0.38793958505173043,0.8276741451533538,0.7209149899471375,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9846}",0.9846,0.17487044680907488,0.5825015735994964,0.5109914491958093,0.23638716356107664,-0.12262567197898049,0.825677506795328,0.5506148999112435,0.9024,-0.016162551887239036,0.9896580893388273,0.6381873645650779,1.3557648272582175,0.4205780497831415,2.577037845807687,1.794248179527634,39.42610209689476,-0.13139444931923278,0.2435509155225868,-0.10751117211776197
105,105,1130,1146,1162,"At the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again hired me of my
master, for the year 1835. But, by this time, I began to want to live
_upon free land_ as well as _with Freeland;_ and I was no longer
content, therefore, to live with him or any other slaveholder. I began,
with the commencement of the year, to prepare myself for a final
struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other. My tendency
was upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year had
passed, and I was still a slave. These thoughts roused me—I must do
something. I therefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without
witnessing an attempt, on my part, to secure my liberty. But I was not
willing to cherish this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear
to me. I was anxious to have them participate with me in this, my
life-giving determination. I therefore, though with great prudence,
commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to
their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom. I
bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhile
strove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud
and inhumanity of slavery. I went first to Henry, next to John, then to
the others. I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They
were ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible plan should be
proposed. This was what I wanted. I talked to them of our want of
manhood, if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble
effort to be free. We met often, and consulted frequently, and told our
hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties, real and imagined, which
we should be called on to meet. At times we were almost disposed to
give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; at others,
we were firm and unbending in our determination to go. Whenever we
suggested any plan, there was shrinking—the odds were fearful. Our path
was beset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining
the end of it, our right to be free was yet questionable—we were yet
liable to be returned to bondage. We could see no spot, this side of
the ocean, where we could be free. We knew nothing about Canada. Our
knowledge of the north did not extend farther than New York; and to go
there, and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being
returned to slavery—with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse
than before—the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which it was
not easy to overcome. The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate
through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman—at every ferry a
guard—on every bridge a sentinel—and in every wood a patrol. We were
hemmed in upon every side. Here were the difficulties, real or
imagined—the good to be sought, and the evil to be shunned. On the one
hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaring frightfully upon
us,—its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even
now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand,
away back in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north
star, behind some craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a
doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us to come and share its
hospitality. This in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us; but
when we permitted ourselves to survey the road, we were frequently
appalled. Upon either side we saw grim death, assuming the most horrid
shapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our own flesh;—now we
were contending with the waves, and were drowned;—now we were
overtaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound.
We were stung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes,
and finally, after having nearly reached the desired spot,—after
swimming rivers, encountering wild beasts, sleeping in the woods,
suffering hunger and nakedness,—we were overtaken by our pursuers, and,
in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot! I say, this picture
sometimes appalled us, and made us",at the close of the year  mr freeland again hired me of my master for the year  but by this time i began to want to live upon free land as well as with freeland and i was no longer content therefore to live with him or any other slaveholder i began with the commencement of the year to prepare myself for a final struggle which should decide my fate one way or the other my tendency was upward i was fast approaching manhood and year after year had passed and i was still a slave these thoughts roused me—i must do something i therefore resolved that  should not pass without witnessing an attempt on my part to secure my liberty but i was not willing to cherish this determination alone my fellow slaves were dear to me i was anxious to have them participate with me in this my life giving determination i therefore though with great prudence commenced early to ascertain their views and feelings in regard to their condition and to imbue their minds with thoughts of freedom i bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape and meanwhile strove on all fitting occasions to impress them with the gross fraud and inhumanity of slavery i went first to henry next to john then to the others i found in them all warm hearts and noble spirits they were ready to hear and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed this was what i wanted i talked to them of our want of manhood if we submitted to our enslavement without at least one noble effort to be free we met often and consulted frequently and told our hopes and fears recounted the difficulties real and imagined which we should be called on to meet at times we were almost disposed to give up and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot at others we were firm and unbending in our determination to go whenever we suggested any plan there was shrinking—the odds were fearful our path was beset with the greatest obstacles and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it our right to be free was yet questionable—we were yet liable to be returned to bondage we could see no spot this side of the ocean where we could be free we knew nothing about canada our knowledge of the north did not extend farther than new york and to go there and be forever harassed with the frightful liability of being returned to slavery—with the certainty of being treated tenfold worse than before—the thought was truly a horrible one and one which it was not easy to overcome the case sometimes stood thus at every gate through which we were to pass we saw a watchman—at every ferry a guard—on every bridge a sentinel—and in every wood a patrol we were hemmed in upon every side here were the difficulties real or imagined—the good to be sought and the evil to be shunned on the one hand there stood slavery a stern reality glaring frightfully upon us—its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions and even now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh on the other hand away back in the dim distance under the flickering light of the north star behind some craggy hill or snow covered mountain stood a doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us to come and share its hospitality this in itself was sometimes enough to stagger us but when we permitted ourselves to survey the road we were frequently appalled upon either side we saw grim death assuming the most horrid shapes now it was starvation causing us to eat our own flesh—now we were contending with the waves and were drowned—now we were overtaken and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound we were stung by scorpions chased by wild beasts bitten by snakes and finally after having nearly reached the desired spot—after swimming rivers encountering wild beasts sleeping in the woods suffering hunger and nakedness—we were overtaken by our pursuers and in our resistance we were shot dead upon the spot i say this picture sometimes appalled us and made us,704,4020,-4.849999999999996,-0.22846374732242566,-1.0723860589812324,-0.2027338054672877,-5.349999999999998,-0.19200149093814017,-1.2603550295857984,-0.19560448609380995,-119.09837202868167,-0.01327441244800098,-1.1851587238716124,-0.26773466797721795,2.5149571428571442,0.15586192482238467,0.8417812797174302,0.051929873640623736,8.344000000000001,-0.25339871536442654,0.6235212706363065,-0.2944609799090343,0.0,-0.2700905056822428,-0.15516292423780248,-0.18171030465328544,-3.7555704369926994,-0.16790581838383056,-1.163779004896255,-0.2309594460145824,"{'neg': 0.16, 'neu': 0.692, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': -0.9484}",-0.9484,-0.2159164445106284,-0.5762671222611876,-0.19410394580737725,0.025468975468975506,-0.2152919029536676,-0.30001567035705307,-0.24886029370085216,-0.9979,-0.07915829227104612,-0.047425437279995625,0.12862400399684482,0.4040243760702734,-0.21584689604442706,0.44344076972780333,-0.23916706278774635,106.65820041059266,-0.18496172359198135,2.2687616270233963,-0.7388597444302233

to Mr. Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter

Our reason for taking the water route was, that we were less liable to
be suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen;
whereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected to
interruptions of almost every kind. Any one having a white face, and
being so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination.",the plan we finally concluded upon was to get a large canoe belonging to mr hamilton and upon the saturday night previous to easter holidays paddle directly up the chesapeake bay on our arrival at the head of the bay a distance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived it was our purpose to turn our canoe adrift and follow the guidance of the north star till we got beyond the limits of maryland our reason for taking the water route was that we were less liable to be suspected as runaways we hoped to be regarded as fishermen whereas if we should take the land route we should be subjected to interruptions of almost every kind any one having a white face and being so disposed could stop us and subject us to examination,137,749,-1.0,-0.23935633820528612,-0.24664879356568356,-0.21291463178655154,-1.0,-0.1839274203953529,-0.2307692307692308,-0.1876670840750592,-50.67583895264562,-0.09050033491135875,-0.5042798789036113,-0.5853987950926779,-1.3041666666666667,-0.5164911812218473,-0.5528396685232987,-0.6241578495261564,5.857000000000002,0.39080509380596457,0.29571292055227866,0.41216614963042725,33.512107186038364,0.6153432485231638,0.5503772868732569,0.6284611501059716,-0.19920394415344003,-0.03365305906614205,0.02326194341084929,-0.0010542084035922927,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.3089}",0.3089,0.013825580533361562,0.17744207655186883,0.22041877103754326,0.03492063492063492,-0.19705458060083214,-0.24957114182329368,-0.09151832925878803,-0.9999,-0.14305598286088245,-0.048516931808879296,-0.3882351003034139,0.06374988443447606,-0.2273487257238854,-0.3193813416078199,-0.27591608706477816,27.888552181481607,-0.1150402006523923,-0.10399096193223865,0.08524143079572015

strength of our determination was about to be fully tested. At this

prepared to acknowledge. Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting,
we pledged ourselves afresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the
time appointed, we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom. This
was in the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to be off.
We went, as usual, to our several fields of labor, but with bosoms

tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I think we
succeeded very well.",as the time drew near for our departure our anxiety became more and more intense it was truly a matter of life and death with us the strength of our determination was about to be fully tested at this time i was very active in explaining every difficulty removing every doubt dispelling every fear and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move we had talked long enough we were now ready to move if not now we never should be and if we did not intend to move now we had as well fold our arms sit down and acknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves this none of us were prepared to acknowledge every man stood firm and at our last meeting we pledged ourselves afresh in the most solemn manner that at the time appointed we would certainly start in pursuit of freedom this was in the middle of the week at the end of which we were to be off we went as usual to our several fields of labor but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardous undertaking we tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible and i think we succeeded very well,218,1188,1.4000000000000008,0.1251229245595901,0.2680965147453086,0.12774812798177312,1.4000000000000008,0.18516242009801934,0.33727810650887596,0.1751752306542277,15.662945779820943,0.07945626216826142,0.1558633969237835,0.11370731250258286,3.6330750000000007,0.828279345838565,1.2500818910474125,0.7280822690199054,7.1610000000000005,0.18433997206070213,0.4675915246976634,0.18569456679897348,0.0,-0.2700905056822428,-0.15516292423780248,-0.18171030465328544,0.9116609537902104,0.161329736514856,0.394045473328587,0.3328500344285935,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9436}",0.9436,0.14609316253017604,0.5579234481311632,0.4590686977513416,0.13995296884185776,-0.164777792256893,0.3109977818196598,0.18694871681645553,0.9919,-0.014321834449037311,1.0385024695063716,0.6530766595864872,0.7820435665667235,0.10339480828643208,1.2908783652808786,0.7808290134581215,41.38940730207555,-0.13344816505502907,0.3026909220255124,-0.13171644511949585

witness our departure, came. I hailed it with joy, bring what of
sadness it might. Friday night was a sleepless one for me. I probably
felt more anxious than the rest, because I was, by common consent, at
the head of the whole affair. The responsibility of success or failure
lay heavily upon me. The glory of the one, and the confusion of the
other, were alike mine. The first two hours of that morning were such
as I never experienced before, and hope never to again. Early in the
morning, we went, as usual, to the field. We were spreading manure; and
all at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an
indescribable feeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who
was near by, and said, “We are betrayed!” “Well,” said he, “that
thought has this moment struck me.” We said no more. I was never more
certain of any thing.",after a painful waiting the saturday morning whose night was to witness our departure came i hailed it with joy bring what of sadness it might friday night was a sleepless one for me i probably felt more anxious than the rest because i was by common consent at the head of the whole affair the responsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me the glory of the one and the confusion of the other were alike mine the first two hours of that morning were such as i never experienced before and hope never to again early in the morning we went as usual to the field we were spreading manure and all at once while thus engaged i was overwhelmed with an indescribable feeling in the fulness of which i turned to sandy who was near by and said “we are betrayed” “well” said he “that thought has this moment struck me” we said no more i was never more certain of any thing,167,906,-0.1499999999999999,-0.06932449280446679,-0.06434316353887388,-0.05399333331994877,0.6500000000000001,0.11711308859421542,0.15976331360946747,0.1082777594975699,-49.03568215305088,-0.06115635907364284,-0.48795852953127117,-0.46469413824629235,-2.929566666666667,-0.9285177304755879,-1.146383371824481,-1.038473019732124,4.2860000000000005,0.03456660320083645,0.08864138135565283,0.021408165178350796,0.0,-0.2700905056822428,-0.15516292423780248,-0.18171030465328544,0.9582226770951671,0.2151588416043728,0.4095868052745538,0.4250313293151096,"{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.5067}",0.5067,0.06353762594338586,0.2960165452747055,0.3101140373665296,-0.030388471177944864,-0.2334814295131315,-0.5981329031683574,-0.40578990133550485,0.9293,-0.003297458318763284,1.0043386907523126,0.7422512309921856,0.41392777083299276,-0.014064318285313453,0.46564204748439014,0.40554017557408534,33.15450462749278,-0.12180378673221604,0.05463361721082946,0.005525214632346498

for breakfast. I went for the form, more than for want of any thing to
eat that morning. Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the
lane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men. The white men
were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if
tied. I watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate.
Here they halted, and tied the colored men to the gate-post. I was not
yet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode Mr.
Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement. He came to the
door, and inquired if Master William was in. He was told he was at the
barn. Mr. Hamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with
extraordinary speed. In a few moments, he and Mr. Freeland returned to
the house. By this time, the three constables rode up, and in great
haste dismounted, tied their horses, and met Master William and Mr.
Hamilton returning from the barn; and after talking awhile, they all
walked up to the kitchen door. There was no one in the kitchen but
myself and John. Henry and Sandy were up at the barn. Mr. Freeland put
his head in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some
gentlemen at the door who wished to see me. I stepped to the door, and
inquired what they wanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving
me any satisfaction, tied me—lashing my hands closely together. I
insisted upon knowing what the matter was. They at length said, that
they had learned I had been in a “scrape,” and that I was to be
examined before my master; and if their information proved false, I
should not be hurt.",the horn was blown as usual and we went up from the field to the house for breakfast i went for the form more than for want of any thing to eat that morning just as i got to the house in looking out at the lane gate i saw four white men with two colored men the white men were on horseback and the colored ones were walking behind as if tied i watched them a few moments till they got up to our lane gate here they halted and tied the colored men to the gate post i was not yet certain as to what the matter was in a few moments in rode mr hamilton with a speed betokening great excitement he came to the door and inquired if master william was in he was told he was at the barn mr hamilton without dismounting rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed in a few moments he and mr freeland returned to the house by this time the three constables rode up and in great haste dismounted tied their horses and met master william and mr hamilton returning from the barn and after talking awhile they all walked up to the kitchen door there was no one in the kitchen but myself and john henry and sandy were up at the barn mr freeland put his head in at the door and called me by name saying there were some gentlemen at the door who wished to see me i stepped to the door and inquired what they wanted they at once seized me and without giving me any satisfaction tied me—lashing my hands closely together i insisted upon knowing what the matter was they at length said that they had learned i had been in a “scrape” and that i was to be examined before my master and if their information proved false i should not be hurt,323,1675,6.600000000000001,0.4973089185444553,1.3833780160857914,0.4756140309585161,4.400000000000001,0.3788430287074379,1.0473372781065093,0.3655774380194571,59.017485837899535,0.1221116367646987,0.5872883651584386,0.28916759715492185,3.432638888888888,0.5181820394724143,1.1768890820993523,0.41626251250129737,8.381,0.04046037715687344,0.6283981942201862,0.027873045567791785,69.71886421790032,0.5112182403243676,1.3126487506787101,0.5331868182109303,1.5312236085215385,0.18065856256951596,0.60084256319229,0.3659502728849408,"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': 0.8918}",0.8918,0.04611573497616614,0.5268710847345862,0.27867978159671514,0.07673992673992674,-0.19849795901917264,-0.026377059320722762,-0.10397103428758638,0.5199,-0.046269247731392904,0.7809097606898247,0.3946586907772206,0.17237024477371468,-0.22011031893027083,-0.07587789176151521,-0.2527889503918501,55.12404990677539,-0.1592300625952767,0.7164151106100943,-0.4355841409193981

Henry, who had by this time returned, and commanded him to cross his
hands. “I won’t!” said Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his readiness
to meet the consequences of his refusal. “Won’t you?” said Tom Graham,
the constable. “No, I won’t!” said Henry, in a still stronger tone.
With this, two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols, and
swore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross his hands or
kill him. Each cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger,
walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his
hands, they would blow his damned heart out. “Shoot me, shoot me!” said
Henry; “you can’t kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,—and be damned! _I
won’t be tied!_” This he said in a tone of loud defiance; and at the
same time, with a motion as quick as lightning, he with one single
stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable. As he did
this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him some time, they
finally overpowered him, and got him tied.",in a few moments they succeeded in tying john they then turned to henry who had by this time returned and commanded him to cross his hands “i will not” said henry in a firm tone indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of his refusal “will not you” said tom graham the constable “no i will not” said henry in a still stronger tone with this two of the constables pulled out their shining pistols and swore by their creator that they would make him cross his hands or kill him each cocked his pistol and with fingers on the trigger walked up to henry saying at the same time if he did not cross his hands they would blow his damned heart out “shoot me shoot me” said henry “you cannot kill me but once shoot shoot—and be damned i will not be tied” this he said in a tone of loud defiance and at the same time with a motion as quick as lightning he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of each constable as he did this all hands fell upon him and after beating him some time they finally overpowered him and got him tied,204,1082,-5.45,-0.7551155617717854,-1.2010723860589811,-0.6949721270286751,-6.45,-0.8380690437590673,-1.5207100591715976,-0.8307361549137231,-94.9649580230486,-0.12728827063360892,-0.9450049278256566,-0.7367237274058286,-1.2883928571428567,-0.3519541279984416,-0.5470795815785898,-0.45870686745979944,-5.3549999999999995,-1.0477671630775194,-1.1821267341088078,-1.165803694766766,-97.9232438838966,-2.0076133735359925,-2.2167696677047593,-1.771542884268255,-2.7684879657597494,-0.45285330911407784,-0.8343114668714444,-0.7189264784684284,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.044, 'compound': -0.8807}",-0.8807,-0.40535330211011217,-0.535683241914696,-0.5359041927045941,-0.0034632034632034684,-0.21972404148493296,-0.45442983785352337,-0.2870984390654451,-0.9856,-0.11625025695107036,-0.040712745927361044,-0.17140749110547696,-0.007149846125697443,-0.28035788514254756,-0.47832326493284366,-0.44528347822520864,36.35947528364471,-0.14906337105970643,0.15117590974198866,-0.3157586266802148

without being discovered, put it into the fire. We were all now tied;
and just as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of
William Freeland, came to the door with her hands full of biscuits, and
divided them between Henry and John. She then delivered herself of a
speech, to the following effect:—addressing herself to me, she said,
“_You devil! You yellow devil!_ it was you that put it into the heads
of Henry and John to run away. But for you, you long-legged mulatto
devil! Henry nor John would never have thought of such a thing.” I made
no reply, and was immediately hurried off towards St. Michael’s. Just a
moment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the
propriety of making a search for the protections which he had
understood Frederick had written for himself and the rest. But, just at
the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect, his aid was
needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending the
scuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under the

119,119,1235,1243,1251,"When we got about half way to St. Michael’s, while the constables
having us in charge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he
should do with his pass. I told him to eat it with his biscuit, and own
nothing; and we passed the word around, “_Own nothing;_” and “_Own
nothing!_” said we all. Our confidence in each other was unshaken. We
were resolved to succeed or fail together, after the calamity had
befallen us as much as before. We were now prepared for any thing. We
were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses, and then
to be placed in the Easton jail. When we reached St. Michael’s, we
underwent a sort of examination. We all denied that we ever intended to
run away. We did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than
from any hope of getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we
were ready for that. The fact was, we cared but little where we went,
so we went together. Our greatest concern was about separation. We
dreaded that more than any thing this side of death. We found the
evidence against us to be the testimony of one person; our master would
not tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision among
ourselves as to who their informant was. We were sent off to the jail
at Easton. When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr.

that which was very good; but we had a good clean room, from the
windows of which we could see what was going on in the street, which
was very much better than though we had been placed in one of the dark,
damp cells. Upon the whole, we got along very well, so far as the jail
and its keeper were concerned. Immediately after the holidays were
over, contrary to all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland
came up to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of
jail, and carried them home, leaving me alone. I regarded this
separation as a final one. It caused me more pain than any thing else
in the whole transaction. I was ready for any thing rather than
separation. I supposed that they had consulted together, and had
decided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of the others
to run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty;
and that they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and
sell me, as a warning to the others that remained. It is due to the
noble Henry to say, he seemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison
as at leaving home to come to the prison. But we knew we should, in all

124,124,1280,1288,1297,"In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr.
William Gardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell’s Point. I was put
there to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable
place for the accomplishment of this object. Mr. Gardner was engaged
that spring in building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for the
Mexican government. The vessels were to be launched in the July of that
year, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable
sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was no time to learn
any thing. Every man had to do that which he knew how to do. In
entering the shipyard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever
the carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck and
call of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters.
Their word was to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At
times I needed a dozen pair of hands. I was called a dozen ways in the
space of a single minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear at
the same moment. It was—“Fred., come help me to cant this timber
here.”—“Fred., come carry this timber yonder.”—“Fred., bring that
roller here.”—“Fred., go get a fresh can of water.”—“Fred., come help
saw off the end of this timber.”—“Fred., go quick, and get the
crowbar.”—“Fred., hold on the end of this fall.”—“Fred., go to the
blacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”—“Hurra, Fred! run and bring me
a cold chisel.”—“I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fire as quick
as lightning under that steam-box.”—“Halloo, nigger! come, turn this
grindstone.”—“Come, come! move, move! and _bowse_ this timber
forward.”—“I say, darky, blast your eyes, why don’t you heat up some

125,125,1298,1312,1326,"This was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there
longer, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white
apprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was
horribly mangled in other respects. The facts in the case were these:
Until a very little while after I went there, white and black
ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any
impropriety in it. All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of
the black carpenters were freemen. Things seemed to be going on very
well. All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they
would not work with free colored workmen. Their reason for this, as
alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they
would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men
would be thrown out of employment. They therefore felt called upon at
once to put a stop to it. And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner’s
necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless
he would discharge his black carpenters. Now, though this did not
extend to me in form, it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices
very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me. They
began to put on airs, and talk about the “niggers” taking the country,
saying we all ought to be killed; and, being encouraged by the
journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as they could,
by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me. I, of course, kept
the vow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again,
regardless of consequences; and while I kept them from combining, I
succeeded very well; for I could whip the whole of them, taking them
separately. They, however, at length combined, and came upon me, armed
with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. One came in front with a
half brick. There was one at each side of me, and one behind me. While
I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the one behind
ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head. It
stunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to
beating me with their fists. I let them lay on for a while, gathering
strength. In an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands
and knees. Just as I did that, one of their number gave me, with his
heavy boot, a powerful kick in the left eye. My eyeball seemed to have
burst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly swollen, they left me.
With this I seized the handspike, and for a time pursued them. But here
the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well give it up. It
was impossible to stand my hand against so many. All this took place in
sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one
interposed a friendly word; but some cried, “Kill the damned nigger!
Kill him! kill him! He struck a white person.” I found my only chance
for life was in flight. I succeeded in getting away without an
additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a white man is death by
Lynch law,—and that was the law in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard; nor is
there much of any other out of Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard.",this was my school for eight months and i might have remained there longer but for a most horrid fight i had with four of the white apprentices in which my left eye was nearly knocked out and i was horribly mangled in other respects the facts in the case were these until a very little while after i went there white and black ship carpenters worked side by side and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it all hands seemed to be very well satisfied many of the black carpenters were freemen things seemed to be going on very well all at once the white carpenters knocked off and said they would not work with free colored workmen their reason for this as alleged was that if free colored carpenters were encouraged they would soon take the trade into their own hands and poor white men would be thrown out of employment they therefore felt called upon at once to put a stop to it and taking advantage of mr gardner’s necessities they broke off swearing they would work no longer unless he would discharge his black carpenters now though this did not extend to me in form it did reach me in fact my fellow apprentices very soon began to feel it degrading to them to work with me they began to put on airs and talk about the “niggers” taking the country saying we all ought to be killed and being encouraged by the journeymen they commenced making my condition as hard as they could by hectoring me around and sometimes striking me i of course kept the vow i made after the fight with mr covey and struck back again regardless of consequences and while i kept them from combining i succeeded very well for i could whip the whole of them taking them separately they however at length combined and came upon me armed with sticks stones and heavy handspikes one came in front with a half brick there was one at each side of me and one behind me while i was attending to those in front and on either side the one behind ran up with the handspike and struck me a heavy blow upon the head it stunned me i fell and with this they all ran upon me and fell to beating me with their fists i let them lay on for a while gathering strength in an instant i gave a sudden surge and rose to my hands and knees just as i did that one of their number gave me with his heavy boot a powerful kick in the left eye my eyeball seemed to have burst when they saw my eye closed and badly swollen they left me with this i seized the handspike and for a time pursued them but here the carpenters interfered and i thought i might as well give it up it was impossible to stand my hand against so many all this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship carpenters and not one interposed a friendly word but some cried “kill the damned nigger kill him kill him he struck a white person” i found my only chance for life was in flight i succeeded in getting away without an additional blow and barely so for to strike a white man is death by lynch law—and that was the law in mr gardner’s ship yard nor is there much of any other out of mr gardner’s ship yard,591,3142,-2.6999999999999993,-0.16681949934693302,-0.6112600536193027,-0.1451176341661478,-2.6999999999999993,-0.11047300743086587,-0.6331360946745561,-0.11545602242272958,-81.28081200956758,-0.0011001736030705957,-0.8088327472126057,-0.21765667819593817,-7.174822222222223,-0.6510801793854923,-2.696613902096636,-0.7594944286447045,-6.075000000000006,-0.7148025293631491,-1.2770290308761991,-0.8005748028998568,-48.834634643068846,-0.5691897850942479,-1.183292795162679,-0.45538599994697854,-3.0855550275250834,-0.16397183210394844,-0.9401418379630327,-0.22422257107040006,"{'neg': 0.165, 'neu': 0.752, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.9961}",-0.9961,-0.2374937207197305,-0.6048616731109312,-0.23303574835677004,0.010918209876543215,-0.21676806427301673,-0.3776746797478988,-0.26159583224791694,-0.9951,-0.08205147072623642,-0.045897344939558465,0.10522150523473275,0.09321816080293448,-0.2599352591136039,-0.2533198137843682,-0.38003198340619143,92.72092857712876,-0.17772946159457279,1.8489337038410723,-0.6536196729753185
126,126,1327,1337,1348,"I went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh;
and I am happy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was
heavenly, compared with that of his brother Thomas under similar
circumstances. He listened attentively to my narration of the
circumstances leading to the savage outrage, and gave many proofs of
his strong indignation at it. The heart of my once overkind mistress
was again melted into pity. My puffed-out eye and blood-covered face
moved her to tears. She took a chair by me, washed the blood from my
face, and, with a mother’s tenderness, bound up my head, covering the
wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation
for my suffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness
from this, my once affectionate old mistress. Master Hugh was very much
enraged. He gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon
the heads of those who did the deed. As soon as I got a little the
better of my bruises, he took me with him to Esquire Watson’s, on Bond
Street, to see what could be done about the matter. Mr. Watson inquired
who saw the assault committed. Master Hugh told him it was done in Mr.
Gardner’s ship-yard at midday, where there were a large company of men
at work. “As to that,” he said, “the deed was done, and there was no
question as to who did it.” His answer was, he could do nothing in the
case, unless some white man would come forward and testify. He could
issue no warrant on my word. If I had been killed in the presence of a
thousand colored people, their testimony combined would have been
insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers. Master Hugh, for
once, was compelled to say this state of things was too bad. Of course,
it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my
behalf, and against the white young men. Even those who may have
sympathized with me were not prepared to do this. It required a degree
of courage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the
slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was
denounced as abolitionism, and that name subjected its bearer to
frightful liabilities. The watchwords of the bloody-minded in that
region, and in those days, were, “Damn the abolitionists!” and “Damn
the niggers!” There was nothing done, and probably nothing would have
been done if I had been killed. Such was, and such remains, the state
of things in the Christian city of Baltimore.",i went directly home and told the story of my wrongs to master hugh and i am happy to say of him irreligious as he was his conduct was heavenly compared with that of his brother thomas under similar circumstances he listened attentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it the heart of my once overkind mistress was again melted into pity my puffed out eye and blood covered face moved her to tears she took a chair by me washed the blood from my face and with a mother’s tenderness bound up my head covering the wounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef it was almost compensation for my suffering to witness once more a manifestation of kindness from this my once affectionate old mistress master hugh was very much enraged he gave expression to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed as soon as i got a little the better of my bruises he took me with him to esquire watson’s on bond street to see what could be done about the matter mr watson inquired who saw the assault committed master hugh told him it was done in mr gardner’s ship yard at midday where there were a large company of men at work “as to that” he said “the deed was done and there was no question as to who did it” his answer was he could do nothing in the case unless some white man would come forward and testify he could issue no warrant on my word if i had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one of the murderers master hugh for once was compelled to say this state of things was too bad of course it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf and against the white young men even those who may have sympathized with me were not prepared to do this it required a degree of courage unknown to them to do so for just at that time the slightest manifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities the watchwords of the bloody minded in that region and in those days were “damn the abolitionists” and “damn the niggers” there was nothing done and probably nothing would have been done if i had been killed such was and such remains the state of things in the christian city of baltimore,447,2456,0.4499999999999993,-0.018724141416067087,0.06434316353887394,-0.006699407134800765,-2.55,-0.14103492087591274,-0.5976331360946746,-0.14550061915867266,-126.71489970987935,-0.05725190450623798,-1.2609514830271045,-0.4486334022595499,-0.9116071428571451,-0.1323397514577715,-0.40948958022007975,-0.23787263247925086,7.2930000000000055,-0.16034924563458824,0.484990279105019,-0.19239502071354386,24.840772828102182,-0.06893474018782153,0.36781714407024885,0.0023471230083447108,-1.7734616823374518,-0.12060804608826887,-0.502192450048427,-0.14996293143010406,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.978}",-0.978,-0.2695430850454944,-0.5940113299163744,-0.29086230216608966,0.04642416225749559,-0.2096485723663543,-0.18817557251072517,-0.20017262434758204,-0.9981,-0.08801775226931495,-0.04753458673288398,0.056961123585677675,0.22796548440129505,-0.22261726348721736,0.04875465965027931,-0.2607987861268493,71.7445862400151,-0.17287548779066722,1.2170701408296036,-0.5964103138517969
127,127,1349,1357,1365,"Master Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back
again to Mr. Gardner. He kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound
till I was again restored to health. He then took me into the ship-yard
of which he was foreman, in the employment of Mr. Walter Price. There I
was immediately set to calking, and very soon learned the art of using
my mallet and irons. In the course of one year from the time I left Mr.
Gardner’s, I was able to command the highest wages given to the most
experienced calkers. I was now of some importance to my master. I was
bringing him from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimes brought
him nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day.
After learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own
contracts, and collected the money which I earned. My pathway became
much more smooth than before; my condition was now much more
comfortable. When I could get no calking to do, I did nothing. During
these leisure times, those old notions about freedom would steal over
me again. When in Mr. Gardner’s employment, I was kept in such a
perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, but
my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty. I have
observed this in my experience of slavery,—that whenever my condition
was improved, instead of its increasing my contentment, it only
increased my desire to be free, and set me to thinking of plans to gain
my freedom. I have found that, to make a contented slave, it is
necessary to make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his
moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate the
power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in
slavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be
brought to that only when he ceases to be a man.",master hugh finding he could get no redress refused to let me go back again to mr gardner he kept me himself and his wife dressed my wound till i was again restored to health he then took me into the ship yard of which he was foreman in the employment of mr walter price there i was immediately set to calking and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons in the course of one year from the time i left mr gardner’s i was able to command the highest wages given to the most experienced calkers i was now of some importance to my master i was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week i sometimes brought him nine dollars per week my wages were a dollar and a half a day after learning how to calk i sought my own employment made my own contracts and collected the money which i earned my pathway became much more smooth than before my condition was now much more comfortable when i could get no calking to do i did nothing during these leisure times those old notions about freedom would steal over me again when in mr gardner’s employment i was kept in such a perpetual whirl of excitement i could think of nothing scarcely but my life and in thinking of my life i almost forgot my liberty i have observed this in my experience of slavery—that whenever my condition was improved instead of its increasing my contentment it only increased my desire to be free and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom i have found that to make a contented slave it is necessary to make a thoughtless one it is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision and as far as possible to annihilate the power of reason he must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery he must be made to feel that slavery is right and he can be brought to that only when he ceases to be a man,347,1841,10.799999999999995,0.7812807410887415,2.284182305630026,0.7410300220646634,8.799999999999997,0.694582636695138,2.088757396449704,0.6759725712499854,72.99989649547312,0.13275262392451698,0.7264286043515317,0.33293864954182417,6.650000000000001,0.9566084371969817,2.3517656840103256,0.8571241703848497,17.973000000000006,0.5793482322105894,1.8927076811546444,0.6189791097350801,75.71300460182907,0.5197072786410243,1.4388451443709676,0.540954284144827,-0.33617260344254807,-0.016865425533347186,-0.02245533784749826,0.02769428731373119,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.9612}",0.9612,0.04669221704814752,0.5684740580883014,0.2797199261442543,0.22848324514991183,-0.16340472005147402,0.7834934395572192,0.19879485705248837,-0.8268,-0.08964557642679633,0.045951919666002705,0.0437938912768472,1.095526849956564,0.05781809189696087,1.9936403588534366,0.6352087161887786,60.00680971449483,-0.15618464084411618,0.8634969020802904,-0.39969053422037926

succeeded in making, my escape from slavery. But before narrating any
of the peculiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make known my
intention not to state all the facts connected with the transaction. My
reasons for pursuing this course may be understood from the following:
First, were I to give a minute statement of all the facts, it is not
only possible, but quite probable, that others would thereby be
involved in the most embarrassing difficulties. Secondly, such a
statement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part
of slaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of
course, be the means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother
bondman might escape his galling chains. I deeply regret the necessity
that impels me to suppress any thing of importance connected with my
experience in slavery. It would afford me great pleasure indeed, as
well as materially add to the interest of my narrative, were I at
liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in the minds of
many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my most
fortunate escape. But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the
curious of the gratification which such a statement would afford. I
would allow myself to suffer under the greatest imputations which
evil-minded men might suggest, rather than exculpate myself, and
thereby run the hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a

western friends have conducted what they call the _underground

subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their
participation in the escape of slaves. I, however, can see very little
good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or the slaves
escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that those
open declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are
seeking to escape. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave,
whilst they do much towards enlightening the master. They stimulate him
to greater watchfulness, and enhance his power to capture his slave. We
owe something to the slave south of the line as well as to those north
of it; and in aiding the latter on their way to freedom, we should be
careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinder the former from
escaping from slavery. I would keep the merciless slaveholder
profoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. I
would leave him to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible
tormentors, ever ready to snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling
prey. Let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let darkness
commensurate with his crime hover over him; and let him feel that at
every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman, he is running
the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by an invisible
agency. Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light by

131,131,1390,1399,1408,"In the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless. I could
see no reason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of
my toil into the purse of my master. When I carried to him my weekly
wages, he would, after counting the money, look me in the face with a
robber-like fierceness, and ask, “Is this all?” He was satisfied with
nothing less than the last cent. He would, however, when I made him six
dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourage me. It had the
opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to
the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to
my mind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always
felt worse for having received any thing; for I feared that the giving
me a few cents would ease his conscience, and make him feel himself to
be a pretty honorable sort of robber. My discontent grew upon me. I was
ever on the look-out for means of escape; and, finding no direct means,
I determined to try to hire my time, with a view of getting money with
which to make my escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master Thomas came
to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got an opportunity, and
applied to him to allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatingly refused
my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape.
He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in
the event of my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts
to catch me. He exhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He told
me, if I would be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future. He
said, if I behaved myself properly, he would take care of me. Indeed,
he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me
to depend solely upon him for happiness. He seemed to see fully the
pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, in order to
contentment in slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite of
myself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of my
enslavement, and the means of escape.",in the early part of the year  i became quite restless i could see no reason why i should at the end of each week pour the reward of my toil into the purse of my master when i carried to him my weekly wages he would after counting the money look me in the face with a robber like fierceness and ask “is this all” he was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent he would however when i made him six dollars sometimes give me six cents to encourage me it had the opposite effect i regarded it as a sort of admission of my right to the whole the fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof to my mind that he believed me entitled to the whole of them i always felt worse for having received any thing for i feared that the giving me a few cents would ease his conscience and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort of robber my discontent grew upon me i was ever on the look out for means of escape and finding no direct means i determined to try to hire my time with a view of getting money with which to make my escape in the spring of  when master thomas came to baltimore to purchase his spring goods i got an opportunity and applied to him to allow me to hire my time he unhesitatingly refused my request and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape he told me i could go nowhere but that he could get me and that in the event of my running away he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me he exhorted me to content myself and be obedient he told me if i would be happy i must lay out no plans for the future he said if i behaved myself properly he would take care of me indeed he advised me to complete thoughtlessness of the future and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness he seemed to see fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature in order to contentment in slavery but in spite of him and even in spite of myself i continued to think and to think about the injustice of my enslavement and the means of escape,402,2068,9.399999999999999,0.5756605653927503,1.9839142091152813,0.5488458742333746,7.399999999999999,0.5075730589379255,1.7573964497041419,0.4921284752454192,57.171834371691254,0.1065304012769184,0.568922119683006,0.22507513425226572,7.858166666666668,0.9762992431502796,2.7929492188561347,0.8769243498509771,12.416999999999998,0.14346549948028348,1.1603782910996134,0.14085935964902455,93.77079315401465,0.5742476997934163,1.819021057409816,0.5908587429915194,0.16402983004932,0.030767591125972705,0.14450180006088242,0.10926490134688592,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': -0.3811}",-0.3811,-0.19045731466303764,-0.23618979108593352,-0.14816812857537448,0.14852607709750565,-0.18750116932506403,0.35675338761956094,-0.00909655328910359,-1.0,-0.09078480491973526,-0.04857150653532347,0.034578838071975836,0.5442560051784622,-0.13321765248551554,0.7578098747350532,0.024838244381975256,69.71267777096101,-0.15553417119424118,1.15586362043934,-0.39202404212503483
132,132,1409,1432,1456,"About two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege
of hiring my time. He was not acquainted with the fact that I had
applied to Master Thomas, and had been refused. He too, at first,
seemed disposed to refuse; but, after some reflection, he granted me
the privilege, and proposed the following terms: I was to be allowed
all my time, make all contracts with those for whom I worked, and find
my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was to pay him
three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools,
and in board and clothing. My board was two dollars and a half per
week. This, with the wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made
my regular expenses about six dollars per week. This amount I was
compelled to make up, or relinquish the privilege of hiring my time.
Rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of each week the money must
be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege. This arrangement, it
will be perceived, was decidedly in my master’s favor. It relieved him
of all need of looking after me. His money was sure. He received all
the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all the
evils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I
found it a hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than
the old mode of getting along. It was a step towards freedom to be
allowed to bear the responsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined
to hold on upon it. I bent myself to the work of making money. I was
ready to work at night as well as day, and by the most untiring
perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay
up a little money every week. I went on thus from May till August.
Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. The ground
for his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay
him for my week’s time. This failure was occasioned by my attending a
camp meeting about ten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had
entered into an engagement with a number of young friends to start from
Baltimore to the camp ground early Saturday evening; and being detained
by my employer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh’s without
disappointing the company. I knew that Master Hugh was in no special
need of the money that night. I therefore decided to go to camp
meeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. I staid at the
camp meeting one day longer than I intended when I left. But as soon as
I returned, I called upon him to pay him what he considered his due. I
found him very angry; he could scarce restrain his wrath. He said he
had a great mind to give me a severe whipping. He wished to know how I
dared go out of the city without asking his permission. I told him I
hired my time and while I paid him the price which he asked for it, I
did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where I should go.
This reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, he turned
to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing he
should know of, I would be running away. Upon the same plea, he told me
to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith. I did so; but instead of
seeking work, as I had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my
time, I spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke
of work. I did this in retaliation. Saturday night, he called upon me
as usual for my week’s wages. I told him I had no wages; I had done no
work that week. Here we were upon the point of coming to blows. He
raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. I did not allow
myself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his
hand upon me, it should be blow for blow. He did not strike me, but
told me that he would find me in constant employment in future. I
thought the matter over during the next day, Sunday, and finally
resolved upon the third day of September, as the day upon which I would
make a second attempt to secure my freedom. I now had three weeks
during which to prepare for my journey. Early on Monday morning, before
Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and got
employment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard near the drawbridge, upon
what is called the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to
seek employment for me. At the end of the week, I brought him between
eight and nine dollars. He seemed very well pleased, and asked why I
did not do the same the week before. He little knew what my plans were.
My object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might
entertain of my intent to run away; and in this I succeeded admirably.
I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with my condition
than at the very time during which I was planning my escape. The second
week passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleased
was he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a
slaveholder to give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. I
told him I would.",about two months after this i applied to master hugh for the privilege of hiring my time he was not acquainted with the fact that i had applied to master thomas and had been refused

without disappointing the company i knew that master hugh was in no special need of the money that night i therefore decided to go to camp meeting and upon my return pay him the three dollars i staid at the camp meeting one day longer than i intended when i left but as soon as i returned i called upon him to pay him what he considered his due i found him very angry he could scarce restrain his wrath he said he had a great mind to give me a severe whipping he wished to know how i dared go out of the city without asking his permission i told him i hired my time and while i paid him the price which he asked for it i did not know that i was bound to ask him when and where i should go this reply troubled him and after reflecting a few moments he turned to me and said i should hire my time no longer that the next thing he should know of i would be running away upon the same plea he told me to bring my tools and clothing home forthwith i did so but instead of seeking work as i had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time i spent the whole week without the performance of a single stroke of work i did this in retaliation saturday night he called upon me as usual for my week’s wages i told him i had no wages i had done no work that week here we were upon the point of coming to blows he raved and swore his determination to get hold of me i did not allow myself a single word but was resolved if he laid the weight of his hand upon me it should be blow for blow he did not strike me but told me that he would find me in constant employment in future i thought the matter over during the next day sunday and finally resolved upon the third day of september as the day upon which i would make a second attempt to secure my freedom i now had three weeks during which to prepare for my journey early on monday morning before master hugh had time to make any engagement for me i went out and got employment of mr butler at his ship yard near the drawbridge upon what is called the city block thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment for me at the end of the week i brought him between eight and nine dollars he seemed very well pleased and asked why i did not do the same the week before he little knew what my plans were my object in working steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away and in this i succeeded admirably i suppose he thought i was never better satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which i was planning my escape the second week passed and again i carried him my full wages and so well pleased was he that he gave me twenty five cents quite a large sum for a slaveholder to give a slave and bade me to make a good use of it i told him i

133,133,1457,1463,1470,"Things went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was
trouble. It is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of
my contemplated start drew near. I had a number of warmhearted friends
in Baltimore,—friends that I loved almost as I did my life,—and the
thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond
expression. It is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery,
who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to
their friends. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most
painful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my
tender point, and shook my decision more than all things else. Besides
the pain of separation, the dread and apprehension of a failure
exceeded what I had experienced at my first attempt. The appalling
defeat I then sustained returned to torment me. I felt assured that, if
I failed in this attempt, my case would be a hopeless one—it would seal
my fate as a slave forever. I could not hope to get off with any thing
less than the severest punishment, and being placed beyond the means of
escape. It required no very vivid imagination to depict the most
frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed.
The wretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were
perpetually before me. It was life and death with me. But I remained
firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third day of September,
1838, I left my chains, and succeeded in reaching New York without the
slightest interruption of any kind. How I did so,—what means I
adopted,—what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,—I
must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.",things went on without very smoothly indeed but within there was trouble it is impossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated start drew near i had a number of warmhearted friends in baltimore—friends that i loved almost as i did my life—and the thought of being separated from them forever was painful beyond expression it is my opinion that thousands would escape from slavery who now remain but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to their friends the thought of leaving my friends was decidedly the most painful thought with which i had to contend the love of them was my tender point and shook my decision more than all things else besides the pain of separation the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what i had experienced at my first attempt the appalling defeat i then sustained returned to torment me i felt assured that if i failed in this attempt my case would be a hopeless one—it would seal my fate as a slave forever i could not hope to get off with any thing less than the severest punishment and being placed beyond the means of escape it required no very vivid imagination to depict the most frightful scenes through which i should have to pass in case i failed the wretchedness of slavery and the blessedness of freedom were perpetually before me it was life and death with me but i remained firm and according to my resolution on the third day of september  i left my chains and succeeded in reaching new york without the slightest interruption of any kind how i did so—what means i adopted—what direction i travelled and by what mode of conveyance—i must leave unexplained for the reasons before mentioned,299,1718,-6.5,-0.6229230629453296,-1.4262734584450403,-0.5714176039831704,-6.5,-0.5723461748093573,-1.532544378698225,-0.56951113523467,-119.39508052526867,-0.10181859717391793,-1.1881112970864018,-0.6319557773521731,-1.816666666666665,-0.3396365999254237,-0.739988153783453,-0.4463209210946142,2.093,-0.3545604592276806,-0.2004151975483574,-0.4054252922395597,-76.43096160886661,-1.1953702182669987,-1.7642863520659104,-1.0283407919637064,-2.24120790686371,-0.24267014289665156,-0.6583163824515357,-0.3589918967388975,"{'neg': 0.223, 'neu': 0.603, 'pos': 0.174, 'compound': -0.9727}",-0.9727,-0.33748895726980627,-0.5908341575997362,-0.413456797219516,0.04043037209703876,-0.20703356194639694,-0.22016507872610697,-0.17761169854102604,-0.5191,-0.0826204051345355,0.21387835293475593,0.10061947774415184,0.27050384962998175,-0.18080271156528674,0.1441165112557875,-0.1271988262477179,52.754586115407335,-0.15147540491745923,0.6450405206277641,-0.3441870683572681
134,134,1471,1478,1485,"I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free
State. I have never been able to answer the question with any
satisfaction to myself. It was a moment of the highest excitement I
ever experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed
mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the
pursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my
arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of
hungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I
was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I
was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of
slavery. This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm.
But the loneliness overcame me. There I was in the midst of thousands,
and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the
midst of thousands of my own brethren—children of a common Father, and
yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition. I was
afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and
thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose
business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the
ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto
which I adopted when I started from slavery was this—“Trust no man!” I
saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause
for distrust. It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it,
one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar
circumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land—a land
given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders—whose inhabitants
are legalized kidnappers—where he is every moment subjected to the
terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the
hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!—I say, let him place himself in
my situation—without home or friends—without money or credit—wanting
shelter, and no one to give it—wanting bread, and no money to buy
it,—and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless
men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or
where to stay,—perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and
means of escape,—in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible
gnawings of hunger,—in the midst of houses, yet having no home,—among
fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose
greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is
only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up
the helpless fish upon which they subsist,—I say, let him be placed in
this most trying situation,—the situation in which I was placed,—then,
and not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know
how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.",i have been frequently asked how i felt when i found myself in a free state i have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself it was a moment of the highest excitement i ever experienced i suppose i felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man of war from the pursuit of a pirate in writing to a dear friend immediately after my arrival at new york i said i felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions this state of mind however very soon subsided and i was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness i was yet liable to be taken back and subjected to all the tortures of slavery this in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm but the loneliness overcame me there i was in the midst of thousands and yet a perfect stranger without home and without friends in the midst of thousands of my own brethren—children of a common father and yet i dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition i was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one and thereby falling into the hands of money loving kidnappers whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey the motto which i adopted when i started from slavery was this—“trust no man” i saw in every white man an enemy and in almost every colored man because for distrust it was a most painful situation and to understand it one must needs experience it or imagine himself in similar circumstances let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land—a land given up to be the hunting ground for slaveholders—whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers—where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey—i say let him place himself in my situation—without home or friends—without money or credit—wanting shelter and no one to give it—wanting bread and no money to buy it—and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men hunters and in total darkness as to what to do where to go or where to stay—perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape—in the midst of plenty yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger—in the midst of houses yet having no home—among fellow men yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist—i say let him be placed in this most trying situation—the situation in which i was placed—then and not till then will he fully appreciate the hardships of and know how to sympathize with the toil worn and whip scarred fugitive slave,523,2884,-16.35,-0.875878197511302,-3.53887399463807,-0.8078436590215924,-17.35,-0.879933381110349,-4.100591715976332,-0.8718918612014976,-385.6971664082919,-0.23192045913546186,-3.838107555586611,-1.1671218601622502,-12.089333333333332,-1.2147305107576307,-4.491234995245212,-1.3262755824370103,-3.044999999999996,-0.6218813900068474,-0.8776485319800961,-0.6986496092853736,-135.3048357894199,-1.2065446897233243,-3.0037752743136528,-1.0385654279152254,-5.03177766977549,-0.3161976450136723,-1.5897503570865144,-0.4849063131804594,"{'neg': 0.174, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': -0.9967}",-0.9967,-0.25154444446015783,-0.6052213529958337,-0.2583874191161975,0.03014233241505967,-0.2135028381448179,-0.2750734589897364,-0.2334251894628219,-1.0,-0.084531831991527,-0.04857150653532347,0.0851582245420333,0.1586544453402877,-0.24450793559013195,-0.10662575955544076,-0.33074077474691027,81.29465797731027,-0.17967561336848514,1.5047438571507674,-0.6765571877293224

wanted to go; as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York. I
told him I was a calker, and should like to go where I could get work.
I thought of going to Canada; but he decided against it, and in favor
of my going to New Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there
at my trade. At this time, Anna,[2] my intended wife, came on; for I
wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York, (notwithstanding
my homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,) informing her of my
successful flight, and wishing her to come on forthwith. In a few days
after her arrival, Mr. Ruggles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington,

143,143,1512,1517,1523,"We now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for
the duties and responsibilities of a life of freedom. On the morning
after our arrival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the
question arose as to what name I should be called by. The name given me
by my mother was, “Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.” I, however,
had dispensed with the two middle names long before I left Maryland so
that I was generally known by the name of “Frederick Bailey.” I started
from Baltimore bearing the name of “Stanley.” When I got to New York, I
again changed my name to “Frederick Johnson,” and thought that would be
the last change. But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary
again to change my name. The reason of this necessity was, that there
were so many Johnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to
distinguish between them. I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing
me a name, but told him he must not take from me the name of
“Frederick.” I must hold on to that, to preserve a sense of my
identity. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and
at once suggested that my name be “Douglass.” From that time until now

144,144,1524,1528,1532,"I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New
Bedford. The impression which I had received respecting the character
and condition of the people of the north, I found to be singularly
erroneous. I had very strangely supposed, while in slavery, that few of
the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at
the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholders of the
south. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northern
people owned no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a level
with the non-slaveholding population of the south. I knew _they_ were
exceedingly poor, and I had been accustomed to regard their poverty as
the necessary consequence of their being non-slaveholders. I had
somehow imbibed the opinion that, in the absence of slaves, there could
be no wealth, and very little refinement. And upon coming to the north,
I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and uncultivated
population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowing nothing
of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Such
being my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New
Bedford may very readily infer how palpably I must have seen my

145,145,1533,1538,1543,"In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the
wharves, to take a view of the shipping. Here I found myself surrounded
with the strongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and riding
in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest model, in the best order,
and of the largest size. Upon the right and left, I was walled in by
granite warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their utmost
capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life. Added to this,
almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared
with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud
songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard
no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of
men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand
his work, and went at it with a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which
betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, as well
as a sense of his own dignity as a man. To me this looked exceedingly
strange. From the wharves I strolled around and over the town, gazing
with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautiful
dwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth,
comfort, taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of
slaveholding Maryland.",in the afternoon of the day when i reached new bedford i visited the wharves to take a view of the shipping here i found myself surrounded with the strongest proofs of wealth lying at the wharves and riding in the stream i saw many ships of the finest model in the best order and of the largest size upon the right and left i was walled in by granite warehouses of the widest dimensions stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts of life added to this almost every body seemed to be at work but noiselessly so compared with what i had been accustomed to in baltimore there were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships i heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the laborer i saw no whipping of men but all seemed to go smoothly on every man appeared to understand his work and went at it with a sober yet cheerful earnestness which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man to me this looked exceedingly strange from the wharves i strolled around and over the town gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches beautiful dwellings and finely cultivated gardens evincing an amount of wealth comfort taste and refinement such as i had never seen in any part of slaveholding maryland,243,1348,16.6,1.7691296807753736,3.5281501340482584,1.6643290418087604,15.6,1.7392697344812276,3.6982248520710064,1.7029764146010526,215.61477774646292,0.39319381226171685,2.1456022487051283,1.4042476105620676,5.572266666666667,1.1500623506587826,1.9582121994294257,1.0516526327572504,12.151000000000002,0.5420031789085016,1.1253171647938838,0.5780153224340759,90.36303154931127,1.0759540121342999,1.7472764539251309,1.0499197749440257,4.112238035107812,0.602113920300474,1.462331337956698,1.0876843709698383,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.758, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.988}",0.988,0.12934382259161267,0.5845397596139436,0.4288479234051461,0.31894576012223075,-0.1088655253229748,1.2663016639855331,0.6693301621619115,0.9996,-0.01906352621624831,1.042704723442574,0.6147218061161114,1.0125414697705934,0.16478431295070411,1.8076050124507859,0.9769721020044072,46.30737613447493,-0.13250044046507467,0.4508333035369506,-0.12054648034274563
146,146,1544,1552,1561,"Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I saw few or no
dilapidated houses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked
children and barefooted women, such as I had been accustomed to see in
Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael’s, and Baltimore. The people looked
more able, stronger, healthier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I
was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without being
saddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the most astonishing as well as
the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored
people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as a
refuge from the hunters of men. I found many, who had not been seven
years out of their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently
enjoying more of the comforts of life, than the average of slaveholders
in Maryland. I will venture to assert, that my friend Mr. Nathan
Johnson (of whom I can say with a grateful heart, “I was hungry, and he
gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink; I was a stranger,
and he took me in”) lived in a neater house; dined at a better table;
took, paid for, and read, more newspapers; better understood the moral,
religious, and political character of the nation,—than nine tenths of
the slaveholders in Talbot county Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a
working man. His hands were hardened by toil, and not his alone, but
those also of Mrs. Johnson. I found the colored people much more
spirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a
determination to protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper,
at all hazards. Soon after my arrival, I was told of a circumstance
which illustrated their spirit. A colored man and a fugitive slave were
on unfriendly terms. The former was heard to threaten the latter with
informing his master of his whereabouts. Straightway a meeting was
called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice,
“Business of importance!” The betrayer was invited to attend. The
people came at the appointed hour, and organized the meeting by
appointing a very religious old gentleman as president, who, I believe,
made a prayer, after which he addressed the meeting as follows:
“_Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommend that you young
men just take him outside the door, and kill him!_” With this, a number
of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid
than themselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not
been seen in New Bedford since. I believe there have been no more such
threats, and should there be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be
the consequence.",every thing looked clean new and beautiful i saw few or no dilapidated houses with poverty stricken inmates no half naked children and barefooted women such as i had been accustomed to see in hillsborough easton st michael’s and baltimore the people looked more able stronger healthier and happier than those of maryland i was for once made glad by a view of extreme wealth without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty but the most astonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of the colored people a great many of whom like myself had escaped thither as a refuge from the hunters of men i found many who had not been seven years out of their chains living in finer houses and evidently enjoying more of the comforts of life than the average of slaveholders in maryland i will venture to assert that my friend mr nathan johnson of whom i can say with a grateful heart “i was hungry and he gave me meat i was thirsty and he gave me drink i was a stranger and he took me in” lived in a neater house dined at a better table took paid for and read more newspapers better understood the moral religious and political character of the nation—than nine tenths of the slaveholders in talbot county maryland yet mr johnson was a working man his hands were hardened by toil and not his alone but those also of mrs johnson i found the colored people much more spirited than i had supposed they would be i found among them a determination to protect each other from the blood thirsty kidnapper at all hazards soon after my arrival i was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit a colored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms the former was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts straightway a meeting was called among the colored people under the stereotyped notice “business of importance” the betrayer was invited to attend the people came at the appointed hour and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious old gentleman as president who i believe made a prayer after which he addressed the meeting as follows “friends we have got him here and i would recommend that you young men just take him outside the door and kill him” with this a number of them bolted at him but they were intercepted by some more timid than themselves and the betrayer escaped their vengeance and has not been seen in new bedford since i believe there have been no more such threats and should there be hereafter i doubt not that death would be the consequence,457,2616,6.35,0.3236272337791041,1.3297587131367294,0.31328138793090715,5.349999999999999,0.3273176622864335,1.2721893491124259,0.31492423338374825,0.0,0.05181337979882846,0.0,0.0,3.3389333333333333,0.34761820043074254,1.1426708327672872,0.24475126854984483,12.908000000000001,0.08836373666762135,1.2250963851451537,0.08041823847804269,31.008360777015675,-0.024485330866226878,0.49766518016555417,0.04301831093429302,1.9278088934698643,0.16259142983563488,0.7332144584054479,0.3350106596863543,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.9911}",0.9911,0.008337931638477916,0.5863981056859395,0.21051742569786222,0.23804112554112555,-0.1748761654538972,0.834504880731413,0.09982529783281911,-0.8179,-0.08320271518693605,0.05080907031953506,0.09590925661830954,1.8171642385447302,0.14459791405825123,3.6113959353447282,0.912475366820659,75.5058483275697,-0.16653879621304285,1.33036941988729,-0.521725513569681

with a load of oil. It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went
at it with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master. It
was a happy moment, the rapture of which can be understood only by
those who have been slaves. It was the first work, the reward of which
was to be entirely my own. There was no Master Hugh standing ready, the
moment I earned the money, to rob me of it. I worked that day with a
pleasure I had never before experienced. I was at work for myself and
newly-married wife. It was to me the starting-point of a new existence.
When I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of
calking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among
the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I
could get no employment.[4] Finding my trade of no immediate benefit, I
threw off my calking habiliments, and prepared myself to do any kind of
work I could get to do. Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse

man to me, and inquired if I did not wish to take the “Liberator.” I
told him I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery, I
remarked that I was unable to pay for it then. I, however, finally
became a subscriber to it. The paper came, and I read it from week to
week with such feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt to
describe. The paper became my meat and my drink. My soul was set all on
fire. Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds—its scathing denunciations
of slaveholders—its faithful exposures of slavery—and its powerful
attacks upon the upholders of the institution—sent a thrill of joy

150,150,1584,1588,1592,"I had not long been a reader of the “Liberator,” before I got a pretty
correct idea of the principles, measures and spirit of the anti-slavery
reform. I took right hold of the cause. I could do but little; but what
I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt happier than when in
an anti-slavery meeting. I seldom had much to say at the meetings,
because what I wanted to say was said so much better by others. But,
while attending an anti-slavery convention at Nantucket, on the 11th of
August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time
much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman who had heard
me speak in the colored people’s meeting at New Bedford. It was a
severe cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was, I felt
myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me
down. I spoke but a few moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and
said what I desired with considerable ease. From that time until now, I
have been engaged in pleading the cause of my brethren—with what
success, and with what devotion, I leave those acquainted with my

152,152,1594,1606,1619,"I find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative, that I have, in
several instances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting
religion, as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious
views to suppose me an opponent of all religion. To remove the
liability of such misapprehension, I deem it proper to append the
following brief explanation. What I have said respecting and against
religion, I mean strictly to apply to the _slaveholding religion_ of
this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper; for,
between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ,
I recognize the widest possible difference—so wide, that to receive the
one as good, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as
bad, corrupt, and wicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity
to be the enemy of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial
Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding,
women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical
Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most
deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I
look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds,
and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of
“stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.” I
am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious
pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every
where surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers
for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who
wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on
Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. The
man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a
class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way of life, and the
path of salvation. He who sells my sister, for purposes of
prostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity. He who
proclaims it a religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of
learning to read the name of the God who made me. He who is the
religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred
influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution. The
warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that
scatters whole families,—sundering husbands and wives, parents and
children, sisters and brothers,—leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth
desolate. We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer
against adultery. We have men sold to build churches, women sold to
support the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for the _Poor
Heathen! All For The Glory Of God And The Good Of Souls!_ The slave
auctioneer’s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other,
and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the
religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals
in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the
church stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling
of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the
church, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies and
souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they
mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to
support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal
business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and
robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and
hell presenting the semblance of paradise.",i find since reading over the foregoing narrative that i have in several instances spoken in such a tone and manner respecting religion as may possibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me an opponent of all religion to remove the liability of such misapprehension i deem it proper to append the following brief explanation what i have said respecting and against religion i mean strictly to apply to the slaveholding religion of this land and with no possible reference to christianity proper for between the christianity of this land and the christianity of christ i recognize the widest possible difference—so wide that to receive the one as good pure and holy is of necessity to reject the other as bad corrupt and wicked to be the friend of the one is of necessity to be the enemy of the other i love the pure peaceable and impartial christianity of christ i therefore hate the corrupt slaveholding women whipping cradle plundering partial and hypocritical christianity of this land indeed i can see no reason but the most deceitful one for calling the religion of this land christianity i look upon it as the climax of all misnomers the boldest of all frauds and the grossest of all libels never was there a clearer case of “stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in” i am filled with unutterable loathing when i contemplate the religious pomp and show together with the horrible inconsistencies which every where surround me we have men stealers for ministers women whippers for missionaries and cradle plunderers for church members the man who wields the blood clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on sunday and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly jesus the man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me as a class leader on sunday morning to show me the way of life and the path of salvation he who sells my sister for purposes of prostitution stands forth as the pious advocate of purity he who proclaims it a religious duty to read the bible denies me the right of learning to read the name of the god who made me he who is the religious advocate of marriage robs whole millions of its sacred influence and leaves them to the ravages of wholesale pollution the warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same that scatters whole families—sundering husbands and wives parents and children sisters and brothers—leaving the hut vacant and the hearth desolate we see the thief preaching against theft and the adulterer against adultery we have men sold to build churches women sold to support the gospel and babes sold to purchase bibles for the poor heathen all for the glory of god and the good of souls the slave auctioneer’s bell and the church going bell chime in with each other and the bitter cries of the heart broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master revivals of religion and revivals in the slave trade go hand in hand together the slave prison and the church stand near each other the clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church may be heard at the same time the dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit and they mutually help each other the dealer gives his blood stained gold to support the pulpit and the pulpit in return covers his infernal business with the garb of christianity here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes and hell presenting the semblance of paradise,638,3676,-5.799999999999999,-0.2869477340221826,-1.2761394101876673,-0.2573962193458123,-6.799999999999998,-0.27428238146210987,-1.6035502958579877,-0.27649262090618043,-120.67031097393227,-0.020955573471476488,-1.2008012311756473,-0.2993306558776977,-0.8991071428571432,-0.09997836217219461,-0.4049249830186119,-0.20533149032654374,29.952000000000012,0.4782613784849553,3.4716446436221045,0.508096944393169,97.21516063496756,0.28146373001245445,1.8915363351321315,0.32296155294086276,-5.94662829440231,-0.3058099618304554,-1.8951084114948429,-0.4671176078860386,"{'neg': 0.144, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.9944}",-0.9944,-0.22940420573027978,-0.6038425801037076,-0.2184398652973134,-0.02202380952380953,-0.22118687791350375,-0.5534897994207726,-0.2997190175075953,-0.9999,-0.08078553798487277,-0.048516931808879296,0.11546145063441307,-0.17364804320862912,-0.30547884286520577,-0.8515763572284496,-0.5255464199431679,97.1282621419044,-0.18397389317043555,1.9816943846529953,-0.7272170888201162

compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye
make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.—Woe unto you,

and cumin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment,
mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the
other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a

clean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are
full of extortion and excess.—Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,

the overwhelming mass of professed Christians in America. They strain
at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of our
churches? They would be shocked at the proposition of fellowshipping a
_sheep_-stealer; and at the same time they hug to their communion a
_man_-stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I find fault with
them for it. They attend with Pharisaical strictness to the outward
forms of religion, and at the same time neglect the weightier matters
of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are always ready to
sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy. They are they who are represented
as professing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate
their brother whom they have seen. They love the heathen on the other
