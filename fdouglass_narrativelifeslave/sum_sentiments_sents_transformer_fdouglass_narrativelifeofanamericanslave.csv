You are freedomâs swift-winged angels, that fly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear, Iâll try it. I had as well die with ague as the fever. I have only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water. This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steamboats steered in a north-east course from North Point. I will do the same; and when I get to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delaware into Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke. I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free. There is a better day coming.â",-0.6445921063423157,3.4807174503803253,4.5688289403915405,-0.9631023406982422,-1.6272732615470886,0.973414182662964,-1,1.4415465295314789,âyou are loosed from your moorings and are free i am fast in my chains and am a slave you move merrily before the gentle gale and i sadly before the bloody whip you are freedomâs swift winged angels that fly round the world i am confined in bands of iron o that i were free o that i were on one of your gallant decks and under your protecting wing alas betwixt me and you the turbid waters roll go on go on o that i could also go could i but swim if i could fly o why was i born a man of whom to make a brute the glad ship is gone she hides in the dim distance i am left in the hottest hell of unending slavery o god save me god deliver me let me be free is there any god why am i a slave i will run away i will not stand it get caught or get clear iâll try it i had as well die with ague as the fever i have only one life to lose i had as well be killed running as die standing only think of it one hundred miles straight north and i am free try it yes god helping me i will it cannot be that i shall live and die a slave i will take to the water this very bay shall yet bear me into freedom the steamboats steered in a north east course from north point i will do the same and when i get to the head of the bay i will turn my canoe adrift and walk straight through delaware into pennsylvania when i get there i shall not be required to have a pass i can travel without being disturbed let but the first opportunity offer and come what will i am off meanwhile i will try to bear up under the yoke i am not the only slave in the world why should i fret i can bear as much as any of them besides i am but a boy and all boys are bound to some one it may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when i get free there is a better day comingâ,1840,383,0.7358184639643383,-0.5900395982088181,0.14873803471435393,0.13702989514637973,0.782977647873683,-0.45229039250044706,-1.2267998727552167,-0.41130752843283325,-0.009188298814149965,-0.8621684156562154,-0.05285906223669529,0.21175067246168372,0.0,0.13872505010829403,0.7964191398768973,0.15657091805339657,2.311473700116916,-0.9364613784427722,-0.03872573052544192,-0.12471501783752374,2.098013531461538,0.8566892019010325,0.4796618490693081,0.8302784500654345,0.4907812206860048,-1.4648638435692178,-0.09020204752324576,0.3887042667352368,-0.08433734939759036,-0.060822136067684364,-0.21933195156505308,0.8559743902007089,0.04309799162315181,0.855974390200709
