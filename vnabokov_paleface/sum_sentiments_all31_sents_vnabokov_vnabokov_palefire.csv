2855,2855,He stood at the top of a green ladder attending to the sick branch of a grateful tree in one of the most famous avenues in Appalachia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2856,2856,His red flannel shirt lay on the grass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2857,2857,"We conversed, a little shyly, he above, I below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2858,2858,I was pleasantly surprised at his being able to refer all his patients to their proper habitats.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2859,2859,"It was spring, and we were alone in that admirable colonnade of trees which visitors from England have photographed from end to end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2860,2860,"I can enumerate here only a few kinds of those trees: Jove s stout oak and two others: the thunder-cloven from Britain, the knotty-entrailed from a Mediterranean island; a weather-fending line (now lime), a phoenix (now date palm), a pine and a cedar (Cedrus), all insular; a Venetian sycamore tree (Acer); two willows, the green, likewise from Venice, the hoar-leaved from Denmark; a midsummer elm, its barky fingers enringed with ivy; a midsummer mulberry, its shade inviting to tarry; and a clown s sad cypress from Illyria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2861,2861,He had worked for two years as a male nurse in a hospital for Negroes in Maryland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2862,2862,He was hard up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2863,2863,"He wanted to study landscaping, botany and French ( to read in the original Baudelaire and Dumas ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2864,2864,I promised him some financial assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2865,2865,He started to work at my place the very next day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2866,2866,"He was awfully nice and pathetic, and all that, but a little too talkative and completely impotent which I found discouraging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2867,2867,"Otherwise he was a strong strapping fellow, and I hugely enjoyed the aesthetic pleasure of watching him buoyantly struggle with earth and turf or delicately manipulate bulbs, or lay out the flagged path which may or may not be a nice surprise for my landlord, when he safely returns from England (where I hope no bloodthirsty maniacs are stalking him!).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2868,2868,"How I longed to have him (my gardener, not my landlord) wear a great big turban, and shalwars, and an ankle bracelet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2869,2869,"I would certainly have him attired according to the old romanticist notion of a Moorish prince, had I been a northern king or rather had I still been a king (exile becomes a bad habit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2870,2870,"You will chide me, my modest man, for writing so much about you in this note, but I feel I must pay you this tribute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2871,2871,"After all, you saved my life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2872,2872,"You and I were the last people who saw John Shade alive, and you admitted afterwards to a strange premonition which made you interrupt your work as you noticed us from the shrubbery walking toward the porch where stood (Superstitiously I cannot write out the odd dark word you employed.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2873,2873,Line : [= Line : I was the shadow of the waxwing slain],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2874,2874,Through the back of John s thin cotton shirt one could distinguish patches of pink where it stuck to the skin above and around the outline of the funny little garment he wore under the shirt as all good Americans do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2875,2875,"I see with such awful clarity one fat shoulder rolling, the other rising; his gray mop of hair, his creased nape; the red bandanna handkerchief limply hanging out of one hip pocket, the wallet bulge of the other; the broad deformed pelvis; the grass stains on the seat of his old khaki pants, the scuffed back seams of his loafers; and I hear his delightful growl as he looks back at me, without stopping, to say something like: Be sure not to spill anything this is not a paper chase, or [wincing] I have to write again to Bob Wells [the town mayor] about those damned Tuesday night trucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2876,2876,"We had reached the Goldsworth side of the lane, and the flagged walk that scrambled along a side lawn to connect with the gravel path leading up from Dulwich road to the Goldsworth front door, when Shade remarked: You have a caller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2877,2877,"In profile to us on the porch a short thickset, dark-haired man in a brown suit stood holding by its ridiculous strap a shabby and shapeless briefcase, his curved forefinger still directed toward the bell button he had just pressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2878,2878,"I will kill him, I muttered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2879,2879,"Recently a bonneted girl had made me accept a bunch of religious tracts and had told me that her brother, whom for some reason I had pictured to myself as a fragile neurotic youth, would drop in to discuss with me God s Purpose, and explain anything I had not understood in the tracts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2880,2880,"Youth, indeed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2881,2881,"Oh, I will kill him, I repeated under my breath so intolerable was it to think that the rapture of the poem might be delayed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2882,2882,"In my fury and hurry to dismiss the intruder, I outstripped John who until then had been in front of me, heading at a good shamble for the double treat of revel and revelation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2883,2883,Had I ever seen Gradus before?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2884,2884,Let me think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2885,2885,Had I?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2886,2886,Memory shakes her head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2887,2887,"Nevertheless the killer affirmed to me later that once from my tower, overlooking the Palace orchard, I had waved to him as he and one of my former pages, a boy with hair like excelsior, were carrying cradled glass from the hothouse to a horse-drawn van; but, as the caller now veered toward us and transfixed us with his snake-sad, close-set eyes, I felt such a tremor of recognition that had I been in bed dreaming I would have awoken with a groan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2888,2888,"His first bullet ripped a sleeve button off my black blazer, another sang past my ear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2889,2889,"It is evil piffle to assert that he aimed not at me (whom he had just seen in the library let us be consistent, gentlemen, ours is a rational world after all), but at the gray-locked gentleman behind me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2890,2890,"Oh, he was aiming at me all right but missing me every time, the incorrigible bungler, as I instinctively backed, bellowing and spreading my great strong arms (with my left hand still holding the poem, still clutching the inviolable shade, to quote Matthew Arnold, - ), in an effort to halt the advancing madman and shield John, whom I feared he might, quite accidentally, hit, while he, my sweet awkward old John, kept clawing at me and pulling me after him, back to the protection of his laurels, with the solemn fussiness of a poor lame boy trying to get his spastic brother out of the range of the stones hurled at them by schoolchildren, once a familiar sight in all countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2891,2891,"I felt I still feel John s hand fumbling at mine, seeking my fingertips, finding them, only to abandon them at once as if passing to me, in a sublime relay race, the baton of life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2892,2892,One of the bullets that spared me struck him in the side and went through his heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2893,2893,"His presence behind me abruptly failing me caused me to lose my balance, and, simultaneously, to complete the farce of fate, my gardener s spade dealt gunman Jack from behind the hedge a tremendous blow on the pate, felling him and sending his weapon flying from his grasp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2894,2894,Our savior retrieved it and helped me to my feet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2895,2895,My coccyx and right wrist hurt badly but the poem was safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2896,2896,"John, though, lay prone on the ground, with a red spot on his white shirt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2897,2897,I still hoped he had not been killed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2898,2898,"The madman sat on the porch step, dazedly nursing with bloody hands a bleeding head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2899,2899,"Leaving the gardener to watch over him I hurried into the house and concealed the invaluable envelope under a heap of girls galoshes, furred snowboots and white Wellingtons heaped at the bottom of a closet, from which I exited as if it had been the end of the secret passage that had taken me all the way out of my enchanted castle and right from Zembla to this Arcady.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2900,2900,I then dialed and returned with a glass of water to the scene of the carnage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2901,2901,The poor poet had now been turned over and lay with open dead eyes directed up at the sunny evening azure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2902,2902,The armed gardener and the battered killer were smoking side by side on the steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2903,2903,"The latter, either because he was in pain, or because he had decided to play a new role, ignored me as completely as if I were a stone king on a stone charger in the Tessera Square of Onhava; but the poem was safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2904,2904,"The gardener took the glass of water I had placed near a flowerpot beside the porch steps and shared it with the killer, and then accompanied him to the basement toilet, and presently the police and the ambulance arrived, and the gunman gave his name as Jack Grey, no fixed abode, except the Institute for the Criminal Insane, ici, good dog, which of course should have been his permanent address all along, and which the police thought he had just escaped from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2905,2905,"Come along, Jack, we put something on that head of yours, said a calm but purposeful cop stepping over the body, and then there was the awful moment when Dr. Sutton s daughter drove up with Sybil Shade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2906,2906,"In the course of that chaotic night I found a moment to transfer the poem from under the booties of Goldsworth s four nymphets to the austere security of my black valise, but only at daybreak did I find it safe enough to examine my treasure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2907,2907,"We know how firmly, how stupidly I believed that Shade was composing a poem, a kind of romaunt, about the King of Zembla.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2908,2908,We have been prepared for the horrible disappointment in store for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2909,2909,"Oh, I did not expect him to devote himself completely to that theme!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2910,2910,"It might have been blended of course with some of his own life stuff and sundry Americana but I was sure his poem would contain the wonderful incidents I had described to him, the characters I had made alive for him and all the unique atmosphere of my kingdom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2911,2911,"I even suggested to him a good title the title of the book in me whose pages he was to cut: Solus Rex; instead of which I saw Pale Fire, which meant to me nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2912,2912,I started to read the poem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2913,2913,I read faster and faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2914,2914,"I sped through it, snarling, as a furious young heir through an old deceiver s testament.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2915,2915,Where were the battlements of my sunset castle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2916,2916,Where was Zembla the Fair?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2917,2917,Where her spine of mountains?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2918,2918,Where her long thrill through the mist?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2919,2919,"And my lovely flower boys, and the spectrum of the stained windows, and the Black Rose Paladins, and the whole marvelous tale?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2920,2920,Nothing of it was there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2921,2921,The complex contribution I had been pressing upon him with a hypnotist s patience and a lover s urge was simply not there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2922,2922,"Oh, but I cannot express the agony!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2923,2923,Instead of the wild glorious romance what did I have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2924,2924,"An autobiographical, eminently Appalachian, rather old-fashioned narrative in a neo-Popian prosodic style beautifully written of course Shade could not write otherwise than beautifully but void of my magic, of that special rich streak of magical madness which I was sure would run through it and make it transcend its time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2925,2925,Gradually I regained my usual composure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2926,2926,I reread Pale Fire more carefully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2927,2927,I liked it better when expecting less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2928,2928,And what was that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2929,2929,"What was that dim distant music, those vestiges of color in the air?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2930,2930,"Here and there I discovered in it and especially, especially in the invaluable variants, echoes and spangles of my mind, a long ripplewake of my glory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2931,2931,"I now felt a new, pitiful tenderness toward the poem as one has for a fickle young creature who has been stolen and brutally enjoyed by a black giant but now again is safe in our hall and park, whistling with the stableboys, swimming with the tame seal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2932,2932,"The spot still hurts, it must hurt, but with strange gratitude we kiss those heavy wet eyelids and caress that polluted flesh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2933,2933,"My commentary to this poem, now in the hands of my readers, represents an attempt to sort out those echoes and wavelets of fire, and pale phosphorescent hints, and all the many subliminal debts to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2934,2934,Some of my notes may sound bitter but I have done my best not to air any grievances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2935,2935,And in this final scholium my intention is not to complain of the vulgar and cruel nonsense that professional reporters and Shade s friends in the obituaries they concocted allowed themselves to spout when misdescribing the circumstances of Shade s death.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2936,2936,I regard their references to me as a mixture of journalistic callousness and the venom of vipers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2937,2937,I do not doubt that many of the statements made in this work will be brushed aside by the guilty parties when it is out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2938,2938,Mrs. Shade will not remember having been shown by her husband who showed her everything one or two of the precious variants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2939,2939,The three students lying on the grass will turn out to be totally amnesic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2940,2940,The desk girl at the Library will not recall (will have been told not to recall) anybody asking for Dr. Kinbote on the day of the murder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2941,2941,And I am sure that Mr. Emerald will interrupt briefly his investigation of some mammate student s resilient charms to deny with the vigor of roused virility that he ever gave anybody a lift to my house that evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2942,2942,"In other words, everything will be done to cut off my person completely from my dear friend s fate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2943,2943,"Nevertheless, I have had my little revenge: public misapprehension indirectly helped me to obtain the right of publishing Pale Fire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2944,2944,"My good gardener, when enthusiastically relating to everybody what he had seen, certainly erred in several respects not so much perhaps in his exaggerated account of my heroism as in the assumption that Shade had been deliberately aimed at by the so-called Jack Grey; but Shade s widow found herself so deeply affected by the idea of my having thrown myself between the gunman and his target that during a scene I shall never forget, she cried out, stroking my hands: There are things for which no recompense in this world or another is great enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2945,2945,"That other world comes in handy when misfortune befalls the infidel but I let it pass of course, and, indeed, resolved not to refute anything, saying instead: Oh, but there is a recompense, my dear Sybil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2946,2946,"It may seem to you a very modest request but give me the permission, Sybil, to edit and publish John s last poem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2947,2947,"The permission was given at once, with new cries and new hugs, and already next day her signature was under the agreement I had a quick little lawyer draw up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2948,2948,"That moment of grateful grief you soon forgot, dear girl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2949,2949,"But I assure you that I do not mean any harm, and that John Shade, perhaps, will not be too much annoyed by my notes, despite the intrigues and the dirt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2950,2950,"Because of these machinations I was confronted with nightmare problems in my endeavors to make people calmly see without having them immediately scream and hustle me the truth of the tragedy a tragedy in which I had been not a chance witness but the protagonist, and the main, if only potential, victim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2951,2951,"The hullabaloo ended by affecting the course of my new life, and necessitated my removal to this modest mountain cabin; but I did manage to obtain, soon after his detention, an interview, perhaps even two interviews, with the prisoner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2952,2952,"He was now much more lucid than when he cowered bleeding on my porch step, and he told me all I wanted to know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2953,2953,"By making him believe I could help him at his trial I forced him to confess his heinous crime his deceiving the police and the nation by posing as Jack Grey, escapee from an asylum, who mistook Shade for the man who sent him there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2954,2954,"A few days later, alas, he thwarted justice by slitting his throat with a safety razor blade salvaged from an unwatched garbage container.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2955,2955,"He died, not so much because having played his part in the story he saw no point in existing any longer, but because he could not live down this last crowning botch killing the wrong person when the right one stood before him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2956,2956,"In other words, his life ended not in a feeble splutter of the clockwork but in a gesture of humanoid despair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2957,2957,Enough of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2958,2958,Exit Jack Grey.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2959,2959,"I cannot recall without a shudder the lugubrious week that I spent in New Wye before leaving it, I hope, forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2960,2960,I lived in constant fear that robbers would deprive me of my tender treasure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2961,2961,"Some of my readers may laugh when they learn that I fussily removed it from my black valise to an empty steel box in my landlord s study, and a few hours later took the manuscript out again, and for several days wore it, as it were, having distributed the ninety-two index cards about my person, twenty in the right-hand pocket of my coat, as many in the left-hand one, a batch of forty against my right nipple and the twelve precious ones with variants in my innermost left-breast pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2962,2962,"I blessed my royal stars for having taught myself wife work, for I now sewed up all four pockets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2963,2963,"Thus with cautious steps, among deceived enemies, I circulated, plated with poetry, armored with rhymes, stout with another man s song, stiff with cardboard, bullet-proof at long last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2964,2964,"Many years ago how many I would not care to say I remember my Zemblan nurse telling me, a little man of six in the throes of adult insomnia: Minnamin, Gut mag alkan, Pern dirstan (my darling, God makes hungry, the Devil thirsty).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2965,2965,"Well, folks, I guess many in this fine hall are as hungry and thirsty as me, and I d better stop, folks, right here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2966,2966,"Yes, better stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2967,2967,My notes and self are petering out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2968,2968,"Gentlemen, I have suffered very much, and more than any of you can imagine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2969,2969,I pray for the Lord s benediction to rest on my wretched countrymen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2970,2970,My work is finished.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2971,2971,My poet is dead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2972,2972,"And you, what will you be doing with yourself, poor King, poor Kinbote?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2973,2973,a gentle young voice may inquire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2974,2974,"God will help me, I trust, to rid myself of any desire to follow the example of two other characters in this work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2975,2975,I shall continue to exist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2976,2976,"I may assume other disguises, other forms, but I shall try to exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2977,2977,"I may turn up yet, on another campus, as an old, happy, healthy, heterosexual Russian, a writer in exile, sans fame, sans future, sans audience, sans anything but his art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2978,2978,"I may join forces with Odon in a new motion picture: Escape from Zembla (ball in the palace, bomb in the palace square).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2979,2979,"I may pander to the simple tastes of theatrical critics and cook up a stage play, an old-fashioned melodrama with three principles: a lunatic who intends to kill an imaginary king, another lunatic who imagines himself to be that king, and a distinguished old poet who stumbles by chance into the line of fire, and perishes in the clash between the two figments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2980,2980,"Oh, I may do many things!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2981,2981,"History permitting, I may sail back to my recovered kingdom, and with a great sob greet the gray coastline and the gleam of a roof in the rain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2982,2982,I may huddle and groan in a madhouse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2983,2983,"But whatever happens, wherever the scene is laid, somebody, somewhere, will quietly set out somebody has already set out, somebody still rather far away is buying a ticket, is boarding a bus, a ship, a plane, has landed, is walking toward a million photographers, and presently he will ring at my door a bigger, more respectable, more competent Gradus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
