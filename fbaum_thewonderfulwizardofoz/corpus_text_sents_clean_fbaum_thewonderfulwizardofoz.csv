0,the cyclone
1,dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt them who was the farmers wife
2,their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles
3,there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds
4,uncle henry and aunt them had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner
5,there was no garret at all and no cellarexcept a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path
6,it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole
7,when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side
8,not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions
9,the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it
10,even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere
11,once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else
12,when aunt them came there to live she was a young pretty wife
13,the sun and wind had changed her too
14,they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also
15,she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now
16,when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt them had been so startled by the childs laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothys merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at
17,uncle henry never laughed
18,he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was
19,he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke
20,it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings
21,toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose
22,toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly
23,today however they were not playing
24,uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual
25,dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too
26,aunt them was washing the dishes
27,from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm
28,there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also
29,suddenly uncle henry stood up
30,there is a cyclone coming them he called to his wife
31,ill go look after the stock
32,then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept
33,aunt them dropped her work and came to the door
34,one glance told her of the danger close at hand
35,quick dorothy she screamed
36,run for the cellar
37,toto jumped out of dorothys arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him
38,aunt them badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole
39,dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt
40,when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor
41,then a strange thing happened
42,the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air
43,dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon
44,the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone
45,in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather
46,it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily
47,after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle
48,toto did not like it
49,he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen
50,once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him
51,but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall
52,she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen
53,hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf
54,at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring
55,at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her
56,in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep
57,the council with the munchkins
58,she was awakened by a shock so sudden and severe that if dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt
59,as it was the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened and toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally
60,dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving nor was it dark for the bright sunshine came in at the window flooding the little room
61,she sprang from her bed and with toto at her heels ran and opened the door
62,the little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw
63,the cyclone had set the house down very gentlyfor a cyclonein the midst of a country of marvelous beauty
64,there were lovely patches of greensward all about with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits
65,banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes
66,a little way off was a small brook rushing and sparkling along between green banks and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry gray prairies
67,while she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen
68,they were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to but neither were they very small
69,in fact they seemed about as tall as dorothy who was a well grown child for her age although they were so far as looks go many years older
70,three were men and one a woman and all were oddly dressed
71,they wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved
72,the hats of the men were blue the little womans hat was white and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders
73,over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds
74,the men were dressed in blue of the same shade as their hats and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops
75,the men dorothy thought were about as old as uncle henry for two of them had beards
76,but the little woman was doubtless much older
77,her face was covered with wrinkles her hair was nearly white and she walked rather stiffly
78,when these people drew near the house where dorothy was standing in the doorway they paused and whispered among themselves as if afraid to come farther
79,but the little old woman walked up to dorothy made a low bow and said in a sweet voice
80,you are welcome most noble sorceress to the land of the munchkins
81,we are so grateful to you for having killed the wicked witch of the east and for setting our people free from bondage
82,dorothy listened to this speech with wonder
83,what could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress and saying she had killed the wicked witch of the east
84,dorothy was an innocent harmless little girl who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home and she had never killed anything in all her life
85,but the little woman evidently expected her to answer so dorothy said with hesitation you are very kind but there must be some mistake
86,i have not killed anything
87,your house did anyway replied the little old woman with a laugh and that is the same thing
88,see she continued pointing to the corner of the house
89,there are her two feet still sticking out from under a block of wood
90,dorothy looked and gave a little cry of fright
91,there indeed just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on two feet were sticking out shod in silver shoes with pointed toes
92,oh dear
93,oh dear cried dorothy clasping her hands together in dismay
94,the house must have fallen on her
95,whatever shall we do
96,there is nothing to be done said the little woman calmly
97,but who was she
98,asked dorothy
99,she was the wicked witch of the east as i said answered the little woman
100,she has held all the munchkins in bondage for many years making them slave for her night and day
101,now they are all set free and are grateful to you for the favor
102,who are the munchkins
103,inquired dorothy
104,they are the people who live in this land of the east where the wicked witch ruled
105,are you a munchkin
106,asked dorothy
107,no but i am their friend although i live in the land of the north
108,when they saw the witch of the east was dead the munchkins sent a swift messenger to me and i came at once
109,i am the witch of the north
110,oh gracious cried dorothy
111,are you a real witch
112,yes indeed answered the little woman
113,but i am a good witch and the people love me i am not as powerful as the wicked witch was who ruled here or i should have set the people free myself
114,but i thought all witches were wicked said the girl who was half frightened at facing a real witch
115,oh no that is a great mistake
116,there were only four witches in all the land of oz and two of them those who live in the north and the south are good witches
117,i know this is true for i am one of them myself and cannot be mistaken
118,those who dwelt in the east and the west were indeed wicked witches but now that you have killed one of them there is but one wicked witch in all the land of ozthe one who lives in the west
119,but said dorothy after a moments thought aunt them has told me that the witches were all deadyears and years ago
120,who is aunt them
121,inquired the little old woman
122,she is my aunt who lives in kansas where i came from
123,the witch of the north seemed to think for a time with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground
124,then she looked up and said i do not know where kansas is for i have never heard that country mentioned before
125,but tell me is it a civilized country
126,oh yes replied dorothy
127,then that accounts for it
128,in the civilized countries i believe there are no witches left nor wizards nor sorceresses nor magicians
129,but you see the land of oz has never been civilized for we are cut off from all the rest of the world
130,therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us
131,who are the wizards
132,asked dorothy
133,oz himself is the great wizard answered the witch sinking her voice to a whisper
134,he is more powerful than all the rest of us together
135,he lives in the city of emeralds
136,dorothy was going to ask another question but just then the munchkins who had been standing silently by gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the wicked witch had been lying
137,what is it
138,asked the little old woman and looked and began to laugh
139,the feet of the dead witch had disappeared entirely and nothing was left but the silver shoes
140,she was so old explained the witch of the north that she dried up quickly in the sun
141,that is the end of her
142,but the silver shoes are yours and you shall have them to wear
143,she reached down and picked up the shoes and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to dorothy
144,the witch of the east was proud of those silver shoes said one of the munchkins and there is some charm connected with them but what it is we never knew
145,dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table
146,then she came out again to the munchkins and said
147,i am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle for i am sure they will worry about me
148,can you help me find my way
149,the munchkins and the witch first looked at one another and then at dorothy and then shook their heads
150,at the east not far from here said one there is a great desert and none could live to cross it
151,it is the same at the south said another for i have been there and seen it
152,the south is the country of the quadlings
153,i am told said the third man that it is the same at the west
154,and that country where the winkies live is ruled by the wicked witch of the west who would make you her slave if you passed her way
155,the north is my home said the old lady and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this land of oz
156,I am afraid my dear you will have to live with us
157,dorothy began to sob at this for she felt lonely among all these strange people
158,her tears seemed to grieve the kind hearted munchkins for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also
159,as for the little old woman she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose while she counted one two three in a solemn voice
160,at once the cap changed to a slate on which was written in big white chalk marks
161,let dorothy go to the city of emeralds
162,the little old woman took the slate from her nose and having read the words on it asked is your name dorothy my dear
163,yes answered the child looking up and drying her tears
164,then you must go to the city of emeralds
165,perhaps oz will help you
166,where is this city
167,asked dorothy
168,it is exactly in the center of the country and is ruled by oz the great wizard i told you of
169,is he a good man
170,inquired the girl anxiously
171,he is a good wizard
172,whether he is a man or not i cannot tell for i have never seen him
173,how can i get there
174,asked dorothy
175,you must walk
176,it is a long journey through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible
177,however i will use all the magic arts i know of to keep you from harm
178,will not you go with me
179,pleaded the girl who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend
180,no i cannot do that she replied but i will give you my kiss and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the witch of the north
181,she came close to dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead
182,where her lips touched the girl they left a round shining mark as dorothy found out soon after
183,the road to the city of emeralds is paved with yellow brick said the witch so you cannot miss it
184,when you get to oz do not be afraid of him but tell your story and ask him to help you
185,good bye my dear
186,the three munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey after which they walked away through the trees
187,the witch gave dorothy a friendly little nod whirled around on her left heel three times and straightway disappeared much to the surprise of little toto who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by
188,but dorothy knowing her to be a witch had expected her to disappear in just that way and was not surprised in the least
189,how dorothy saved the scarecrow
190,when dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry
191,so she went to the cupboard and cut herself some bread which she spread with butter
192,she gave some to toto and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear sparkling water
193,toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting there
194,dorothy went to get him and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast
195,then she went back to the house and having helped herself and toto to a good drink of the cool clear water she set about making ready for the journey to the city of emeralds
196,dorothy had only one other dress but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a peg beside her bed
197,it was gingham with checks of white and blue and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings it was still a pretty frock
198,the girl washed herself carefully dressed herself in the clean gingham and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head
199,she took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard laying a white cloth over the top
200,then she looked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were
201,they surely will never do for a long journey toto she said
202,and toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant
203,at that moment dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged to the witch of the east
204,i wonder if they will fit me she said to toto
205,they would be just the thing to take a long walk in for they could not wear out
206,she took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones which fitted her as well as if they had been made for her
207,finally she picked up her basket
208,come along toto she said
209,we will go to the emerald city and ask the great oz how to get back to kansas again
210,she closed the door locked it and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress
211,and so with toto trotting along soberly behind her she started on her journey
212,there were several roads nearby but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks
213,within a short time she was walking briskly toward the emerald city her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard yellow road bed
214,the sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly and dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land
215,she was surprised as she walked along to see how pretty the country was about her
216,there were neat fences at the sides of the road painted a dainty blue color and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance
217,evidently the munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops
218,once in a while she would pass a house and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage
219,the houses of the munchkins were odd looking dwellings for each was round with a big dome for a roof
220,all were painted blue for in this country of the east blue was the favorite color
221,toward evening when dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night she came to a house rather larger than the rest
222,on the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing
223,five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts pies and cakes and many other good things to eat
224,the people greeted dorothy kindly and invited her to supper and to pass the night with them for this was the home of one of the richest munchkins in the land and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the wicked witch
225,dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich munchkin himself whose name was boq
226,then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance
227,when boq saw her silver shoes he said you must be a great sorceress
228,why
229,asked the girl
230,because you wear silver shoes and have killed the wicked witch
231,besides you have white in your frock and only witches and sorceresses wear white
232,my dress is blue and white checked said dorothy smoothing out the wrinkles in it
233,it is kind of you to wear that said boq
234,blue is the color of the munchkins and white is the witch color
235,so we know you are a friendly witch
236,dorothy did not know what to say to this for all the people seemed to think her a witch and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land
237,when she had tired watching the dancing boq led her into the house where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it
238,the sheets were made of blue cloth and dorothy slept soundly in them till morning with toto curled up on the blue rug beside her
239,she ate a hearty breakfast and watched a wee munchkin baby who played with toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused dorothy
240,toto was a fine curiosity to all the people for they had never seen a dog before
241,how far is it to the emerald city
242,the girl asked
243,i do not know answered boq gravely for i have never been there
244,it is better for people to keep away from oz unless they have business with him
245,but it is a long way to the emerald city and it will take you many days
246,the country here is rich and pleasant but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey
247,this worried dorothy a little but she knew that only the great oz could help her get to kansas again so she bravely resolved not to turn back
248,she bade her friends good bye and again started along the road of yellow brick
249,when she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down
250,there was a great cornfield beyond the fence and not far away she saw a scarecrow placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn
251,dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the scarecrow
252,its head was a small sack stuffed with straw with eyes nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face
253,an old pointed blue hat that had belonged to some munchkin was perched on his head and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes worn and faded which had also been stuffed with straw
254,on the feet were some old boots with blue tops such as every man wore in this country and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back
255,while dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer painted face of the scarecrow she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her
256,she thought she must have been mistaken at first for none of the scarecrows in kansas ever wink but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way
257,then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it while toto ran around the pole and barked
258,good day said the scarecrow in a rather husky voice
259,did you speak
260,asked the girl in wonder
261,certainly answered the scarecrow
262,how do you do
263,I am pretty well thank you replied dorothy politely
264,how do you do
265,I am not feeling well said the scarecrow with a smile for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows
266,cannot you get down
267,asked dorothy
268,no for this pole is stuck up my back
269,if you will please take away the pole i shall be greatly obliged to you
270,dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole for being stuffed with straw it was quite light
271,thank you very much said the scarecrow when he had been set down on the ground
272,i feel like a new man
273,dorothy was puzzled at this for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak and to see him bow and walk along beside her
274,who are you
275,asked the scarecrow when he had stretched himself and yawned
276,and where are you going
277,my name is dorothy said the girl and i am going to the emerald city to ask the great oz to send me back to kansas
278,where is the emerald city
279,he inquired
280,and who is oz
281,why do not you know
282,she returned in surprise
283,no indeed
284,i do not know anything
285,you see i am stuffed so i have no brains at all he answered sadly
286,oh said dorothy I am awfully sorry for you
287,do you think he asked if i go to the emerald city with you that oz would give me some brains
288,i cannot tell she returned but you may come with me if you like
289,if oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you are now
290,that is true said the scarecrow
291,you see he continued confidentially i do not mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed because i cannot get hurt
292,if anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin into me it does not matter for i cannot feel it
293,but i do not want people to call me a fool and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead of with brains as yours is how am i ever to know anything
294,i understand how you feel said the little girl who was truly sorry for him
295,if you will come with me ill ask oz to do all he can for you
296,thank you he answered gratefully
297,they walked back to the road
298,dorothy helped him over the fence and they started along the path of yellow brick for the emerald city
299,toto did not like this addition to the party at first
300,he smelled around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the scarecrow
301,do not mind toto said dorothy to her new friend
302,he never bites
303,oh I am not afraid replied the scarecrow
304,he cannot hurt the straw
305,do let me carry that basket for you
306,i shall not mind it for i cannot get tired
307,ill tell you a secret he continued as he walked along
308,there is only one thing in the world i am afraid of
309,what is that
310,asked dorothy the munchkin farmer who made you
311,no answered the scarecrow its a lighted match
312,the road through the forest
313,after a few hours the road began to be rough and the walking grew so difficult that the scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks which were here very uneven
314,sometimes indeed they were broken or missing altogether leaving holes that toto jumped across and dorothy walked around
315,as for the scarecrow having no brains he walked straight ahead and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks
316,it never hurt him however and dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap
317,the farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back
318,there were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became
319,at noon they sat down by the roadside near a little brook and dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread
320,she offered a piece to the scarecrow but he refused
321,i am never hungry he said and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head
322,dorothy saw at once that this was true so she only nodded and went on eating her bread
323,tell me something about yourself and the country you came from said the scarecrow when she had finished her dinner
324,so she told him all about kansas and how gray everything was there and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer land of oz
325,the scarecrow listened carefully and said i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas
326,that is because you have no brains answered the girl
327,no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful
328,there is no place like home
329,the scarecrow sighed
330,of course i cannot understand it he said
331,if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all
332,it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains
333,will not you tell me a story while we are resting
334,asked the child
335,the scarecrow looked at her reproachfully and answered
336,my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever
337,i was only made day before yesterday
338,what happened in the world before that time is all unknown to me
339,luckily when the farmer made my head one of the first things he did was to paint my ears so that i heard what was going on
340,there was another munchkin with him and the first thing i heard was the farmer saying how do you like those ears
341,they are not straight answered the other
342,never mind said the farmer
343,they are ears just the same which was true enough
344,now ill make the eyes said the farmer
345,so he painted my right eye and as soon as it was finished i found myself looking at him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity for this was my first glimpse of the world
346,that is a rather pretty eye remarked the munchkin who was watching the farmer
347,blue paint is just the color for eyes
348,i think ill make the other a little bigger said the farmer
349,and when the second eye was done i could see much better than before
350,then he made my nose and my mouth
351,but i did not speak because at that time i did not know what a mouth was for
352,i had the fun of watching them make my body and my arms and legs and when they fastened on my head at last i felt very proud for i thought i was just as good a man as anyone
353,this fellow will scare the crows fast enough said the farmer
354,he looks just like a man
355,why he is a man said the other and i quite agreed with him
356,the farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick where you found me
357,he and his friend soon after walked away and left me alone
358,i did not like to be deserted this way
359,so i tried to walk after them
360,but my feet would not touch the ground and i was forced to stay on that pole
361,it was a lonely life to lead for i had nothing to think of having been made such a little while before
362,many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield but as soon as they saw me they flew away again thinking i was a munchkin and this pleased me and made me feel that i was quite an important person
363,by and by an old crow flew near me and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and said
364,i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner
365,any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw
366,then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted
367,the other birds seeing he was not harmed by me came to eat the corn too so in a short time there was a great flock of them about me
368,i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good scarecrow after all but the old crow comforted me saying if you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them and a better man than some of them
369,brains are the only things worth having in this world no matter whether one is a crow or a man
370,after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains
371,by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city
372,i hope so said dorothy earnestly since you seem anxious to have them
373,oh yes i am anxious returned the scarecrow
374,it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool
375,well said the girl let us go
376,and she handed the basket to the scarecrow
377,there were no fences at all by the roadside now and the land was rough and untilled
378,toward evening they came to a great forest where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick
379,it was almost dark under the trees for the branches shut out the daylight but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest
380,if this road goes in it must come out said the scarecrow and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us
381,anyone would know that said dorothy
382,certainly that is why i know it returned the scarecrow
383,if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it
384,after an hour or so the light faded away and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness
385,dorothy could not see at all but toto could for some dogs see very well in the dark and the scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day
386,so she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well
387,if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night she said you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark
388,soon after the scarecrow stopped
389,i see a little cottage at the right of us he said built of logs and branches
390,shall we go there
391,yes indeed answered the child
392,i am all tired out
393,so the scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage and dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner
394,she lay down at once and with toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep
395,the scarecrow who was never tired stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning came
396,the rescue of the tin woodman
397,when dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels
398,she sat up and looked around her
399,there was the scarecrow still standing patiently in his corner waiting for her
400,we must go and search for water she said to him
401,why do you want water
402,he asked
403,to wash my face clean after the dust of the road and to drink so the dry bread will not stick in my throat
404,it must be inconvenient to be made of flesh said the scarecrow thoughtfully for you must sleep and eat and drink
405,however you have brains and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly
406,they left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water where dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast
407,she saw there was not much bread left in the basket and the girl was thankful the scarecrow did not have to eat anything for there was scarcely enough for herself and toto for the day
408,when she had finished her meal and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick she was startled to hear a deep groan near by
409,what was that
410,she asked timidly
411,i cannot imagine replied the scarecrow but we can go and see
412,just then another groan reached their ears and the sound seemed to come from behind them
413,they turned and walked through the forest a few steps when dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees
414,she ran to the place and then stopped short with a little cry of surprise
415,one of the big trees had been partly chopped through and standing beside it with an uplifted axe in his hands was a man made entirely of tin
416,his head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body but he stood perfectly motionless as if he could not stir at all
417,dorothy looked at him in amazement and so did the scarecrow while toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs which hurt his teeth
418,did you groan
419,asked dorothy
420,yes answered the tin man i did
421,I have been groaning for more than a year and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me
422,what can i do for you
423,she inquired softly for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke
424,get an oil can and oil my joints he answered
425,they are rusted so badly that i cannot move them at all if i am well oiled i shall soon be all right again
426,you will find an oil can on a shelf in my cottage
427,dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil can and then she returned and asked anxiously where are your joints
428,oil my neck first replied the tin woodman
429,so she oiled it and as it was quite badly rusted the scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely and then the man could turn it himself
430,now oil the joints in my arms he said
431,and dorothy oiled them and the scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new
432,the tin woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe which he leaned against the tree
433,this is a great comfort he said
434,i have been holding that axe in the air ever since i rusted and I am glad to be able to put it down at last
435,now if you will oil the joints of my legs i shall be all right once more
436,so they oiled his legs until he could move them freely and he thanked them again and again for his release for he seemed a very polite creature and very grateful
437,i might have stood there always if you had not come along he said so you have certainly saved my life
438,how did you happen to be here
439,we are on our way to the emerald city to see the great oz she answered and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night
440,why do you wish to see oz
441,he asked
442,i want him to send me back to kansas and the scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head she replied
443,the tin woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment
444,then he said
445,do you suppose oz could give me a heart
446,why i guess so dorothy answered
447,it would be as easy as to give the scarecrow brains
448,true the tin woodman returned
449,so if you will allow me to join your party i will also go to the emerald city and ask oz to help me
450,come along said the scarecrow heartily and dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company
451,so the tin woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick
452,the tin woodman had asked dorothy to put the oil can in her basket
453,for he said if i should get caught in the rain and rust again i would need the oil can badly
454,it was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass
455,but the tin woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party
456,dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road
457,indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again
458,why did not you walk around the hole
459,asked the tin woodman
460,i do not know enough replied the scarecrow cheerfully
461,my head is stuffed with straw you know and that is why i am going to oz to ask him for some brains
462,oh i see said the tin woodman
463,but after all brains are not the best things in the world
464,have you any
465,inquired the scarecrow
466,no my head is quite empty answered the woodman
467,but once i had brains and a heart also so having tried them both i should much rather have a heart
468,and why is that
469,asked the scarecrow
470,i will tell you my story and then you will know
471,so while they were walking through the forest the tin woodman told the following story
472,i was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living
473,when i grew up i too became a woodchopper and after my father died i took care of my old mother as long as she lived
474,then i made up my mind that instead of living alone i would marry so that i might not become lonely
475,there was one of the munchkin girls who was so beautiful that i soon grew to love her with all my heart
476,she on her part promised to marry me as soon as i could earn enough money to build a better house for her so i set to work harder than ever
477,but the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework
478,so the old woman went to the wicked witch of the east and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage
479,thereupon the wicked witch enchanted my axe and when i was chopping away at my best one day for i was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg
480,this at first seemed a great misfortune for i knew a one legged man could not do very well as a wood chopper
481,so i went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin
482,the leg worked very well once i was used to it
483,but my action angered the wicked witch of the east for she had promised the old woman i should not marry the pretty munchkin girl
484,when i began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg
485,again i went to the tinsmith and again he made me a leg out of tin
486,after this the enchanted axe cut off my arms one after the other but nothing daunted i had them replaced with tin ones
487,the wicked witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head and at first i thought that was the end of me
488,but the tinsmith happened to come along and he made me a new head out of tin
489,i thought i had beaten the wicked witch then and i worked harder than ever but i little knew how cruel my enemy could be
490,she thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden and made my axe slip again so that it cut right through my body splitting me into two halves
491,once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it by means of joints so that i could move around as well as ever
492,but alas
493,i had now no heart so that i lost all my love for the munchkin girl and did not care whether i married her or not
494,i suppose she is still living with the old woman waiting for me to come after her
495,my body shone so brightly in the sun that i felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped for it could not cut me
496,there was only one dangerthat my joints would rust but i kept an oil can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever i needed it
497,however there came a day when i forgot to do this and being caught in a rainstorm before i thought of the danger my joints had rusted and i was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me
498,it was a terrible thing to undergo but during the year i stood there i had time to think that the greatest loss i had known was the loss of my heart
499,while i was in love i was the happiest man on earth but no one can love who has not a heart and so i am resolved to ask oz to give me one
500,if he does i will go back to the munchkin maiden and marry her
501,both dorothy and the scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the tin woodman and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart
502,all the same said the scarecrow i shall ask for brains instead of a heart for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one
503,i shall take the heart returned the tin woodman for brains do not make one happy and happiness is the best thing in the world
504,dorothy did not say anything for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right and she decided if she could only get back to kansas and aunt them it did not matter so much whether the woodman had no brains and the scarecrow no heart or each got what he wanted
505,what worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone and another meal for herself and toto would empty the basket
506,to be sure neither the woodman nor the scarecrow ever ate anything but she was not made of tin nor straw and could not live unless she was fed
507,the cowardly lion
508,all this time dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods
509,the road was still paved with yellow brick but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees and the walking was not at all good
510,there were few birds in this part of the forest for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine
511,but now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees
512,these sounds made the little girls heart beat fast for she did not know what made them but toto knew and he walked close to dorothys side and did not even bark in return
513,how long will it be the child asked of the tin woodman before we are out of the forest
514,i cannot tell was the answer for i have never been to the emerald city
515,but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful
516,but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witchs kiss and that will protect you from harm
517,but toto said the girl anxiously
518,what will protect him
519,we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger replied the tin woodman
520,just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar and the next moment a great lion bounded into the road
521,with one blow of his paw he sent the scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road and then he struck at the tin woodman with his sharp claws
522,but to the lions surprise he could make no impression on the tin although the woodman fell over in the road and lay still
523,little toto now that he had an enemy to face ran barking toward the lion and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog when dorothy fearing toto would be killed and heedless of danger rushed forward and slapped the lion upon his nose as hard as she could while she cried out
524,do not you dare to bite toto
525,you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog
526,i did not bite him said the lion as he rubbed his nose with his paw where dorothy had hit it
527,no but you tried to she retorted
528,you are nothing but a big coward
529,i know it said the lion hanging his head in shame
530,I have always known it
531,but how can i help it
532,i do not know I am sure
533,to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow
534,is he stuffed
535,asked the lion in surprise as he watched her pick up the scarecrow and set him upon his feet while she patted him into shape again
536,of course hes stuffed replied dorothy who was still angry
537,that is why he went over so easily remarked the lion
538,it astonished me to see him whirl around so
539,is the other one stuffed also
540,no said dorothy hes made of tin
541,and she helped the woodman up again
542,that is why he nearly blunted my claws said the lion
543,when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back
544,what is that little animal you are so tender of
545,he is my dog toto answered dorothy
546,is he made of tin or stuffed
547,asked the lion
548,neither
549,hes aaa meat dog said the girl
550,hes a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him
551,no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me continued the lion sadly
552,what makes you a coward
553,asked dorothy looking at the great beast in wonder for he was as big as a small horse
554,its a mystery replied the lion
555,i suppose i was born that way
556,all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts
557,i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way
558,whenever I have met a man I have been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go
559,if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myselfim such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go
560,but that is not right
561,the king of beasts should not be a coward said the scarecrow
562,i know it returned the lion wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail
563,it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy
564,but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast
565,perhaps you have heart disease said the tin woodman
566,it may be said the lion
567,if you have continued the tin woodman you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart
568,for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease
569,perhaps said the lion thoughtfully if i had no heart i should not be a coward
570,have you brains
571,asked the scarecrow
572,i suppose so
573,I have never looked to see replied the lion
574,i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some remarked the scarecrow for my head is stuffed with straw
575,and i am going to ask him to give me a heart said the woodman
576,and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas added dorothy
577,do you think oz could give me courage
578,asked the cowardly lion
579,just as easily as he could give me brains said the scarecrow
580,or give me a heart said the tin woodman
581,or send me back to kansas said dorothy
582,then if you do not mind ill go with you said the lion for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage
583,you will be very welcome answered dorothy for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts
584,it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily
585,they really are said the lion but that does not make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy
586,so once more the little company set off upon the journey the lion walking with stately strides at dorothys side
587,toto did not approve of this new comrade at first for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the lions great jaws
588,but after a time he became more at ease and presently toto and the cowardly lion had grown to be good friends
589,during the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey
590,once indeed the tin woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road and killed the poor little thing
591,this made the tin woodman very unhappy for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret
592,these tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw and there they rusted
593,when dorothy presently asked him a question the tin woodman could not open his mouth for his jaws were tightly rusted together
594,he became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to dorothy to relieve him but she could not understand
595,the lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong
596,but the scarecrow seized the oil can from dorothys basket and oiled the woodmans jaws so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before
597,this will serve me a lesson said he to look where i step
598,for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak
599,thereafter he walked very carefully with his eyes on the road and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it so as not to harm it
600,the tin woodman knew very well he had no heart and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything
601,you people with hearts he said have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful
602,when oz gives me a heart of course i need not mind so much
603,the journey to the great oz
604,they were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest for there were no houses near
605,the tree made a good thick covering to protect them from the dew and the tin woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely
606,she and toto ate the last of their bread and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast
607,if you wish said the lion i will go into the forest and kill a deer for you
608,you can roast it by the fire since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food and then you will have a very good breakfast
609,do not
610,please do not begged the tin woodman
611,i should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer and then my jaws would rust again
612,but the lion went away into the forest and found his own supper and no one ever knew what it was for he did not mention it
613,and the scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled dorothys basket with them so that she would not be hungry for a long time
614,she thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the scarecrow but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts
615,his padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket
616,but the scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket for it enabled him to keep away from the fire as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up
617,so he kept a good distance away from the flames and only came near to cover dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep
618,these kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning
619,when it was daylight the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook and soon after they all started toward the emerald city
620,this was to be an eventful day for the travelers
621,they had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side
622,it was a very wide ditch and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep and there were many big jagged rocks at the bottom
623,the sides were so steep that none of them could climb down and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end
624,what shall we do
625,asked dorothy despairingly
626,i have not the faintest idea said the tin woodman and the lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful
627,but the scarecrow said we cannot fly that is certain
628,neither can we climb down into this great ditch
629,therefore if we cannot jump over it we must stop where we are
630,i think i could jump over it said the cowardly lion after measuring the distance carefully in his mind
631,then we are all right answered the scarecrow for you can carry us all over on your back one at a time
632,well ill try it said the lion
633,who will go first
634,i will declared the scarecrow for if you found that you could not jump over the gulf dorothy would be killed or the tin woodman badly dented on the rocks below
635,but if i am on your back it will not matter so much for the fall would not hurt me at all
636,i am terribly afraid of falling myself said the cowardly lion but i suppose there is nothing to do but try it
637,so get on my back and we will make the attempt
638,the scarecrow sat upon the lions back and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down
639,why do not you run and jump
640,asked the scarecrow
641,because that is not the way we lions do these things he replied
642,then giving a great spring he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side
643,they were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it and after the scarecrow had got down from his back the lion sprang across the ditch again
644,dorothy thought she would go next so she took toto in her arms and climbed on the lions back holding tightly to his mane with one hand
645,the next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air and then before she had time to think about it she was safe on the other side
646,the lion went back a third time and got the tin woodman and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest for his great leaps had made his breath short and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long
647,they found the forest very thick on this side and it looked dark and gloomy
648,after the lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick silently wondering each in his own mind if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again
649,to add to their discomfort they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest and the lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the kalidahs lived
650,what are the kalidahs
651,asked the girl
652,they are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers replied the lion and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as i could kill toto
653,I am terribly afraid of the kalidahs
654,I am not surprised that you are returned dorothy
655,they must be dreadful beasts
656,the lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road
657,but this one was so broad and deep that the lion knew at once he could not leap across it
658,so they sat down to consider what they should do and after serious thought the scarecrow said
659,here is a great tree standing close to the ditch
660,if the tin woodman can chop it down so that it will fall to the other side we can walk across it easily
661,that is a first rate idea said the lion
662,one would almost suspect you had brains in your head instead of straw
663,the woodman set to work at once and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through
664,then the lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch with its top branches on the other side
665,they had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers
666,they are the kalidahs said the cowardly lion beginning to tremble
667,quick cried the scarecrow
668,let us cross over
669,so dorothy went first holding toto in her arms the tin woodman followed and the scarecrow came next
670,the lion although he was certainly afraid turned to face the kalidahs and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that dorothy screamed and the scarecrow fell over backward while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise
671,but seeing they were bigger than the lion and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him the kalidahs again rushed forward and the lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next
672,without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree
673,and the lion said to dorothy
674,we are lost for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws
675,but stand close behind me and i will fight them as long as i am alive
676,wait a minute called the scarecrow
677,he had been thinking what was best to be done and now he asked the woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch
678,the tin woodman began to use his axe at once and just as the two kalidahs were nearly across the tree fell with a crash into the gulf carrying the ugly snarling brutes with it and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom
679,well said the cowardly lion drawing a long breath of relief i see we are going to live a little while longer and i am glad of it for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive
680,those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet
681,ah said the tin woodman sadly i wish i had a heart to beat
682,this adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest and they walked so fast that dorothy became tired and had to ride on the lions back
683,to their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river flowing swiftly just before them
684,on the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits
685,they were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them
686,how shall we cross the river
687,asked dorothy
688,that is easily done replied the scarecrow
689,the tin woodman must build us a raft so we can float to the other side
690,so the woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft and while he was busy at this the scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit
691,this pleased dorothy who had eaten nothing but nuts all day and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit
692,but it takes time to make a raft even when one is as industrious and untiring as the tin woodman and when night came the work was not done
693,so they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning and dorothy dreamed of the emerald city and of the good wizard oz who would soon send her back to her own home again
694,the deadly poppy field
695,our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope and dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river
696,behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through although they had suffered many discouragements but before them was a lovely sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the emerald city
697,to be sure the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land
698,but the raft was nearly done and after the tin woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins they were ready to start
699,dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held toto in her arms
700,when the cowardly lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly for he was big and heavy but the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood upon the other end to steady it and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water
701,they got along quite well at first but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick
702,and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom
703,this is bad said the tin woodman for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the wicked witch of the west and she will enchant us and make us her slaves
704,and then i should get no brains said the scarecrow
705,and i should get no courage said the cowardly lion
706,and i should get no heart said the tin woodman
707,and i should never get back to kansas said dorothy
708,we must certainly get to the emerald city if we can the scarecrow continued and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river
709,then before he could pull it out againor let gothe raft was swept away and the poor scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river
710,good bye he called after them and they were very sorry to leave him
711,indeed the tin woodman began to cry but fortunately remembered that he might rust and so dried his tears on dorothys apron
712,of course this was a bad thing for the scarecrow
713,i am now worse off than when i first met dorothy he thought
714,then i was stuck on a pole in a cornfield where i could make believe scare the crows at any rate
715,but surely there is no use for a scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river
716,i am afraid i shall never have any brains after all
717,down the stream the raft floated and the poor scarecrow was left far behind
718,then the lion said
719,something must be done to save us
720,i think i can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail
721,so he sprang into the water and the tin woodman caught fast hold of his tail
722,then the lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore
723,it was hard work although he was so big but by and by they were drawn out of the current and then dorothy took the tin woodmans long pole and helped push the raft to the land
724,they were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the emerald city
725,what shall we do now
726,asked the tin woodman as the lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him
727,we must get back to the road in some way said dorothy
728,the best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again remarked the lion
729,so when they were rested dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank to the road from which the river had carried them
730,it was a lovely country with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them and had they not felt so sorry for the poor scarecrow they could have been very happy
731,they walked along as fast as they could dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower and after a time the tin woodman cried out look
732,then they all looked at the river and saw the scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water looking very lonely and sad
733,what can we do to save him
734,asked dorothy
735,the lion and the woodman both shook their heads for they did not know
736,so they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the scarecrow until a stork flew by who upon seeing them stopped to rest at the waters edge
737,who are you and where are you going
738,asked the stork
739,i am dorothy answered the girl and these are my friends the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and we are going to the emerald city
740,this is not the road said the stork as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party
741,i know it returned dorothy but we have lost the scarecrow and are wondering how we shall get him again
742,where is he
743,asked the stork
744,over there in the river answered the little girl
745,if he was not so big and heavy i would get him for you remarked the stork
746,he is not heavy a bit said dorothy eagerly for he is stuffed with straw and if you will bring him back to us we shall thank you ever and ever so much
747,well ill try said the stork but if i find he is too heavy to carry i shall have to drop him in the river again
748,so the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the scarecrow was perched upon his pole
749,then the stork with her great claws grabbed the scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank where dorothy and the lion and the tin woodman and toto were sitting
750,when the scarecrow found himself among his friends again he was so happy that he hugged them all even the lion and toto and as they walked along he sang tol de ri de oh at every step he felt so gay
751,i was afraid i should have to stay in the river forever he said but the kind stork saved me and if i ever get any brains i shall find the stork again and do her some kindness in return
752,that is all right said the stork who was flying along beside them
753,i always like to help anyone in trouble
754,but i must go now for my babies are waiting in the nest for me i hope you will find the emerald city and that oz will help you
755,thank you replied dorothy and then the kind stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight
756,they walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them
757,there were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms besides great clusters of scarlet poppies which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled dorothys eyes
758,are not they beautiful
759,the girl asked as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers
760,i suppose so answered the scarecrow
761,when i have brains i shall probably like them better
762,if i only had a heart i should love them added the tin woodman
763,i always did like flowers said the lion
764,they seem so helpless and frail
765,but there are none in the forest so bright as these
766,they now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies and fewer and fewer of the other flowers and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies
767,now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever
768,but dorothy did not know this nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep
769,but the tin woodman would not let her do this
770,we must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark he said and the scarecrow agreed with him
771,so they kept walking until dorothy could stand no longer
772,her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies fast asleep
773,what shall we do
774,asked the tin woodman
775,if we leave her here she will die said the lion
776,the smell of the flowers is killing us all
777,i myself can scarcely keep my eyes open and the dog is asleep already
778,it was true toto had fallen down beside his little mistress
779,but the scarecrow and the tin woodman not being made of flesh were not troubled by the scent of the flowers
780,run fast said the scarecrow to the lion and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can
781,we will bring the little girl with us but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried
782,so the lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go
783,in a moment he was out of sight
784,let us make a chair with our hands and carry her said the scarecrow
785,so they picked up toto and put the dog in dorothys lap and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers
786,on and on they walked and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end
787,they followed the bend of the river and at last came upon their friend the lion lying fast asleep among the poppies
788,the flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them
789,we can do nothing for him said the tin woodman sadly for he is much too heavy to lift
790,we must leave him here to sleep on forever and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last
791,I am sorry said the scarecrow
792,the lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly
793,but let us go on
794,they carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her
795,the queen of the field mice
796,we cannot be far from the road of yellow brick now remarked the scarecrow as he stood beside the girl for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away
797,the tin woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl and turning his head which worked beautifully on hinges he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them
798,it was indeed a great yellow wildcat and the woodman thought it must be chasing something for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open showing two rows of ugly teeth while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire
799,as it came nearer the tin woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty harmless creature
800,so the woodman raised his axe and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beasts head clean off from its body and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces
801,the field mouse now that it was freed from its enemy stopped short and coming slowly up to the woodman it said in a squeaky little voice
802,oh thank you
803,thank you ever so much for saving my life
804,do not speak of it i beg of you replied the woodman
805,i have no heart you know so i am careful to help all those who may need a friend even if it happens to be only a mouse
806,only a mouse cried the little animal indignantly
807,why i am a queenthe queen of all the field mice
808,oh indeed said the woodman making a bow
809,therefore you have done a great deed as well as a brave one in saving my life added the queen
810,at that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them and when they saw their queen they exclaimed
811,oh your majesty we thought you would be killed
812,how did you manage to escape the great wildcat
813,they all bowed so low to the little queen that they almost stood upon their heads
814,this funny tin man she answered killed the wildcat and saved my life
815,so hereafter you must all serve him and obey his slightest wish
816,we will cried all the mice in a shrill chorus
817,and then they scampered in all directions for toto had awakened from his sleep and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group
818,toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in kansas and he saw no harm in it
819,but the tin woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight while he called to the mice come back
820,come back
821,toto shall not hurt you
822,at this the queen of the mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked in a timid voice are you sure he will not bite us
823,i will not let him said the woodman so do not be afraid
824,one by one the mice came creeping back and toto did not bark again although he tried to get out of the woodmans arms and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin
825,finally one of the biggest mice spoke
826,is there anything we can do it asked to repay you for saving the life of our queen
827,nothing that i know of answered the woodman but the scarecrow who had been trying to think but could not because his head was stuffed with straw said quickly oh yes you can save our friend the cowardly lion who is asleep in the poppy bed
828,a lion cried the little queen
829,why he would eat us all up
830,oh no declared the scarecrow this lion is a coward
831,really
832,asked the mouse
833,he says so himself answered the scarecrow and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend
834,if you will help us to save him i promise that he shall treat you all with kindness
835,very well said the queen we trust you
836,but what shall we do
837,are there many of these mice which call you queen and are willing to obey you
838,oh yes there are thousands she replied
839,then send for them all to come here as soon as possible and let each one bring a long piece of string
840,the queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people
841,as soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible
842,now said the scarecrow to the tin woodman you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the lion
843,so the woodman went at once to the trees and began to work and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches
844,he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk
845,so fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them
846,they came from all directions and there were thousands of them big mice and little mice and middle sized mice and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth
847,it was about this time that dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes
848,she was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly
849,but the scarecrow told her about everything and turning to the dignified little mouse he said
850,permit me to introduce to you her majesty the queen
851,dorothy nodded gravely and the queen made a curtsy after which she became quite friendly with the little girl
852,the scarecrow and the woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck using the strings they had brought
853,one end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck
854,of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily
855,even the scarecrow and the tin woodman could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the lion lay asleep
856,after a great deal of hard work for the lion was heavy they managed to get him up on the truck
857,then the queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep
858,at first the little creatures many though they were could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck but the woodman and the scarecrow both pushed from behind and they got along better
859,soon they rolled the lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields where he could breathe the sweet fresh air again instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers
860,dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death
861,she had grown so fond of the big lion she was glad he had been rescued
862,then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes
863,the queen of the mice was the last to leave
864,if ever you need us again she said come out into the field and call and we shall hear you and come to your assistance
865,good bye
866,good bye they all answered and away the queen ran while dorothy held toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her
867,after this they sat down beside the lion until he should awaken and the scarecrow brought dorothy some fruit from a tree near by which she ate for her dinner
868,the guardian of the gate
869,it was some time before the cowardly lion awakened for he had lain among the poppies a long while breathing in their deadly fragrance but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive
870,i ran as fast as i could he said sitting down and yawning but the flowers were too strong for me
871,how did you get me out
872,then they told him of the field mice and how they had generously saved him from death and the cowardly lion laughed and said
873,i have always thought myself very big and terrible yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me and such small animals as mice have saved my life
874,how strange it all is
875,but comrades what shall we do now
876,we must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again said dorothy and then we can keep on to the emerald city
877,so the lion being fully refreshed and feeling quite himself again they all started upon the journey greatly enjoying the walk through the soft fresh grass and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the emerald city where the great oz dwelt
878,the road was smooth and well paved now and the country about was beautiful so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades
879,once more they could see fences built beside the road but these were painted green and when they came to a small house in which a farmer evidently lived that also was painted green
880,they passed by several of these houses during the afternoon and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great lion of which they were very much afraid
881,the people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald green color and wore peaked hats like those of the munchkins
882,this must be the land of oz said dorothy and we are surely getting near the emerald city
883,yes answered the scarecrow
884,everything is green here while in the country of the munchkins blue was the favorite color
885,but the people do not seem to be as friendly as the munchkins and I am afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night
886,i should like something to eat besides fruit said the girl and I am sure toto is nearly starved
887,let us stop at the next house and talk to the people
888,so when they came to a good sized farmhouse dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked
889,a woman opened it just far enough to look out and said what do you want child and why is that great lion with you
890,we wish to pass the night with you if you will allow us answered dorothy and the lion is my friend and comrade and would not hurt you for the world
891,is he tame
892,asked the woman opening the door a little wider
893,oh yes said the girl and he is a great coward too
894,he will be more afraid of you than you are of him
895,well said the woman after thinking it over and taking another peep at the lion if that is the case you may come in and i will give you some supper and a place to sleep
896,so they all entered the house where there were besides the woman two children and a man
897,the man had hurt his leg and was lying on the couch in a corner
898,they seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked
899,where are you all going
900,to the emerald city said dorothy to see the great oz
901,oh indeed exclaimed the man
902,are you sure that oz will see you
903,why not
904,she replied
905,why it is said that he never let us anyone come into his presence
906,i have been to the emerald city many times and it is a beautiful and wonderful place but i have never been permitted to see the great oz nor do i know of any living person who has seen him
907,does he never go out
908,asked the scarecrow
909,never
910,he sits day after day in the great throne room of his palace and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face
911,what is he like
912,asked the girl
913,that is hard to tell said the man thoughtfully
914,you see oz is a great wizard and can take on any form he wishes
915,so that some say he looks like a bird and some say he looks like an elephant and some say he looks like a cat
916,to others he appears as a beautiful fairy or a brownie or in any other form that pleases him
917,but who the real oz is when he is in his own form no living person can tell
918,that is very strange said dorothy but we must try in some way to see him or we shall have made our journey for nothing
919,why do you wish to see the terrible oz
920,asked the man
921,i want him to give me some brains said the scarecrow eagerly
922,oh oz could do that easily enough declared the man
923,he has more brains than he needs
924,and i want him to give me a heart said the tin woodman
925,that will not trouble him continued the man for oz has a large collection of hearts of all sizes and shapes
926,and i want him to give me courage said the cowardly lion
927,oz keeps a great pot of courage in his throne room said the man which he has covered with a golden plate to keep it from running over
928,he will be glad to give you some
929,and i want him to send me back to kansas said dorothy
930,where is kansas
931,asked the man with surprise
932,i do not know replied dorothy sorrowfully but it is my home and I am sure its somewhere
933,very likely
934,well oz can do anything so i suppose he will find kansas for you
935,but first you must get to see him and that will be a hard task for the great wizard does not like to see anyone and he usually has his own way
936,but what do you want
937,he continued speaking to toto
938,toto only wagged his tail for strange to say he could not speak
939,the woman now called to them that supper was ready so they gathered around the table and dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread and enjoyed her meal
940,the lion ate some of the porridge but did not care for it saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses not for lions
941,the scarecrow and the tin woodman ate nothing at all
942,toto ate a little of everything and was glad to get a good supper again
943,the woman now gave dorothy a bed to sleep in and toto lay down beside her while the lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed
944,the scarecrow and the tin woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night although of course they could not sleep
945,the next morning as soon as the sun was up they started on their way and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them
946,that must be the emerald city said dorothy
947,as they walked on the green glow became brighter and brighter and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels
948,yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the city
949,it was high and thick and of a bright green color
950,in front of them and at the end of the road of yellow brick was a big gate all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy
951,there was a bell beside the gate and dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within
952,then the big gate swung slowly open and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds
953,before them stood a little man about the same size as the munchkins
954,he was clothed all in green from his head to his feet and even his skin was of a greenish tint
955,at his side was a large green box
956,when he saw dorothy and her companions the man asked what do you wish in the emerald city
957,we came here to see the great oz said dorothy
958,the man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over
959,it has been many years since anyone asked me to see oz he said shaking his head in perplexity
960,he is powerful and terrible and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the great wizard he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant
961,but it is not a foolish errand nor an idle one replied the scarecrow it is important
962,and we have been told that oz is a good wizard
963,so he is said the green man and he rules the emerald city wisely and well
964,but to those who are not honest or who approach him from curiosity he is most terrible and few have ever dared ask to see his face
965,i am the guardian of the gates and since you demand to see the great oz i must take you to his palace
966,but first you must put on the spectacles
967,why
968,asked dorothy
969,because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the emerald city would blind you
970,even those who live in the city must wear spectacles night and day
971,they are all locked on for oz so ordered it when the city was first built and i have the only key that will unlock them
972,he opened the big box and dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape
973,all of them had green glasses in them
974,the guardian of the gates found a pair that would just fit dorothy and put them over her eyes
975,there were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the guardian of the gates wore around his neck
976,when they were on dorothy could not take them off had she wished but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the emerald city so she said nothing
977,then the green man fitted spectacles for the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion and even on little toto and all were locked fast with the key
978,then the guardian of the gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the palace
979,taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall he opened another gate and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the emerald city
980,the wonderful city of oz
981,even with eyes protected by the green spectacles dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful city
982,the streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds
983,they walked over a pavement of the same green marble and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds set closely and glittering in the brightness of the sun
984,the window panes were of green glass even the sky above the city had a green tint and the rays of the sun were green
985,there were many peoplemen women and childrenwalking about and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins
986,they looked at dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the lion but no one spoke to them
987,many shops stood in the street and dorothy saw that everything in them was green
988,green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale as well as green shoes green hats and green clothes of all sorts
989,at one place a man was selling green lemonade and when the children bought it dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies
990,there seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind the men carried things around in little green carts which they pushed before them
991,everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous
992,the guardian of the gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building exactly in the middle of the city which was the palace of oz the great wizard
993,there was a soldier before the door dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard
994,here are strangers said the guardian of the gates to him and they demand to see the great oz
995,step inside answered the soldier and i will carry your message to him
996,so they passed through the palace gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds
997,the soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room and when they were seated he said politely
998,please make yourselves comfortable while i go to the door of the throne room and tell oz you are here
999,they had to wait a long time before the soldier returned
1000,when at last he came back dorothy asked
1001,have you seen oz
1002,oh no returned the soldier i have never seen him
1003,but i spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message
1004,he said he will grant you an audience if you so desire but each one of you must enter his presence alone and he will admit but one each day
1005,therefore as you must remain in the palace for several days i will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey
1006,thank you replied the girl that is very kind of oz
1007,the soldier now blew upon a green whistle and at once a young girl dressed in a pretty green silk gown entered the room
1008,she had lovely green hair and green eyes and she bowed low before dorothy as she said follow me and i will show you your room
1009,so dorothy said good bye to all her friends except toto and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the palace
1010,it was the sweetest little room in the world with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane
1011,there was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room that shot a spray of green perfume into the air to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin
1012,beautiful green flowers stood in the windows and there was a shelf with a row of little green books
1013,when dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh they were so funny
1014,in a wardrobe were many green dresses made of silk and satin and velvet and all of them fitted dorothy exactly
1015,make yourself perfectly at home said the green girl and if you wish for anything ring the bell
1016,oz will send for you tomorrow morning
1017,she left dorothy alone and went back to the others
1018,these she also led to rooms and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the palace
1019,of course this politeness was wasted on the scarecrow for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot just within the doorway to wait till morning
1020,it would not rest him to lie down and he could not close his eyes so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world
1021,the tin woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit for he remembered when he was made of flesh but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order
1022,the lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest and did not like being shut up in a room but he had too much sense to let this worry him so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute
1023,the next morning after breakfast the green maiden came to fetch dorothy and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns made of green brocaded satin
1024,dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around totos neck and they started for the throne room of the great oz
1025,first they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court all dressed in rich costumes
1026,these people had nothing to do but talk to each other but they always came to wait outside the throne room every morning although they were never permitted to see oz
1027,as dorothy entered they looked at her curiously and one of them whispered
1028,are you really going to look upon the face of oz the terrible
1029,of course answered the girl if he will see me
1030,oh he will see you said the soldier who had taken her message to the wizard although he does not like to have people ask to see him
1031,indeed at first he was angry and said i should send you back where you came from
1032,then he asked me what you looked like and when i mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested
1033,at last i told him about the mark upon your forehead and he decided he would admit you to his presence
1034,just then a bell rang and the green girl said to dorothy that is the signal
1035,you must go into the throne room alone
1036,she opened a little door and dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place
1037,it was a big round room with a high arched roof and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together
1038,in the center of the roof was a great light as bright as the sun which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner
1039,but what interested dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room
1040,it was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems as did everything else
1041,in the center of the chair was an enormous head without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever
1042,there was no hair upon this head but it had eyes and a nose and mouth and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant
1043,as dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily
1044,then the mouth moved and dorothy heard a voice say
1045,i am oz the great and terrible
1046,who are you and why do you seek me
1047,it was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big head so she took courage and answered
1048,i am dorothy the small and meek
1049,i have come to you for help
1050,the eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute
1051,then said the voice
1052,where did you get the silver shoes
1053,i got them from the wicked witch of the east when my house fell on her and killed her she replied
1054,where did you get the mark upon your forehead
1055,continued the voice
1056,that is where the good witch of the north kissed me when she bade me good bye and sent me to you said the girl
1057,again the eyes looked at her sharply and they saw she was telling the truth
1058,then oz asked what do you wish me to do
1059,send me back to kansas where my aunt them and uncle henry are she answered earnestly
1060,i do not like your country although it is so beautiful
1061,and i am sure aunt them will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long
1062,the eyes winked three times and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room
1063,and at last they looked at dorothy again
1064,why should i do this for you
1065,asked oz
1066,because you are strong and i am weak because you are a great wizard and i am only a little girl
1067,but you were strong enough to kill the wicked witch of the east said oz
1068,that just happened returned dorothy simply i could not help it
1069,well said the head i will give you my answer
1070,you have no right to expect me to send you back to kansas unless you do something for me in return
1071,in this country everyone must pay for everything he gets
1072,if you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first
1073,help me and i will help you
1074,what must i do
1075,asked the girl
1076,kill the wicked witch of the west answered oz
1077,but i cannot exclaimed dorothy greatly surprised
1078,you killed the witch of the east and you wear the silver shoes which bear a powerful charm
1079,there is now but one wicked witch left in all this land and when you can tell me she is dead i will send you back to kansasbut not before
1080,the little girl began to weep she was so much disappointed and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously as if the great oz felt that she could help him if she would
1081,i never killed anything willingly she sobbed
1082,even if i wanted to how could i kill the wicked witch
1083,if you who are great and terrible cannot kill her yourself how do you expect me to do it
1084,i do not know said the head but that is my answer and until the wicked witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again
1085,remember that the witch is wickedtremendously wickedand ought to be killed
1086,now go and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task
1087,sorrowfully dorothy left the throne room and went back where the lion and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were waiting to hear what oz had said to her
1088,there is no hope for me she said sadly for oz will not send me home until i have killed the wicked witch of the west and that i can never do
1089,her friends were sorry but could do nothing to help her so dorothy went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep
1090,the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the scarecrow and said
1091,come with me for oz has sent for you
1092,so the scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great throne room where he saw sitting in the emerald throne a most lovely lady
1093,she was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels
1094,growing from her shoulders were wings gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them
1095,when the scarecrow had bowed as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him before this beautiful creature she looked upon him sweetly and said
1096,i am oz the great and terrible
1097,who are you and why do you seek me
1098,now the scarecrow who had expected to see the great head dorothy had told him of was much astonished but he answered her bravely
1099,i am only a scarecrow stuffed with straw
1100,therefore i have no brains and i come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw so that i may become as much a man as any other in your dominions
1101,why should i do this for you
1102,asked the lady
1103,because you are wise and powerful and no one else can help me answered the scarecrow
1104,i never grant favors without some return said oz but this much i will promise
1105,if you will kill for me the wicked witch of the west i will bestow upon you a great many brains and such good brains that you will be the wisest man in all the land of oz
1106,i thought you asked dorothy to kill the witch said the scarecrow in surprise
1107,so i did
1108,i do not care who kills her
1109,but until she is dead i will not grant your wish
1110,now go and do not seek me again until you have earned the brains you so greatly desire
1111,the scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what oz had said and dorothy was surprised to find that the great wizard was not a head as she had seen him but a lovely lady
1112,all the same said the scarecrow she needs a heart as much as the tin woodman
1113,on the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the tin woodman and said
1114,oz has sent for you
1115,follow me
1116,so the tin woodman followed him and came to the great throne room
1117,he did not know whether he would find oz a lovely lady or a head but he hoped it would be the lovely lady
1118,for he said to himself if it is the head i am sure i shall not be given a heart since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me
1119,but if it is the lovely lady i shall beg hard for a heart for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted
1120,but when the woodman entered the great throne room he saw neither the head nor the lady for oz had taken the shape of a most terrible beast
1121,it was nearly as big as an elephant and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight
1122,the beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros only there were five eyes in its face
1123,there were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long slim legs
1124,thick woolly hair covered every part of it and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined
1125,it was fortunate the tin woodman had no heart at that moment for it would have beat loud and fast from terror
1126,but being only tin the woodman was not at all afraid although he was much disappointed
1127,i am oz the great and terrible spoke the beast in a voice that was one great roar
1128,who are you and why do you seek me
1129,i am a woodman and made of tin
1130,therefore i have no heart and cannot love
1131,i pray you to give me a heart that i may be as other men are
1132,why should i do this
1133,demanded the beast
1134,because i ask it and you alone can grant my request answered the woodman
1135,oz gave a low growl at this but said gruffly if you indeed desire a heart you must earn it
1136,how
1137,asked the woodman
1138,help dorothy to kill the wicked witch of the west replied the beast
1139,when the witch is dead come to me and i will then give you the biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the land of oz
1140,so the tin woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell them of the terrible beast he had seen
1141,they all wondered greatly at the many forms the great wizard could take upon himself and the lion said
1142,if he is a beast when i go to see him i shall roar my loudest and so frighten him that he will grant all i ask
1143,and if he is the lovely lady i shall pretend to spring upon her and so compel her to do my bidding
1144,and if he is the great head he will be at my mercy for i will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us what we desire
1145,so be of good cheer my friends for all will yet be well
1146,the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the lion to the great throne room and bade him enter the presence of oz
1147,the lion at once passed through the door and glancing around saw to his surprise that before the throne was a ball of fire so fierce and glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it
1148,his first thought was that oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up but when he tried to go nearer the heat was so intense that it singed his whiskers and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door
1149,then a low quiet voice came from the ball of fire and these were the words it spoke
1150,i am oz the great and terrible
1151,who are you and why do you seek me
1152,and the lion answered i am a cowardly lion afraid of everything
1153,i came to you to beg that you give me courage so that in reality i may become the king of beasts as men call me
1154,why should i give you courage
1155,demanded oz
1156,because of all wizards you are the greatest and alone have power to grant my request answered the lion
1157,the ball of fire burned fiercely for a time and the voice said bring me proof that the wicked witch is dead and that moment i will give you courage
1158,but as long as the witch lives you must remain a coward
1159,the lion was angry at this speech but could say nothing in reply and while he stood silently gazing at the ball of fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room
1160,he was glad to find his friends waiting for him and told them of his terrible interview with the wizard
1161,what shall we do now
1162,asked dorothy sadly
1163,there is only one thing we can do returned the lion and that is to go to the land of the winkies seek out the wicked witch and destroy her
1164,but suppose we cannot
1165,said the girl
1166,then i shall never have courage declared the lion
1167,and i shall never have brains added the scarecrow
1168,and i shall never have a heart spoke the tin woodman
1169,and i shall never see aunt them and uncle henry said dorothy beginning to cry
1170,be careful cried the green girl
1171,the tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it
1172,so dorothy dried her eyes and said i suppose we must try it but i am sure i do not want to kill anybody even to see aunt them again
1173,i will go with you but I am too much of a coward to kill the witch said the lion
1174,i will go too declared the scarecrow but i shall not be of much help to you i am such a fool
1175,i have not the heart to harm even a witch remarked the tin woodman but if you go i certainly shall go with you
1176,therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning and the woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled
1177,the scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better
1178,the green girl who was very kind to them filled dorothys basket with good things to eat and fastened a little bell around totos neck with a green ribbon
1179,they went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the palace and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg
1180,the search for the wicked witch
1181,the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the emerald city until they reached the room where the guardian of the gates lived
1182,this officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box and then he politely opened the gate for our friends
1183,which road leads to the wicked witch of the west
1184,asked dorothy
1185,there is no road answered the guardian of the gates
1186,no one ever wishes to go that way
1187,how then are we to find her
1188,inquired the girl
1189,that will be easy replied the man for when she knows you are in the country of the winkies she will find you and make you all her slaves
1190,perhaps not said the scarecrow for we mean to destroy her
1191,oh that is different said the guardian of the gates
1192,no one has ever destroyed her before so i naturally thought she would make slaves of you as she has of the rest
1193,but take care for she is wicked and fierce and may not allow you to destroy her
1194,keep to the west where the sun sets and you cannot fail to find her
1195,they thanked him and bade him good bye and turned toward the west walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups
1196,dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace but now to her surprise she found it was no longer green but pure white
1197,the ribbon around totos neck had also lost its green color and was as white as dorothys dress
1198,the emerald city was soon left far behind
1199,as they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the west and the ground was untilled
1200,in the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces for there were no trees to offer them shade so that before night dorothy and toto and the lion were tired and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep with the woodman and the scarecrow keeping watch
1201,now the wicked witch of the west had but one eye yet that was as powerful as a telescope and could see everywhere
1202,so as she sat in the door of her castle she happened to look around and saw dorothy lying asleep with her friends all about her
1203,they were a long distance off but the wicked witch was angry to find them in her country so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck
1204,at once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves
1205,they had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth
1206,go to those people said the witch and tear them to pieces
1207,are you not going to make them your slaves
1208,asked the leader of the wolves
1209,no she answered one is of tin and one of straw one is a girl and another a lion
1210,none of them is fit to work so you may tear them into small pieces
1211,very well said the wolf and he dashed away at full speed followed by the others
1212,it was lucky the scarecrow and the woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming
1213,this is my fight said the woodman so get behind me and i will meet them as they come
1214,he seized his axe which he had made very sharp and as the leader of the wolves came on the tin woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolfs head from its body so that it immediately died
1215,as soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up and he also fell under the sharp edge of the tin woodmans weapon
1216,there were forty wolves and forty times a wolf was killed so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the woodman
1217,then he put down his axe and sat beside the scarecrow who said it was a good fight friend
1218,they waited until dorothy awoke the next morning
1219,the little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves but the tin woodman told her all
1220,she thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast after which they started again upon their journey
1221,now this same morning the wicked witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off
1222,she saw all her wolves lying dead and the strangers still traveling through her country
1223,this made her angrier than before and she blew her silver whistle twice
1224,straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her enough to darken the sky
1225,and the wicked witch said to the king crow fly at once to the strangers peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces
1226,the wild crows flew in one great flock toward dorothy and her companions
1227,when the little girl saw them coming she was afraid
1228,but the scarecrow said this is my battle so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed
1229,so they all lay upon the ground except the scarecrow and he stood up and stretched out his arms
1230,and when the crows saw him they were frightened as these birds always are by scarecrows and did not dare to come any nearer
1231,but the king crow said
1232,it is only a stuffed man i will peck his eyes out
1233,the king crow flew at the scarecrow who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died
1234,and then another crow flew at him and the scarecrow twisted its neck also
1235,there were forty crows and forty times the scarecrow twisted a neck until at last all were lying dead beside him
1236,then he called to his companions to rise and again they went upon their journey
1237,when the wicked witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap she got into a terrible rage and blew three times upon her silver whistle
1238,forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her
1239,go to the strangers and sting them to death commanded the witch and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where dorothy and her friends were walking
1240,but the woodman had seen them coming and the scarecrow had decided what to do
1241,take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the lion he said to the woodman and the bees cannot sting them
1242,this the woodman did and as dorothy lay close beside the lion and held toto in her arms the straw covered them entirely
1243,the bees came and found no one but the woodman to sting so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin without hurting the woodman at all
1244,and as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees and they lay scattered thick about the woodman like little heaps of fine coal
1245,then dorothy and the lion got up and the girl helped the tin woodman put the straw back into the scarecrow again until he was as good as ever
1246,so they started upon their journey once more
1247,the wicked witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth
1248,and then she called a dozen of her slaves who were the winkies and gave them sharp spears telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them
1249,the winkies were not a brave people but they had to do as they were told
1250,so they marched away until they came near to dorothy
1251,then the lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them and the poor winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could
1252,when they returned to the castle the wicked witch beat them well with a strap and sent them back to their work after which she sat down to think what she should do next
1253,she could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed but she was a powerful witch as well as a wicked one and she soon made up her mind how to act
1254,there was in her cupboard a golden cap with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it
1255,this golden cap had a charm
1256,whoever owned it could call three times upon the winged monkeys who would obey any order they were given
1257,but no person could command these strange creatures more than three times
1258,twice already the wicked witch had used the charm of the cap
1259,once was when she had made the winkies her slaves and set herself to rule over their country
1260,the winged monkeys had helped her do this
1261,the second time was when she had fought against the great oz himself and driven him out of the land of the west
1262,the winged monkeys had also helped her in doing this
1263,only once more could she use this golden cap for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted
1264,but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone and her slaves had been scared away by the cowardly lion she saw there was only one way left to destroy dorothy and her friends
1265,so the wicked witch took the golden cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head
1266,then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly
1267,ep pe pep pe kak ke
1268,next she stood upon her right foot and said
1269,hil lo hol lo hel lo
1270,after this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice
1271,ziz zy zuz zy zik
1272,now the charm began to work
1273,the sky was darkened and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air
1274,there was a rushing of many wings a great chattering and laughing and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the wicked witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders
1275,one much bigger than the others seemed to be their leader
1276,he flew close to the witch and said you have called us for the third and last time
1277,what do you command
1278,go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the lion said the wicked witch
1279,bring that beast to me for i have a mind to harness him like a horse and make him work
1280,your commands shall be obeyed said the leader
1281,then with a great deal of chattering and noise the winged monkeys flew away to the place where dorothy and her friends were walking
1282,some of the monkeys seized the tin woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks
1283,here they dropped the poor woodman who fell a great distance to the rocks where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan
1284,others of the monkeys caught the scarecrow and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head
1285,they made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree
1286,the remaining monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way
1287,then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the witchs castle where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it so that he could not escape
1288,but dorothy they did not harm at all
1289,she stood with toto in her arms watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn
1290,the leader of the winged monkeys flew up to her his long hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly but he saw the mark of the good witchs kiss upon her forehead and stopped short motioning the others not to touch her
1291,we dare not harm this little girl he said to them for she is protected by the power of good and that is greater than the power of evil
1292,all we can do is to carry her to the castle of the wicked witch and leave her there
1293,so carefully and gently they lifted dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle where they set her down upon the front doorstep
1294,then the leader said to the witch
1295,we have obeyed you as far as we were able
1296,the tin woodman and the scarecrow are destroyed and the lion is tied up in your yard
1297,the little girl we dare not harm nor the dog she carries in her arms
1298,your power over our band is now ended and you will never see us again
1299,then all the winged monkeys with much laughing and chattering and noise flew into the air and were soon out of sight
1300,the wicked witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on dorothys forehead for she knew well that neither the winged monkeys nor she herself dare hurt the girl in any way
1301,she looked down at dorothys feet and seeing the silver shoes began to tremble with fear for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them
1302,at first the witch was tempted to run away from dorothy but she happened to look into the childs eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the silver shoes gave her
1303,so the wicked witch laughed to herself and thought i can still make her my slave for she does not know how to use her power
1304,then she said to dorothy harshly and severely
1305,come with me and see that you mind everything i tell you for if you do not i will make an end of you as i did of the tin woodman and the scarecrow
1306,dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen where the witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood
1307,dorothy went to work meekly with her mind made up to work as hard as she could for she was glad the wicked witch had decided not to kill her
1308,with dorothy hard at work the witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the cowardly lion like a horse it would amuse her she was sure to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive
1309,but as she opened the gate the lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the witch was afraid and ran out and shut the gate again
1310,if i cannot harness you said the witch to the lion speaking through the bars of the gate i can starve you
1311,you shall have nothing to eat until you do as i wish
1312,so after that she took no food to the imprisoned lion but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked are you ready to be harnessed like a horse
1313,and the lion would answer no
1314,if you come in this yard i will bite you
1315,the reason the lion did not have to do as the witch wished was that every night while the woman was asleep dorothy carried him food from the cupboard
1316,after he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw and dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft shaggy mane while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape
1317,but they could find no way to get out of the castle for it was constantly guarded by the yellow winkies who were the slaves of the wicked witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them
1318,the girl had to work hard during the day and often the witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand
1319,but in truth she did not dare to strike dorothy because of the mark upon her forehead
1320,the child did not know this and was full of fear for herself and toto
1321,once the witch struck toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return
1322,the witch did not bleed where she was bitten for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before
1323,dorothys life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to kansas and aunt them again
1324,sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours with toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress
1325,toto did not really care whether he was in kansas or the land of oz so long as dorothy was with him but he knew the little girl was unhappy and that made him unhappy too
1326,now the wicked witch had a great longing to have for her own the silver shoes which the girl always wore
1327,her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up and she had used up all the power of the golden cap but if she could only get hold of the silver shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost
1328,she watched dorothy carefully to see if she ever took off her shoes thinking she might steal them
1329,but the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath
1330,the witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in dorothys room at night to take the shoes and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark so she never came near when dorothy was bathing
1331,indeed the old witch never touched water nor ever let water touch her in any way
1332,but the wicked creature was very cunning and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted
1333,she placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes
1334,so that when dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar not being able to see it and fell at full length
1335,she was not much hurt but in her fall one of the silver shoes came off and before she could reach it the witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot
1336,the wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm and dorothy could not use it against her even had she known how to do so
1337,the little girl seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes grew angry and said to the witch give me back my shoe
1338,i will not retorted the witch for it is now my shoe and not yours
1339,you are a wicked creature cried dorothy
1340,you have no right to take my shoe from me
1341,i shall keep it just the same said the witch laughing at her and someday i shall get the other one from you too
1342,this made dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the witch wetting her from head to foot
1343,instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear and then as dorothy looked at her in wonder the witch began to shrink and fall away
1344,see what you have done she screamed
1345,in a minute i shall melt away
1346,I am very sorry indeed said dorothy who was truly frightened to see the witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes
1347,did not you know water would be the end of me
1348,asked the witch in a wailing despairing voice
1349,of course not answered dorothy
1350,how should i
1351,well in a few minutes i shall be all melted and you will have the castle to yourself
1352,i have been wicked in my day but i never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds
1353,look outhere i go
1354,with these words the witch fell down in a brown melted shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor
1355,seeing that she had really melted away to nothing dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess
1356,she then swept it all out the door
1357,after picking out the silver shoe which was all that was left of the old woman she cleaned and dried it with a cloth and put it on her foot again
1358,then being at last free to do as she chose she ran out to the courtyard to tell the lion that the wicked witch of the west had come to an end and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land
1359,the rescue
1360,the cowardly lion was much pleased to hear that the wicked witch had been melted by a bucket of water and dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his prison and set him free
1361,they went in together to the castle where dorothys first act was to call all the winkies together and tell them that they were no longer slaves
1362,there was great rejoicing among the yellow winkies for they had been made to work hard during many years for the wicked witch who had always treated them with great cruelty
1363,they kept this day as a holiday then and ever after and spent the time in feasting and dancing
1364,if our friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman were only with us said the lion i should be quite happy
1365,do not you suppose we could rescue them
1366,asked the girl anxiously
1367,we can try answered the lion
1368,so they called the yellow winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends and the winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for dorothy who had set them free from bondage
1369,so she chose a number of the winkies who looked as if they knew the most and they all started away
1370,they traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the tin woodman lay all battered and bent
1371,his axe was near him but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short
1372,the winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms and carried him back to the yellow castle again dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend and the lion looking sober and sorry
1373,when they reached the castle dorothy said to the winkies
1374,are any of your people tinsmiths
1375,oh yes
1376,some of us are very good tinsmiths they told her
1377,then bring them to me she said
1378,and when the tinsmiths came bringing with them all their tools in baskets she inquired can you straighten out those dents in the tin woodman and bend him back into shape again and solder him together where he is broken
1379,the tinsmiths looked the woodman over carefully and then answered that they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever
1380,so they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the tin woodman until at last he was straightened out into his old form and his joints worked as well as ever
1381,to be sure there were several patches on him but the tinsmiths did a good job and as the woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all
1382,when at last he walked into dorothys room and thanked her for rescuing him he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy and dorothy had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron so his joints would not be rusted
1383,at the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again and these tears did not need to be wiped away
1384,as for the lion he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it dried
1385,if we only had the scarecrow with us again said the tin woodman when dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened i should be quite happy
1386,we must try to find him said the girl
1387,so she called the winkies to help her and they walked all that day and part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the winged monkeys had tossed the scarecrows clothes
1388,it was a very tall tree and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb it but the woodman said at once ill chop it down and then we can get the scarecrows clothes
1389,now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the woodman himself another of the winkies who was a goldsmith had made an axe handle of solid gold and fitted it to the woodmans axe instead of the old broken handle
1390,others polished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like burnished silver
1391,as soon as he had spoken the tin woodman began to chop and in a short time the tree fell over with a crash whereupon the scarecrows clothes fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground
1392,dorothy picked them up and had the winkies carry them back to the castle where they were stuffed with nice clean straw and behold here was the scarecrow as good as ever thanking them over and over again for saving him
1393,now that they were reunited dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at the yellow castle where they found everything they needed to make them comfortable
1394,but one day the girl thought of aunt them and said we must go back to oz and claim his promise
1395,yes said the woodman at last i shall get my heart
1396,and i shall get my brains added the scarecrow joyfully
1397,and i shall get my courage said the lion thoughtfully
1398,and i shall get back to kansas cried dorothy clapping her hands
1399,oh let us start for the emerald city tomorrow
1400,this they decided to do
1401,the next day they called the winkies together and bade them good bye
1402,the winkies were sorry to have them go and they had grown so fond of the tin woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the yellow land of the west
1403,finding they were determined to go the winkies gave toto and the lion each a golden collar and to dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with diamonds and to the scarecrow they gave a gold headed walking stick to keep him from stumbling and to the tin woodman they offered a silver oil can inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels
1404,every one of the travelers made the winkies a pretty speech in return and all shook hands with them until their arms ached
1405,dorothy went to the witchs cupboard to fill her basket with food for the journey and there she saw the golden cap
1406,she tried it on her own head and found that it fitted her exactly
1407,she did not know anything about the charm of the golden cap but she saw that it was pretty so she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket
1408,then being prepared for the journey they all started for the emerald city and the winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them
1409,the winged monkeys
1410,you will remember there was no roadnot even a pathwaybetween the castle of the wicked witch and the emerald city
1411,when the four travelers went in search of the witch she had seen them coming and so sent the winged monkeys to bring them to her
1412,it was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried
1413,they knew of course they must go straight east toward the rising sun and they started off in the right way
1414,but at noon when the sun was over their heads they did not know which was east and which was west and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields
1415,they kept on walking however and at night the moon came out and shone brightly
1416,so they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morningall but the scarecrow and the tin woodman
1417,the next morning the sun was behind a cloud but they started on as if they were quite sure which way they were going
1418,if we walk far enough said dorothy i am sure we shall sometime come to some place
1419,but day by day passed away and they still saw nothing before them but the scarlet fields
1420,the scarecrow began to grumble a bit
1421,we have surely lost our way he said and unless we find it again in time to reach the emerald city i shall never get my brains
1422,nor i my heart declared the tin woodman
1423,it seems to me i can scarcely wait till i get to oz and you must admit this is a very long journey
1424,you see said the cowardly lion with a whimper i have not the courage to keep tramping forever without getting anywhere at all
1425,then dorothy lost heart
1426,she sat down on the grass and looked at her companions and they sat down and looked at her and toto found that for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his head
1427,so he put out his tongue and panted and looked at dorothy as if to ask what they should do next
1428,suppose we call the field mice she suggested
1429,they could probably tell us the way to the emerald city
1430,to be sure they could cried the scarecrow
1431,why did not we think of that before
1432,dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the queen of the mice had given it to her
1433,in a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet and many of the small gray mice came running up to her
1434,among them was the queen herself who asked in her squeaky little voice
1435,what can i do for my friends
1436,we have lost our way said dorothy
1437,can you tell us where the emerald city is
1438,certainly answered the queen but it is a great way off for you have had it at your backs all this time
1439,then she noticed dorothys golden cap and said why do not you use the charm of the cap and call the winged monkeys to you
1440,they will carry you to the city of oz in less than an hour
1441,i did not know there was a charm answered dorothy in surprise
1442,what is it
1443,it is written inside the golden cap replied the queen of the mice
1444,but if you are going to call the winged monkeys we must run away for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us
1445,will not they hurt me
1446,asked the girl anxiously
1447,oh no
1448,they must obey the wearer of the cap
1449,good bye
1450,and she scampered out of sight with all the mice hurrying after her
1451,dorothy looked inside the golden cap and saw some words written upon the lining
1452,these she thought must be the charm so she read the directions carefully and put the cap upon her head
1453,ep pe pep pe kak ke she said standing on her left foot
1454,what did you say
1455,asked the scarecrow who did not know what she was doing
1456,hil lo hol lo hel lo
1457,dorothy went on standing this time on her right foot
1458,hello replied the tin woodman calmly
1459,ziz zy zuz zy zik said dorothy who was now standing on both feet
1460,this ended the saying of the charm and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings as the band of winged monkeys flew up to them
1461,the king bowed low before dorothy and asked what is your command
1462,we wish to go to the emerald city said the child and we have lost our way
1463,we will carry you replied the king and no sooner had he spoken than two of the monkeys caught dorothy in their arms and flew away with her
1464,others took the scarecrow and the woodman and the lion and one little monkey seized toto and flew after them although the dog tried hard to bite him
1465,the scarecrow and the tin woodman were rather frightened at first for they remembered how badly the winged monkeys had treated them before but they saw that no harm was intended so they rode through the air quite cheerfully and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them
1466,dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest monkeys one of them the king himself
1467,they had made a chair of their hands and were careful not to hurt her
1468,why do you have to obey the charm of the golden cap
1469,she asked
1470,that is a long story answered the king with a winged laugh but as we have a long journey before us i will pass the time by telling you about it if you wish
1471,i shall be glad to hear it she replied
1472,once began the leader we were a free people living happily in the great forest flying from tree to tree eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master
1473,perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings chasing birds and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest
1474,but we were careless and happy and full of fun and enjoyed every minute of the day
1475,this was many years ago long before oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land
1476,there lived here then away at the north a beautiful princess who was also a powerful sorceress
1477,all her magic was used to help the people and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good
1478,her name was gayelette and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby
1479,everyone loved her but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise
1480,at last however she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years
1481,gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish
1482,when he grew to manhood quelala as he was called was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land while his manly beauty was so great that gayelette loved him dearly and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding
1483,my grandfather was at that time the king of the winged monkeys which lived in the forest near gayelettes palace and the old fellow loved a joke better than a good dinner
1484,one day just before the wedding my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw quelala walking beside the river
1485,he was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do
1486,at his word the band flew down and seized quelala carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river and then dropped him into the water
1487,swim out my fine fellow cried my grandfather and see if the water has spotted your clothes
1488,quelala was much too wise not to swim and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune
1489,he laughed when he came to the top of the water and swam in to shore
1490,but when gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river
1491,the princess was angry and she knew of course who did it
1492,she had all the winged monkeys brought before her and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated quelala and dropped in the river
1493,but my grandfather pleaded hard for he knew the monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied and quelala said a kind word for them also so that gayelette finally spared them on condition that the winged monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the golden cap
1494,this cap had been made for a wedding present to quelala and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom
1495,of course my grandfather and all the other monkeys at once agreed to the condition and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the golden cap whosoever he may be
1496,and what became of them
1497,asked dorothy who had been greatly interested in the story
1498,quelala being the first owner of the golden cap replied the monkey he was the first to lay his wishes upon us
1499,as his bride could not bear the sight of us he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a winged monkey which we were glad to do for we were all afraid of her
1500,this was all we ever had to do until the golden cap fell into the hands of the wicked witch of the west who made us enslave the winkies and afterward drive oz himself out of the land of the west
1501,now the golden cap is yours and three times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us
1502,as the monkey king finished his story dorothy looked down and saw the green shining walls of the emerald city before them
1503,she wondered at the rapid flight of the monkeys but was glad the journey was over
1504,the strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of the city the king bowed low to dorothy and then flew swiftly away followed by all his band
1505,that was a good ride said the little girl
1506,yes and a quick way out of our troubles replied the lion
1507,how lucky it was you brought away that wonderful cap
1508,the discovery of oz the terrible
1509,the four travelers walked up to the great gate of emerald city and rang the bell
1510,after ringing several times it was opened by the same guardian of the gates they had met before
1511,what are you back again
1512,he asked in surprise
1513,do you not see us
1514,answered the scarecrow
1515,but i thought you had gone to visit the wicked witch of the west
1516,we did visit her said the scarecrow
1517,and she let you go again
1518,asked the man in wonder
1519,she could not help it for she is melted explained the scarecrow
1520,melted
1521,well that is good news indeed said the man
1522,who melted her
1523,it was dorothy said the lion gravely
1524,good gracious exclaimed the man and he bowed very low indeed before her
1525,then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great box on all their eyes just as he had done before
1526,afterward they passed on through the gate into the emerald city
1527,when the people heard from the guardian of the gates that dorothy had melted the wicked witch of the west they all gathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the palace of oz
1528,the soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door but he let them in at once and they were again met by the beautiful green girl who showed each of them to their old rooms at once so they might rest until the great oz was ready to receive them
1529,the soldier had the news carried straight to oz that dorothy and the other travelers had come back again after destroying the wicked witch but oz made no reply
1530,they thought the great wizard would send for them at once but he did not
1531,they had no word from him the next day nor the next nor the next
1532,the waiting was tiresome and wearing and at last they grew vexed that oz should treat them in so poor a fashion after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery
1533,so the scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to oz saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the winged monkeys to help them and find out whether he kept his promises or not
1534,when the wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the throne room at four minutes after nine of the clock the next morning
1535,he had once met the winged monkeys in the land of the west and he did not wish to meet them again
1536,the four travelers passed a sleepless night each thinking of the gift oz had promised to bestow on him
1537,dorothy fell asleep only once and then she dreamed she was in kansas where aunt them was telling her how glad she was to have her little girl at home again
1538,promptly at nine of the clock the next morning the green whiskered soldier came to them and four minutes later they all went into the throne room of the great oz
1539,of course each one of them expected to see the wizard in the shape he had taken before and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at all in the room
1540,they kept close to the door and closer to one another for the stillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had seen oz take
1541,presently they heard a solemn voice that seemed to come from somewhere near the top of the great dome and it said
1542,i am oz the great and terrible
1543,why do you seek me
1544,they looked again in every part of the room and then seeing no one dorothy asked where are you
1545,i am everywhere answered the voice but to the eyes of common mortals i am invisible
1546,i will now seat myself upon my throne that you may converse with me
1547,indeed the voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself so they walked toward it and stood in a row while dorothy said
1548,we have come to claim our promise o oz
1549,what promise
1550,asked oz
1551,you promised to send me back to kansas when the wicked witch was destroyed said the girl
1552,and you promised to give me brains said the scarecrow
1553,and you promised to give me a heart said the tin woodman
1554,and you promised to give me courage said the cowardly lion
1555,is the wicked witch really destroyed
1556,asked the voice and dorothy thought it trembled a little
1557,yes she answered i melted her with a bucket of water
1558,dear me said the voice how sudden
1559,well come to me tomorrow for i must have time to think it over
1560,you have had plenty of time already said the tin woodman angrily
1561,we shall not wait a day longer said the scarecrow
1562,you must keep your promises to us exclaimed dorothy
1563,the lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard so he gave a large loud roar which was so fierce and dreadful that toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner
1564,as it fell with a crash they looked that way and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder
1565,for they saw standing in just the spot the screen had hidden a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face who seemed to be as much surprised as they were
1566,the tin woodman raising his axe rushed toward the little man and cried out who are you
1567,i am oz the great and terrible said the little man in a trembling voice
1568,but do not strike meplease dontand ill do anything you want me to
1569,our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay
1570,i thought oz was a great head said dorothy
1571,and i thought oz was a lovely lady said the scarecrow
1572,and i thought oz was a terrible beast said the tin woodman
1573,and i thought oz was a ball of fire exclaimed the lion
1574,no you are all wrong said the little man meekly
1575,i have been making believe
1576,making believe cried dorothy
1577,are you not a great wizard
1578,hush my dear he said
1579,do not speak so loud or you will be overheardand i should be ruined
1580,I am supposed to be a great wizard
1581,and are not you
1582,she asked
1583,not a bit of it my dear I am just a common man
1584,you are more than that said the scarecrow in a grieved tone you are a humbug
1585,exactly so declared the little man rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him
1586,i am a humbug
1587,but this is terrible said the tin woodman
1588,how shall i ever get my heart
1589,or i my courage
1590,asked the lion
1591,or i my brains
1592,wailed the scarecrow wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve
1593,my dear friends said oz i pray you not to speak of these little things
1594,think of me and the terrible trouble I am in at being found out
1595,does not anyone else know you are a humbug
1596,asked dorothy
1597,no one knows it but you fourand myself replied oz
1598,i have fooled everyone so long that i thought i should never be found out
1599,it was a great mistake my ever letting you into the throne room
1600,usually i will not see even my subjects and so they believe i am something terrible
1601,but i do not understand said dorothy in bewilderment
1602,how was it that you appeared to me as a great head
1603,that was one of my tricks answered oz
1604,step this way please and i will tell you all about it
1605,he led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the throne room and they all followed him
1606,he pointed to one corner in which lay the great head made out of many thicknesses of paper and with a carefully painted face
1607,this i hung from the ceiling by a wire said oz
1608,i stood behind the screen and pulled a thread to make the eyes move and the mouth open
1609,but how about the voice
1610,she inquired
1611,oh i am a ventriloquist said the little man i can throw the sound of my voice wherever i wish so that you thought it was coming out of the head
1612,here are the other things i used to deceive you
1613,he showed the scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely lady
1614,and the tin woodman saw that his terrible beast was nothing but a lot of skins sewn together with slats to keep their sides out
1615,as for the ball of fire the false wizard had hung that also from the ceiling
1616,it was really a ball of cotton but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely
1617,really said the scarecrow you ought to be ashamed of yourself for being such a humbug
1618,i ami certainly am answered the little man sorrowfully but it was the only thing i could do
1619,sit down please there are plenty of chairs and i will tell you my story
1620,so they sat down and listened while he told the following tale
1621,i was born in omaha
1622,why that is not very far from kansas cried dorothy
1623,no but its farther from here he said shaking his head at her sadly
1624,when i grew up i became a ventriloquist and at that i was very well trained by a great master
1625,i can imitate any kind of a bird or beast
1626,here he mewed so like a kitten that toto pricked up his ears and looked everywhere to see where she was
1627,after a time continued oz i tired of that and became a balloonist
1628,what is that
1629,asked dorothy
1630,a man who goes up in a balloon on circus day so as to draw a crowd of people together and get them to pay to see the circus he explained
1631,oh she said i know
1632,well one day i went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted so that i could not come down again
1633,it went way up above the clouds so far that a current of air struck it and carried it many many miles away
1634,for a day and a night i traveled through the air and on the morning of the second day i awoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country
1635,it came down gradually and i was not hurt a bit
1636,but i found myself in the midst of a strange people who seeing me come from the clouds thought i was a great wizard
1637,of course i let them think so because they were afraid of me and promised to do anything i wished them to
1638,just to amuse myself and keep the good people busy i ordered them to build this city and my palace and they did it all willingly and well
1639,then i thought as the country was so green and beautiful i would call it the emerald city and to make the name fit better i put green spectacles on all the people so that everything they saw was green
1640,but is not everything here green
1641,asked dorothy
1642,no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you
1643,the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now
1644,but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy
1645,i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them
1646,one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things
1647,there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west
1648,fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me
1649,as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east
1650,when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises
1651,i think you are a very bad man said dorothy
1652,oh no my dear I am really a very good man but I am a very bad wizard i must admit
1653,cannot you give me brains
1654,asked the scarecrow
1655,you do not need them
1656,you are learning something every day
1657,a baby has brains but it does not know much
1658,experience is the only thing that brings knowledge and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get
1659,that may all be true said the scarecrow but i shall be very unhappy unless you give me brains
1660,the false wizard looked at him carefully
1661,well he said with a sigh I am not much of a magician as i said but if you will come to me tomorrow morning i will stuff your head with brains
1662,i cannot tell you how to use them however you must find that out for yourself
1663,oh thank youthank you cried the scarecrow
1664,ill find a way to use them never fear
1665,but how about my courage
1666,asked the lion anxiously
1667,you have plenty of courage i am sure answered oz
1668,all you need is confidence in yourself
1669,there is no living thing that is not afraid when it faces danger
1670,the true courage is in facing danger when you are afraid and that kind of courage you have in plenty
1671,perhaps i have but I am scared just the same said the lion
1672,i shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid
1673,very well i will give you that sort of courage tomorrow replied oz
1674,how about my heart
1675,asked the tin woodman
1676,why as for that answered oz i think you are wrong to want a heart
1677,it makes most people unhappy
1678,if you only knew it you are in luck not to have a heart
1679,that must be a matter of opinion said the tin woodman
1680,for my part i will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur if you will give me the heart
1681,very well answered oz meekly
1682,come to me tomorrow and you shall have a heart
1683,i have played wizard for so many years that i may as well continue the part a little longer
1684,and now said dorothy how am i to get back to kansas
1685,we shall have to think about that replied the little man
1686,give me two or three days to consider the matter and ill try to find a way to carry you over the desert
1687,in the meantime you shall all be treated as my guests and while you live in the palace my people will wait upon you and obey your slightest wish
1688,there is only one thing i ask in return for my helpsuch as it is
1689,you must keep my secret and tell no one i am a humbug
1690,they agreed to say nothing of what they had learned and went back to their rooms in high spirits
1691,even dorothy had hope that the great and terrible humbug as she called him would find a way to send her back to kansas and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything
1692,the magic art of the great humbug
1693,next morning the scarecrow said to his friends
1694,congratulate me i am going to oz to get my brains at last
1695,when i return i shall be as other men are
1696,i have always liked you as you were said dorothy simply
1697,it is kind of you to like a scarecrow he replied
1698,but surely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain is going to turn out
1699,then he said good bye to them all in a cheerful voice and went to the throne room where he rapped upon the door
1700,come in said oz
1701,the scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window engaged in deep thought
1702,i have come for my brains remarked the scarecrow a little uneasily
1703,oh yes sit down in that chair please replied oz
1704,you must excuse me for taking your head off but i shall have to do it in order to put your brains in their proper place
1705,that is all right said the scarecrow
1706,you are quite welcome to take my head off as long as it will be a better one when you put it on again
1707,so the wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw
1708,then he entered the back room and took up a measure of bran which he mixed with a great many pins and needles
1709,having shaken them together thoroughly he filled the top of the scarecrows head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space with straw to hold it in place
1710,when he had fastened the scarecrows head on his body again he said to him hereafter you will be a great man for i have given you a lot of bran new brains
1711,the scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish and having thanked oz warmly he went back to his friends
1712,dorothy looked at him curiously
1713,his head was quite bulged out at the top with brains
1714,how do you feel
1715,she asked
1716,i feel wise indeed he answered earnestly
1717,when i get used to my brains i shall know everything
1718,why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head
1719,asked the tin woodman
1720,that is proof that he is sharp remarked the lion
1721,well i must go to oz and get my heart said the woodman
1722,so he walked to the throne room and knocked at the door
1723,come in called oz and the woodman entered and said i have come for my heart
1724,very well answered the little man
1725,but i shall have to cut a hole in your breast so i can put your heart in the right place
1726,i hope it will not hurt you
1727,oh no answered the woodman
1728,i shall not feel it at all
1729,so oz brought a pair of tinsmiths shears and cut a small square hole in the left side of the tin woodmans breast
1730,then going to a chest of drawers he took out a pretty heart made entirely of silk and stuffed with sawdust
1731,is not it a beauty
1732,he asked
1733,it is indeed replied the woodman who was greatly pleased
1734,but is it a kind heart
1735,oh very answered oz
1736,he put the heart in the woodmans breast and then replaced the square of tin soldering it neatly together where it had been cut
1737,there said he now you have a heart that any man might be proud of
1738,I am sorry i had to put a patch on your breast but it really could not be helped
1739,never mind the patch exclaimed the happy woodman
1740,i am very grateful to you and shall never forget your kindness
1741,do not speak of it replied oz
1742,then the tin woodman went back to his friends who wished him every joy on account of his good fortune
1743,the lion now walked to the throne room and knocked at the door
1744,come in said oz
1745,i have come for my courage announced the lion entering the room
1746,very well answered the little man i will get it for you
1747,he went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle the contents of which he poured into a green gold dish beautifully carved
1748,placing this before the cowardly lion who sniffed at it as if he did not like it the wizard said
1749,drink
1750,what is it
1751,asked the lion
1752,well answered oz if it were inside of you it would be courage
1753,you know of course that courage is always inside one so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it
1754,therefore i advise you to drink it as soon as possible
1755,the lion hesitated no longer but drank till the dish was empty
1756,how do you feel now
1757,asked oz
1758,full of courage replied the lion who went joyfully back to his friends to tell them of his good fortune
1759,oz left to himself smiled to think of his success in giving the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion exactly what they thought they wanted
1760,how can i help being a humbug he said when all these people make me do things that everybody knows cannot be done
1761,it was easy to make the scarecrow and the lion and the woodman happy because they imagined i could do anything
1762,but it will take more than imagination to carry dorothy back to kansas and I am sure i do not know how it can be done
1763,how the balloon was launched
1764,for three days dorothy heard nothing from oz
1765,these were sad days for the little girl although her friends were all quite happy and contented
1766,the scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself
1767,when the tin woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his breast and he told dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh
1768,the lion declared he was afraid of nothing on earth and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the fierce kalidahs
1769,thus each of the little party was satisfied except dorothy who longed more than ever to get back to kansas
1770,on the fourth day to her great joy oz sent for her and when she entered the throne room he greeted her pleasantly
1771,sit down my dear i think i have found the way to get you out of this country
1772,and back to kansas
1773,she asked eagerly
1774,well I am not sure about kansas said oz for i have not the faintest notion which way it lies
1775,but the first thing to do is to cross the desert and then it should be easy to find your way home
1776,how can i cross the desert
1777,she inquired
1778,well ill tell you what i think said the little man
1779,you see when i came to this country it was in a balloon
1780,you also came through the air being carried by a cyclone
1781,so i believe the best way to get across the desert will be through the air
1782,now it is quite beyond my powers to make a cyclone but I have been thinking the matter over and i believe i can make a balloon
1783,how
1784,asked dorothy
1785,a balloon said oz is made of silk which is coated with glue to keep the gas in it
1786,i have plenty of silk in the palace so it will be no trouble to make the balloon
1787,but in all this country there is no gas to fill the balloon with to make it float
1788,if it will not float remarked dorothy it will be of no use to us
1789,true answered oz
1790,but there is another way to make it float which is to fill it with hot air
1791,hot air is not as good as gas for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert and we should be lost
1792,we exclaimed the girl
1793,are you going with me
1794,yes of course replied oz
1795,i am tired of being such a humbug
1796,if i should go out of this palace my people would soon discover i am not a wizard and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them
1797,so i have to stay shut up in these rooms all day and it gets tiresome
1798,id much rather go back to kansas with you and be in a circus again
1799,i shall be glad to have your company said dorothy
1800,thank you he answered
1801,now if you will help me sew the silk together we will begin to work on our balloon
1802,so dorothy took a needle and thread and as fast as oz cut the strips of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together
1803,first there was a strip of light green silk then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green for oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them
1804,it took three days to sew all the strips together but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long
1805,then oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue to make it airtight after which he announced that the balloon was ready
1806,but we must have a basket to ride in he said
1807,so he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon
1808,when it was all ready oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a visit to a great brother wizard who lived in the clouds
1809,the news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight
1810,oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the palace and the people gazed upon it with much curiosity
1811,the tin woodman had chopped a big pile of wood and now he made a fire of it and oz held the bottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag
1812,gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air until finally the basket just touched the ground
1813,then oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice
1814,i am now going away to make a visit
1815,while i am gone the scarecrow will rule over you
1816,i command you to obey him as you would me
1817,the balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the ground for the air within it was hot and this made it so much lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky
1818,come dorothy cried the wizard
1819,hurry up or the balloon will fly away
1820,i cannot find toto anywhere replied dorothy who did not wish to leave her little dog behind
1821,toto had run into the crowd to bark at a kitten and dorothy at last found him
1822,she picked him up and ran towards the balloon
1823,she was within a few steps of it and oz was holding out his hands to help her into the basket when crack went the ropes and the balloon rose into the air without her
1824,come back she screamed
1825,i want to go too
1826,i cannot come back my dear called oz from the basket
1827,good bye
1828,good bye shouted everyone and all eyes were turned upward to where the wizard was riding in the basket rising every moment farther and farther into the sky
1829,and that was the last any of them ever saw of oz the wonderful wizard though he may have reached omaha safely and be there now for all we know
1830,but the people remembered him lovingly and said to one another
1831,oz was always our friend
1832,when he was here he built for us this beautiful emerald city and now he is gone he has left the wise scarecrow to rule over us
1833,still for many days they grieved over the loss of the wonderful wizard and would not be comforted
1834,away to the south
1835,dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to kansas again but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon
1836,and she also felt sorry at losing oz and so did her companions
1837,the tin woodman came to her and said
1838,truly i should be ungrateful if i failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart
1839,i should like to cry a little because oz is gone if you will kindly wipe away my tears so that i shall not rust
1840,with pleasure she answered and brought a towel at once
1841,then the tin woodman wept for several minutes and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel
1842,when he had finished he thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil can to guard against mishap
1843,the scarecrow was now the ruler of the emerald city and although he was not a wizard the people were proud of him
1844,for they said there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man
1845,and so far as they knew they were quite right
1846,the morning after the balloon had gone up with oz the four travelers met in the throne room and talked matters over
1847,the scarecrow sat in the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him
1848,we are not so unlucky said the new ruler for this palace and the emerald city belong to us and we can do just as we please
1849,when i remember that a short time ago i was up on a pole in a farmers cornfield and that now i am the ruler of this beautiful city i am quite satisfied with my lot
1850,i also said the tin woodman am well pleased with my new heart and really that was the only thing i wished in all the world
1851,for my part i am content in knowing i am as brave as any beast that ever lived if not braver said the lion modestly
1852,if dorothy would only be contented to live in the emerald city continued the scarecrow we might all be happy together
1853,but i do not want to live here cried dorothy
1854,i want to go to kansas and live with aunt them and uncle henry
1855,well then what can be done
1856,inquired the woodman
1857,the scarecrow decided to think and he thought so hard that the pins and needles began to stick out of his brains
1858,finally he said
1859,why not call the winged monkeys and ask them to carry you over the desert
1860,i never thought of that said dorothy joyfully
1861,its just the thing
1862,ill go at once for the golden cap
1863,when she brought it into the throne room she spoke the magic words and soon the band of winged monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside her
1864,this is the second time you have called us said the monkey king bowing before the little girl
1865,what do you wish
1866,i want you to fly with me to kansas said dorothy
1867,but the monkey king shook his head
1868,that cannot be done he said
1869,we belong to this country alone and cannot leave it
1870,there has never been a winged monkey in kansas yet and i suppose there never will be for they do not belong there
1871,we shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power but we cannot cross the desert
1872,good bye
1873,and with another bow the monkey king spread his wings and flew away through the window followed by all his band
1874,dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment
1875,i have wasted the charm of the golden cap to no purpose she said for the winged monkeys cannot help me
1876,it is certainly too bad said the tender hearted woodman
1877,the scarecrow was thinking again and his head bulged out so horribly that dorothy feared it would burst
1878,let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers he said and ask his advice
1879,so the soldier was summoned and entered the throne room timidly for while oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door
1880,this little girl said the scarecrow to the soldier wishes to cross the desert
1881,how can she do so
1882,i cannot tell answered the soldier for nobody has ever crossed the desert unless it is oz himself
1883,is there no one who can help me
1884,asked dorothy earnestly
1885,glinda might he suggested
1886,who is glinda
1887,inquired the scarecrow
1888,the witch of the south
1889,she is the most powerful of all the witches and rules over the quadlings
1890,besides her castle stands on the edge of the desert so she may know a way to cross it
1891,glinda is a good witch is not she
1892,asked the child
1893,the quadlings think she is good said the soldier and she is kind to everyone
1894,i have heard that glinda is a beautiful woman who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived
1895,how can i get to her castle
1896,asked dorothy
1897,the road is straight to the south he answered but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers
1898,there are wild beasts in the woods and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country
1899,for this reason none of the quadlings ever come to the emerald city
1900,the soldier then left them and the scarecrow said
1901,it seems in spite of dangers that the best thing dorothy can do is to travel to the land of the south and ask glinda to help her
1902,for of course if dorothy stays here she will never get back to kansas
1903,you must have been thinking again remarked the tin woodman
1904,i have said the scarecrow
1905,i shall go with dorothy declared the lion for i am tired of your city and long for the woods and the country again
1906,i am really a wild beast you know
1907,besides dorothy will need someone to protect her
1908,that is true agreed the woodman
1909,my axe may be of service to her so i also will go with her to the land of the south
1910,when shall we start
1911,asked the scarecrow
1912,are you going
1913,they asked in surprise
1914,certainly
1915,if it was not for dorothy i should never have had brains
1916,she lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the emerald city
1917,so my good luck is all due to her and i shall never leave her until she starts back to kansas for good and all
1918,thank you said dorothy gratefully
1919,you are all very kind to me
1920,but i should like to start as soon as possible
1921,we shall go tomorrow morning returned the scarecrow
1922,so now let us all get ready for it will be a long journey
1923,attacked by the fighting trees
1924,the next morning dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good bye and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers who had walked with them as far as the gate
1925,when the guardian of the gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful city to get into new trouble
1926,but he at once unlocked their spectacles which he put back into the green box and gave them many good wishes to carry with them
1927,you are now our ruler he said to the scarecrow so you must come back to us as soon as possible
1928,i certainly shall if i am able the scarecrow replied but i must help dorothy to get home first
1929,as dorothy bade the good natured guardian a last farewell she said
1930,i have been very kindly treated in your lovely city and everyone has been good to me i cannot tell you how grateful i am
1931,do not try my dear he answered
1932,we should like to keep you with us but if it is your wish to return to kansas i hope you will find a way
1933,he then opened the gate of the outer wall and they walked forth and started upon their journey
1934,the sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the land of the south
1935,they were all in the best of spirits and laughed and chatted together
1936,dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home and the scarecrow and the tin woodman were glad to be of use to her
1937,as for the lion he sniffed the fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country again while toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies barking merrily all the time
1938,city life does not agree with me at all remarked the lion as they walked along at a brisk pace
1939,i have lost much flesh since i lived there and now i am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how courageous i have grown
1940,they now turned and took a last look at the emerald city
1941,all they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls and high up above everything the spires and dome of the palace of oz
1942,oz was not such a bad wizard after all said the tin woodman as he felt his heart rattling around in his breast
1943,he knew how to give me brains and very good brains too said the scarecrow
1944,if oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me added the lion he would have been a brave man
1945,dorothy said nothing
1946,oz had not kept the promise he made her but he had done his best so she forgave him
1947,as he said he was a good man even if he was a bad wizard
1948,the first days journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the emerald city on every side
1949,they slept that night on the grass with nothing but the stars over them and they rested very well indeed
1950,in the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood
1951,there was no way of going around it for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as they could see and besides they did not dare change the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost
1952,so they looked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest
1953,the scarecrow who was in the lead finally discovered a big tree with such wide spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath
1954,so he walked forward to the tree but just as he came under the first branches they bent down and twined around him and the next minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers
1955,this did not hurt the scarecrow but it surprised him and he looked rather dizzy when dorothy picked him up
1956,here is another space between the trees called the lion
1957,let me try it first said the scarecrow for it does not hurt me to get thrown about
1958,he walked up to another tree as he spoke but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again
1959,this is strange exclaimed dorothy
1960,what shall we do
1961,the trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us and stop our journey remarked the lion
1962,i believe i will try it myself said the woodman and shouldering his axe he marched up to the first tree that had handled the scarecrow so roughly
1963,when a big branch bent down to seize him the woodman chopped at it so fiercely that he cut it in two
1964,at once the tree began shaking all its branches as if in pain and the tin woodman passed safely under it
1965,come on he shouted to the others
1966,be quick
1967,they all ran forward and passed under the tree without injury except toto who was caught by a small branch and shaken until he howled
1968,but the woodman promptly chopped off the branch and set the little dog free
1969,the other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back so they made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches and that probably these were the policemen of the forest and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it
1970,the four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the farther edge of the wood
1971,then to their surprise they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china
1972,it was smooth like the surface of a dish and higher than their heads
1973,what shall we do now
1974,asked dorothy
1975,i will make a ladder said the tin woodman for we certainly must climb over the wall
1976,the dainty china country
1977,while the woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest dorothy lay down and slept for she was tired by the long walk
1978,the lion also curled himself up to sleep and toto lay beside him
1979,the scarecrow watched the woodman while he worked and said to him
1980,i cannot think why this wall is here nor what it is made of
1981,rest your brains and do not worry about the wall replied the woodman
1982,when we have climbed over it we shall know what is on the other side
1983,after a time the ladder was finished
1984,it looked clumsy but the tin woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose
1985,the scarecrow waked dorothy and the lion and toto and told them that the ladder was ready
1986,the scarecrow climbed up the ladder first but he was so awkward that dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off
1987,when he got his head over the top of the wall the scarecrow said oh my
1988,go on exclaimed dorothy
1989,so the scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall and dorothy put her head over and cried oh my just as the scarecrow had done
1990,then toto came up and immediately began to bark but dorothy made him be still
1991,the lion climbed the ladder next and the tin woodman came last but both of them cried oh my as soon as they looked over the wall
1992,when they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall they looked down and saw a strange sight
1993,before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter
1994,scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors
1995,these houses were quite small the biggest of them reaching only as high as dorothys waist
1996,there were also pretty little barns with china fences around them and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens all made of china were standing about in groups
1997,but the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country
1998,there were milkmaids and shepherdesses with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them and golden buckles on their shoes and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads wearing ermine robes and satin doublets and funny clowns in ruffled gowns with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall pointed caps
1999,and strangest of all these people were all made of china even to their clothes and were so small that the tallest of them was no higher than dorothys knee
2000,no one did so much as look at the travelers at first except one little purple china dog with an extra large head which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice afterwards running away again
2001,how shall we get down
2002,asked dorothy
2003,they found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up so the scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet
2004,of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet
2005,when all were safely down they picked up the scarecrow whose body was quite flattened out and patted his straw into shape again
2006,we must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side said dorothy for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except due south
2007,they began walking through the country of the china people and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow
2008,as they drew near the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool the pail and even the milkmaid herself and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter
2009,dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off and that the pail was lying in several small pieces while the poor milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow
2010,there cried the milkmaid angrily
2011,see what you have done
2012,my cow has broken her leg and i must take her to the menders shop and have it glued on again
2013,what do you mean by coming here and frightening my cow
2014,I am very sorry returned dorothy
2015,please forgive us
2016,but the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer
2017,she picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away the poor animal limping on three legs
2018,as she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers holding her nicked elbow close to her side
2019,dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap
2020,we must be very careful here said the kind hearted woodman or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it
2021,a little farther on dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young princess who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away
2022,dorothy wanted to see more of the princess so she ran after her
2023,but the china girl cried out
2024,do not chase me
2025,do not chase me
2026,she had such a frightened little voice that dorothy stopped and said why not
2027,because answered the princess also stopping a safe distance away if i run i may fall down and break myself
2028,but could you not be mended
2029,asked the girl
2030,oh yes but one is never so pretty after being mended you know replied the princess
2031,i suppose not said dorothy
2032,now there is mr joker one of our clowns continued the china lady who is always trying to stand upon his head
2033,he has broken himself so often that he is mended in a hundred places and does not look at all pretty
2034,here he comes now so you can see for yourself
2035,indeed a jolly little clown came walking toward them and dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places
2036,the clown put his hands in his pockets and after puffing out his cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily he said
2037,my lady fair why do you stare at poor old mr joker
2038,you are quite as stiff and prim as if you would eaten up a poker
2039,be quiet sir said the princess
2040,cannot you see these are strangers and should be treated with respect
2041,well that is respect i expect declared the clown and immediately stood upon his head
2042,do not mind mr joker said the princess to dorothy
2043,he is considerably cracked in his head and that makes him foolish
2044,oh i do not mind him a bit said dorothy
2045,but you are so beautiful she continued that i am sure i could love you dearly
2046,will not you let me carry you back to kansas and stand you on aunt ems mantel
2047,i could carry you in my basket
2048,that would make me very unhappy answered the china princess
2049,you see here in our country we live contentedly and can talk and move around as we please
2050,but whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once stiffen and we can only stand straight and look pretty
2051,of course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing room tables but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country
2052,i would not make you unhappy for all the world exclaimed dorothy
2053,so ill just say good bye
2054,good bye replied the princess
2055,they walked carefully through the china country
2056,the little animals and all the people scampered out of their way fearing the strangers would break them and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and came to another china wall
2057,it was not so high as the first however and by standing upon the lions back they all managed to scramble to the top
2058,then the lion gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall but just as he jumped he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to pieces
2059,that was too bad said dorothy but really i think we were lucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cows leg and a church
2060,they are all so brittle
2061,they are indeed said the scarecrow and i am thankful i am made of straw and cannot be easily damaged
2062,there are worse things in the world than being a scarecrow
2063,the lion becomes the king of beasts
2064,after climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall rank grass
2065,it was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight
2066,however by carefully picking their way they got safely along until they reached solid ground
2067,but here the country seemed wilder than ever and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen
2068,this forest is perfectly delightful declared the lion looking around him with joy
2069,never have i seen a more beautiful place
2070,it seems gloomy said the scarecrow
2071,not a bit of it answered the lion
2072,i should like to live here all my life
2073,see how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees
2074,surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home
2075,perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now said dorothy
2076,i suppose there are returned the lion but i do not see any of them about
2077,they walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther
2078,dorothy and toto and the lion lay down to sleep while the woodman and the scarecrow kept watch over them as usual
2079,when morning came they started again
2080,before they had gone far they heard a low rumble as of the growling of many wild animals
2081,toto whimpered a little but none of the others was frightened and they kept along the well trodden path until they came to an opening in the wood in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety
2082,there were tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history and for a moment dorothy was afraid
2083,but the lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble
2084,as he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him and at once the great assemblage hushed as if by magic
2085,the biggest of the tigers came up to the lion and bowed saying
2086,welcome o king of beasts
2087,you have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more
2088,what is your trouble
2089,asked the lion quietly
2090,we are all threatened answered the tiger by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest
2091,it is a most tremendous monster like a great spider with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk
2092,it has eight of these long legs and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth where he eats it as a spider does a fly
2093,not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us
2094,the lion thought for a moment
2095,are there any other lions in this forest
2096,he asked
2097,no there were some but the monster has eaten them all
2098,and besides they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you
2099,if i put an end to your enemy will you bow down to me and obey me as king of the forest
2100,inquired the lion
2101,we will do that gladly returned the tiger and all the other beasts roared with a mighty roar we will
2102,where is this great spider of yours now
2103,asked the lion
2104,yonder among the oak trees said the tiger pointing with his forefoot
2105,take good care of these friends of mine said the lion and i will go at once to fight the monster
2106,he bade his comrades good bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the enemy
2107,the great spider was lying asleep when the lion found him and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust
2108,its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said and its body covered with coarse black hair
2109,it had a great mouth with a row of sharp teeth a foot long but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasps waist
2110,this gave the lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monsters back
2111,then with one blow of his heavy paw all armed with sharp claws he knocked the spiders head from its body
2112,jumping down he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling when he knew it was quite dead
2113,the lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting for him and said proudly
2114,you need fear your enemy no longer
2115,then the beasts bowed down to the lion as their king and he promised to come back and rule over them as soon as dorothy was safely on her way to kansas
2116,the country of the quadlings
2117,the four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety and when they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill covered from top to bottom with great pieces of rock
2118,that will be a hard climb said the scarecrow but we must get over the hill nevertheless
2119,so he led the way and the others followed
2120,they had nearly reached the first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out keep back
2121,who are you
2122,asked the scarecrow
2123,then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said this hill belongs to us and we do not allow anyone to cross it
2124,but we must cross it said the scarecrow
2125,were going to the country of the quadlings
2126,but you shall not replied the voice and there stepped from behind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen
2127,he was quite short and stout and had a big head which was flat at the top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles
2128,but he had no arms at all and seeing this the scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could prevent them from climbing the hill
2129,so he said I am sorry not to do as you wish but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or not and he walked boldly forward
2130,as quick as lightning the mans head shot forward and his neck stretched out until the top of the head where it was flat struck the scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling over and over down the hill
2131,almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body and the man laughed harshly as he said it is not as easy as you think
2132,a chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks and dorothy saw hundreds of the armless hammer heads upon the hillside one behind every rock
2133,the lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the scarecrows mishap and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder he dashed up the hill
2134,again a head shot swiftly out and the great lion went rolling down the hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball
2135,dorothy ran down and helped the scarecrow to his feet and the lion came up to her feeling rather bruised and sore and said it is useless to fight people with shooting heads no one can withstand them
2136,what can we do then
2137,she asked
2138,call the winged monkeys suggested the tin woodman
2139,you have still the right to command them once more
2140,very well she answered and putting on the golden cap she uttered the magic words
2141,the monkeys were as prompt as ever and in a few moments the entire band stood before her
2142,what are your commands
2143,inquired the king of the monkeys bowing low
2144,carry us over the hill to the country of the quadlings answered the girl
2145,it shall be done said the king and at once the winged monkeys caught the four travelers and toto up in their arms and flew away with them
2146,as they passed over the hill the hammer heads yelled with vexation and shot their heads high in the air but they could not reach the winged monkeys which carried dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the quadlings
2147,this is the last time you can summon us said the leader to dorothy so good bye and good luck to you
2148,good bye and thank you very much returned the girl and the monkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling
2149,the country of the quadlings seemed rich and happy
2150,there was field upon field of ripening grain with well paved roads running between and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them
2151,the fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the winkies and blue in the country of the munchkins
2152,the quadlings themselves who were short and fat and looked chubby and good natured were dressed all in red which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain
2153,the monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse and the four travelers walked up to it and knocked at the door
2154,it was opened by the farmers wife and when dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies and a bowl of milk for toto
2155,how far is it to the castle of glinda
2156,asked the child
2157,it is not a great way answered the farmers wife
2158,take the road to the south and you will soon reach it
2159,thanking the good woman they started afresh and walked by the fields and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful castle
2160,before the gates were three young girls dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid and as dorothy approached one of them said to her
2161,why have you come to the south country
2162,to see the good witch who rules here she answered
2163,will you take me to her
2164,let me have your name and i will ask glinda if she will receive you
2165,they told who they were and the girl soldier went into the castle
2166,after a few moments she came back to say that dorothy and the others were to be admitted at once
2167,glinda the good witch grants dorothys wish
2168,before they went to see glinda however they were taken to a room of the castle where dorothy washed her face and combed her hair and the lion shook the dust out of his mane and the scarecrow patted himself into his best shape and the woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints
2169,when they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big room where the witch glinda sat upon a throne of rubies
2170,she was both beautiful and young to their eyes
2171,her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders
2172,her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue and they looked kindly upon the little girl
2173,what can i do for you my child
2174,she asked
2175,dorothy told the witch all her story how the cyclone had brought her to the land of oz how she had found her companions and of the wonderful adventures they had met with
2176,my greatest wish now she added is to get back to kansas for aunt them will surely think something dreadful has happened to me and that will make her put on mourning and unless the crops are better this year than they were last i am sure uncle henry cannot afford it
2177,glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet upturned face of the loving little girl
2178,bless your dear heart she said i am sure i can tell you of a way to get back to kansas
2179,then she added but if i do you must give me the golden cap
2180,willingly exclaimed dorothy indeed it is of no use to me now and when you have it you can command the winged monkeys three times
2181,and i think i shall need their service just those three times answered glinda smiling
2182,dorothy then gave her the golden cap and the witch said to the scarecrow what will you do when dorothy has left us
2183,i will return to the emerald city he replied for oz has made me its ruler and the people like me
2184,the only thing that worries me is how to cross the hill of the hammer heads
2185,by means of the golden cap i shall command the winged monkeys to carry you to the gates of the emerald city said glinda for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler
2186,am i really wonderful
2187,asked the scarecrow
2188,you are unusual replied glinda
2189,turning to the tin woodman she asked what will become of you when dorothy leaves this country
2190,he leaned on his axe and thought a moment
2191,then he said the winkies were very kind to me and wanted me to rule over them after the wicked witch died
2192,i am fond of the winkies and if i could get back again to the country of the west i should like nothing better than to rule over them forever
2193,my second command to the winged monkeys said glinda will be that they carry you safely to the land of the winkies
2194,your brain may not be so large to look at as those of the scarecrow but you are really brighter than he iswhen you are well polishedand i am sure you will rule the winkies wisely and well
2195,then the witch looked at the big shaggy lion and asked when dorothy has returned to her own home what will become of you
2196,over the hill of the hammer heads he answered lies a grand old forest and all the beasts that live there have made me their king
2197,if i could only get back to this forest i would pass my life very happily there
2198,my third command to the winged monkeys said glinda shall be to carry you to your forest
2199,then having used up the powers of the golden cap i shall give it to the king of the monkeys that he and his band may thereafter be free for evermore
2200,the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the lion now thanked the good witch earnestly for her kindness and dorothy exclaimed
2201,you are certainly as good as you are beautiful
2202,but you have not yet told me how to get back to kansas
2203,your silver shoes will carry you over the desert replied glinda
2204,if you had known their power you could have gone back to your aunt them the very first day you came to this country
2205,but then i should not have had my wonderful brains cried the scarecrow
2206,i might have passed my whole life in the farmers cornfield
2207,and i should not have had my lovely heart said the tin woodman
2208,i might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world
2209,and i should have lived a coward forever declared the lion and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me
2210,this is all true said dorothy and i am glad i was of use to these good friends
2211,but now that each of them has had what he most desired and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides i think i should like to go back to kansas
2212,the silver shoes said the good witch have wonderful powers
2213,and one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to any place in the world in three steps and each step will be made in the wink of an eye
2214,all you have to do is to knock the heels together three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go
2215,if that is so said the child joyfully i will ask them to carry me back to kansas at once
2216,she threw her arms around the lions neck and kissed him patting his big head tenderly
2217,then she kissed the tin woodman who was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints
2218,but she hugged the soft stuffed body of the scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades
2219,glinda the good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a good bye kiss and dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to her friends and herself
2220,dorothy now took toto up solemnly in her arms and having said one last good bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times saying
2221,take me home to aunt them
2222,instantly she was whirling through the air so swiftly that all she could see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears
2223,the silver shoes took but three steps and then she stopped so suddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was
2224,at length however she sat up and looked about her
2225,good gracious she cried
2226,for she was sitting on the broad kansas prairie and just before her was the new farmhouse uncle henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one
2227,uncle henry was milking the cows in the barnyard and toto had jumped out of her arms and was running toward the barn barking furiously
2228,dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking feet
2229,for the silver shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air and were lost forever in the desert
2230,home again
2231,aunt them had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up and saw dorothy running toward her
2232,my darling child she cried folding the little girl in her arms and covering her face with kisses
2233,where in the world did you come from
2234,from the land of oz said dorothy gravely
2235,and here is toto too
2236,and oh aunt them
2237,I am so glad to be at home again
