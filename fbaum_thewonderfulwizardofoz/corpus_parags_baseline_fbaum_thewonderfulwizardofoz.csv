could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and
had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I
was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for
she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin
girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right
leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of
tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;
but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked

his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but

492,492,10,"She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led
to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant
part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the
Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood
stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It
would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he
remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web
in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most
wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from
force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not
being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down
to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have
preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being

dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the

great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and
doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some
of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull

nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and

was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the

was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great

she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much
too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,
however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his
years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she
would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used
all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any
woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,
was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly

Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man

people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them
think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful
place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing
that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and
they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself
up and would not see any of them.",no more than in any other city replied oz but when you wear green spectacles why of course everything you see looks green to you the emerald city was built a great many years ago for i was a young man when the balloon brought me here and i am a very old man now but my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an emerald city and it certainly is a beautiful place abounding in jewels and precious metals and every good thing that is needed to make one happy i have been good to the people and they like me but ever since this palace was built i have shut myself up and would not see any of them,658,132,5.4,3.2041086384984716,4.15686274509804,3.2041086384984716,0.709269952033856,5.4,3.264647107452497,4.0,3.264647107452497,0.8343250861259003,101.99221525653721,2.5662397017415675,2.306755330056162,2.5662397017415675,0.7489365786494114,0.6583333333333337,0.5820336951921107,0.6742596810933944,0.5820336951921107,0.10848627232067787,4.091000000000001,1.448545648618685,1.5479249011857708,1.448545648618685,-0.1082740771813433,47.034154162709726,2.8354481549284016,5.786416838637366,2.8354481549284016,0.8980280541915848,3.21104475926971,2.987020271067722,3.136986876981998,2.987020271067722,0.8625854538685009,"{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.25, 'compound': 0.9904}",0.9904,1.7369000572581115,1.301188990343559,1.7369000572581115,0.3108129713334364,0.2797058823529412,0.6771678417399141,1.305294117647059,0.6771678417399141,0.35855596599458023,1.2036632194529133,4.70397278459164,5.6602197958206855,4.70397278459164,1.5908945585639538,-0.9748,-1.0734352413253028,-0.759811937857727,-1.0734352413253028,-0.2179270580549701,28.096641643609964,3.1323456834748136,2.8748197128164823,3.1323456834748136,-0.7125237503556796

powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do
wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they
ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.
Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew
they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were
terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they
themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in
deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I
was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.
When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would
only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I
am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.",one of my greatest fears was the witches for while i had no magical powers at all i soon found out that the witches were really able to do wonderful things there were four of them in this country and they ruled the people who live in the north and south and east and west fortunately the witches of the north and south were good and i knew they would do me no harm but the witches of the east and west were terribly wicked and had they not thought i was more powerful than they themselves they would surely have destroyed me as it was i lived in deadly fear of them for many years so you can imagine how pleased i was when i heard your house had fallen on the wicked witch of the east when you came to me i was willing to promise anything if you would only do away with the other witch but now that you have melted her i am ashamed to say that i cannot keep my promises,887,177,-0.3999999999999998,-0.49908666644598376,-0.39215686274509787,-0.49908666644598376,-0.11685073135788554,-0.3999999999999998,-0.4655140194034757,-0.2962962962962961,-0.4655140194034757,-0.046089521393018945,16.19131729799017,0.30468676115992754,0.3661986101961389,0.30468676115992754,0.08866676553616915,-2.15625,-2.1466252979227396,-2.4031890660592268,-2.1466252979227396,-0.36358714480680937,8.239,3.590420581675371,3.597332015810276,3.590420581675371,0.10825709742816111,-13.178573190453136,-1.129080697685733,-1.6213051807979977,-1.129080697685733,-0.18764872744383077,-0.7581285980768986,-0.9383381635737006,-0.7406435106101962,-0.9383381635737006,-0.15187955468176845,"{'neg': 0.218, 'neu': 0.681, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': -0.9777}",-0.9777,-2.1230101630875353,-1.284503711489194,-2.1230101630875353,-0.22882042268829633,0.27713903743315504,0.6676129067317552,1.2933155080213903,0.6676129067317552,0.26494377640191935,1.0916313504804969,4.226240025840327,5.131335524665826,4.226240025840327,1.0631116641875966,-0.918,-1.0115893932347257,-0.7307849550286183,-1.0115893932347257,-0.18795213045262243,34.49485121249889,4.201292190194549,3.780485260050765,4.201292190194549,-0.8513659464925749

1048,1048,20,"The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it
looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs
were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with
coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a
foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as
slender as a wasps waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to
attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep
than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the
monsters back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with
