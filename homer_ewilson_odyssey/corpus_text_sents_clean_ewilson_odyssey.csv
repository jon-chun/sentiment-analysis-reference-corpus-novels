0,the boy and the goddess tell me about a complicated man  muse  tell me how he wandered and was lost when he had wrecked the holy town of troy  and where he went  and who he met  the pain he suffered in the storms at sea  and how he worked to save his life and bring his men back home 
1,he failed to keep them safe  poor fools  they ate the sun god s cattle  and the god kept them from home 
2,now goddess  child of zeus  tell the old story for our modern times 
3,find the beginning 
4,all the other greeks who had survived the brutal sack of troy sailed safely home to their own wives except this man alone 
5,calypso  a great goddess  had trapped him in her cave  she wanted him to be her husband 
6,when the year rolled round in which the gods decreed he should go home to ithaca  his troubles still went on 
7,the man was friendless 
8,all the gods took pity  except poseidon s anger never ended
9,until odysseus was back at home 
10,but now the distant ethiopians  who live between the sunset and the dawn  were worshipping the sea god with a feast  a hundred cattle and a hundred rams 
11,there sat the god  delighting in his banquet 
12,the other gods were gathered on olympus  in father zeus palace 
13,he was thinking of fine  well born aegisthus  who was killed by agamemnon s famous son orestes 
14,he told the deathless gods  this is absurd  that mortals blame the gods  they say we because their suffering  but they themselves increase it by folly 
15,so aegisthus overstepped  he took the legal wife of agamemnon  then killed the husband when he came back home  although he knew that it would doom them all 
16,we gods had warned aegisthus  we sent down perceptive hermes  who flashed into sight and told him not to murder agamemnon
17,or court his wife  orestes would grow up and come back to his home to take revenge 
18,aegisthus would not hear that good advice 
19,but now his death has paid all debts 
20,athena looked at him steadily and answered  father  he did deserve to die 
21,bring death to all who act like him  but i am agonizing about odysseus and his bad luck 
22,for too long he has suffered  with no friends  sea all around him  sea on every side 
23,out on an island where a goddess lives  daughter of fearful atlas  who holds up the pillars of the sea  and knows its depths those pillars keep the heaven and earth apart 
24,his daughter holds that poor unhappy man  and tries beguiling him with gentle words to cease all thoughts of ithaca  but he longs to see even just the smoke that rises from his own homeland  and he wants to die 
25,you do not even care  olympian 
26,remember how he sacrificed to you on the broad plain of troy beside his ships 
27,so why do you dismiss odysseus 
28,daughter  the cloud god said  you must be joking  since how could i forget odysseus 
29,he is more sensible than other humans  and makes more sacrifices to the gods 
30,but lord poseidon rages  unrelenting  because odysseus destroyed the eye of godlike polyphemus  his own son 
31,the strongest of the cyclopes whose mother  tho sa  is a sea nymph  child of phorcys  the sea king  and she lay beside poseidon inside a hollow cave 
32,so now poseidon prevents odysseus from reaching home but does not kill him 
33,come then  we must plan  how can he get back home 
34,poseidon must give up his anger  since he cannot fight alone against the will of all the gods 
35,athena s eyes lit up and she replied 
36,great father  if the blessed gods at last will let odysseus return back home  then hurry  we must send our messenger  hermes the giant slayer 
37,he must swoop down to ogygia right away and tell the beautiful calypso we have formed a firm decision that odysseus has waited long enough 
38,he must go home 
39,and i will go to ithaca to rouse the courage of his son  and make him call
40,a meeting  and speak out against the suitors who kill his flocks of sheep and longhorn cattle unstoppably 
41,then i will send him off to pylos and to sparta  to seek news about his father s journey home  and gain a noble reputation for himself 
42,with that  she tied her sandals on her feet  the marvelous golden sandals that she wears to travel sea and land  as fast as wind 
43,she took the heavy bronze tipped spear she uses
44,to tame the ranks of warriors with whom she is enraged 
45,then from the mountain down she sped to ithaca  and stopped outside odysseus court  bronze spear in hand 
46,she looked like mentes now  the taphian leader  a guest friend 
47,there she found the lordly suitors sitting on hides they killed the cows themselves and playing checkers 
48,quick  attentive house slaves were waiting on them 
49,some were mixing wine with water in the bowls  and others brought
50,the tables out and wiped them off with sponges  and others carved up heaping plates of meat 
51,telemachus was sitting with them  feeling dejected 
52,in his mind he saw his father coming from somewhere  scattering the suitors  and gaining back his honor  and control of all his property 
53,with this in mind  he was the first to see athena there 
54,he disapproved of leaving strangers stranded  so he went straight to meet her at the gate 
55,and shook her hand  and took her spear of bronze  and let his words fly out to her 
56,good evening  stranger  and welcome 
57,be our guest  come share our dinner  and then tell us what you need 
58,he led her in  and pallas followed him 
59,inside the high roofed hall  he set her spear beside a pillar in a polished stand  in which odysseus kept stores of weapons 
60,and then he led her to a chair and spread a smooth embroidered cloth across the seat 
61,and pulled a footstool up to it 
62,he sat beside her on a chair of inlaid wood  a distance from the suitors  so their shouting would not upset the stranger during dinner  also to ask about his absent father 
63,a girl brought washing water in a jug of gold  and poured it on their hands and into a silver bowl  and set a table by them 
64,a deferential slave brought bread and laid a wide array of food  a generous spread 
65,the carver set beside them plates of meat of every kind  and gave them golden cups 
66,the cup boy kept on topping up the wine 
67,the suitors sauntered in and sat on chairs  observing proper order  and the slaves poured water on their hands 
68,the house girls brought baskets of bread and heaped it up beside them  and house boys filled their wine bowls up with drink 
69,they reached to take the good things set before them 
70,once they were satisfied with food and drink 
71,the suitors turned their minds to other things singing and dancing  glories of the feast 
72,a slave brought out a well tuned lyre and gave it to phemius  the man the suitors forced to sing for them 
73,he struck the chords to start his lovely song 
74,telemachus leaned in close to athena  so they would not hear  and said  dear guest excuse my saying this these men are only interested in music a life of ease 
75,they make no contribution 
76,this food belongs to someone else  a man whose white bones may be lying in the rain or sunk beneath the waves 
77,if they saw him return to ithaca  they would all pray for faster feet  instead of wealth and gold and fancy clothes 
78,in fact  he must have died 
79,we have no hope 
80,he will not come back home 
81,if someone says so  we do not believe it 
82,but come now  tell me this and tell the truth 
83,who are you 
84,from what city  and what parents 
85,what kind of ship did you here arrive on 
86,what sailors brought you here  and by what route 
87,you surely did not travel here on foot  here is the thing i really want to know  have you been here before 
88,are you a friend who visited my father 
89,many men came to his house 
90,he traveled many places 
91,athena s clear bright eyes met his 
92,she said  yes  i will tell you everything 
93,i am mentes  the son of wise anchialus 
94,lord of the taphians  who love the oar 
95,i traveled with my ship and my companions over the wine dark sea to foreign lands  with iron that i hope to trade for copper in temese 
96,my ship is in the harbor far from the town  beneath the woody hill 
97,and you and i are guest friends through our fathers  from long ago laertes can confirm it 
98,i hear that fine old man no longer comes to town  but lives out in the countryside 
99,stricken by grief  with only one old slave  who gives him food and drink when he trails back leg weary from his orchard  rich in vines 
100,i came because they told me that your father was here but now it seems that gods have blocked his path back home 
101,but i am sure that he is not yet dead 
102,the wide sea keeps him trapped upon some island  captured by fierce men who will not let him go 
103,now i will make a prophecy the gods have given me 
104,and i think it will all come true  although i am no prophet 
105,he will not be gone much longer from his own dear native land  even if chains of iron hold him fast 
106,he will devise a means of getting home 
107,he is resourceful 
108,tell me now are you odysseus son 
109,you are so tall  your handsome face and eyes resemble his 
110,we often met and knew each other well  before he went to troy  where all the best
111,leaders of argos sailed in hollow ships 
112,from that time on  we have not seen each other 
113,telemachus was careful as he answered 
114,dear guest  i will be frank with you 
115,my mother says that i am his son  but i cannot be sure  since no one knows his own begetting 
116,i wish i were the son of someone lucky  who could grow old at home with all his wealth 
117,instead  the most unlucky man alive is said to be my father since you ask 
118,athena looked at him with sparkling eyes 
119,son of penelope  you and your sons will make a name in history  since you are so clever 
120,but now tell me this 
121,who are these banqueters 
122,and what is the occasion 
123,a drinking party  or a wedding feast 
124,they look so arrogant and self indulgent  making themselves at home 
125,a wise observer would surely disapprove of how they act 
126,telemachus said moodily  my friend 
127,since you have raised the subject  there was once a time when this house here was doing well  our future bright  when he was still at home 
128,but now the gods have changed their plans and cursed us  and cast my father into utter darkness 
129,if he had died it would not be this bad if he had fallen with his friends at troy  or in his loved ones arms  when he had wound the threads of war to end 
130,the greeks would then have built a tomb for him  he would have won
131,fame for his son 
132,but now  the winds have seized him  and he is nameless and unknown 
133,he left nothing but tears for me  i do not weep only for him 
134,the gods have given me so many other troubles 
135,all the chiefs of same  zacynthus  dulichium  and local lords  from rocky ithaca  are courting mother  wasting our whole house 
136,she does not turn these awful suitors down  nor can she end the courting 
137,they keep eating 
138,spoiling my house and soon  they will kill me  athena said in outrage  this is monstrous  you need odysseus to come back home and lay his hands on all those shameless suitors  if only he would come here now and stand right at the gates  with two spears in his hands  in shield and helmet  as when i first saw him  odysseus was visiting our house  drinking and having fun on his way back from sailing in swift ships to ephyra
139,to visit ilus 
140,he had gone there looking for deadly poison to anoint his arrows 
141,ilus refused  because he feared the gods 
142,my father gave odysseus the poison  loving him blindly 
143,may odysseus come meet the suitors with that urge to kill  a bitter courtship and short life for them  but whether he comes home to take revenge  or not  is with the gods 
144,you must consider how best to drive these suitors from your house 
145,come  listen carefully to what i say 
146,tomorrow call the achaean chiefs to meeting  and tell the suitors let the gods be witness all of you  go away  to your own homes  as for your mother  if she wants to marry  let her return to her great father s home 
147,they will make her a wedding and prepare abundant gifts to show her father s love 
148,now here is some advice from me for you 
149,fit out a ship with twenty oars  the best 
150,and go find out about your long lost father 
151,someone may tell you news  or you may hear a voice from zeus  best source of information 
152,first go to pylos  question godlike nestor  from there  to sparta  visit menelaus 
153,he came home last of all the achaean heroes 
154,if you should hear that he is still alive and coming home  put up with this abuse for one more year 
155,but if you hear that he is dead  go home  and build a tomb for him 
156,and hold a lavish funeral to show the honor he deserves  and give your mother in marriage to a man  when this is done  consider deeply how you might be able to kill the suitors in your halls by tricks or openly 
157,you must not stick to childhood  you are no longer just a little boy 
158,you surely heard how everybody praised orestes when he killed the man who killed his famous father devious aegisthus 
159,dear boy  i see how big and tall you are 
160,be brave  and win yourself a lasting name 
161,but i must go now  on my speedy ship  my friends are getting tired of waiting for me  remember what i said and heed my words 
162,telemachus was brooding on her words  and said  dear guest  you were so kind to give me this fatherly advice 
163,i will remember 
164,i know that you are eager to be off  but please enjoy a bath before you go 
165,and take a gift with you 
166,i want to give you a precious  pretty treasure as a keepsake to mark our special friendship 
167,but the goddess athena met his gaze and said  do not hold me back now 
168,i must be on my way 
169,as for the gift you feel inspired to give me  save it for when i come on my way home and let me give you presents then as well in fair exchange 
170,with that  the owl eyed goddess flew away like a bird  up through the smoke 
171,she left him feeling braver  more determined  and with his father even more in mind 
172,watching her go  he was amazed and saw she was a god 
173,then godlike  he went off to meet the suitors 
174,they were sitting calmly  listening to the poet  who sang how athena cursed the journey of the greeks as they were sailing home from troy 
175,upstairs  penelope had heard the marvelous song 
176,she clambered down the steep steps of her house 
177,not by herself two slave girls came with her 
178,she reached the suitors looking like a goddess  then stopped and stood beside a sturdy pillar  holding a gauzy veil before her face 
179,her slave girls stood  one on each side of her 
180,in tears  she told the holy singer  stop  please phemius  you know so many songs  enchanting tales of things that gods and men have done  the deeds that singers publicize 
181,sing something else  and let them drink in peace 
182,stop this upsetting song that always breaks my heart  so i can hardly bear my grief 
183,i miss him all the time that man  my husband  whose story is so famous throughout greece 
184,sullen telemachus said  mother  no  you must not criticize the loyal bard for singing as it pleases him to sing 
185,poets are not to blame for how things are  zeus is  he gives to each as is his will 
186,do not blame phemius because he told
187,about the greek disasters 
188,you must know the newest song is always praised the most 
189,so steel your heart and listen to the song 
190,odysseus was not the only one who did not come back home again from troy 
191,many were lost 
192,go in and do your work 
193,stick to the loom and distaff 
194,tell your slaves to do their chores as well 
195,it is for men to talk  especially me  i am the master 
196,that startled her 
197,she went back to her room 
198,and took her son s uneasy words to heart 
199,she went upstairs  along with both her slaves  and wept there for her dear odysseus  until athena gave her eyes sweet sleep 
200,throughout the shadowy hall the suitors clamored  praying to lie beside her in her bed 
201,telemachus inhaled  then started speaking 
202,you suitors  you are taking this too far 
203,let us enjoy the feast in peace 
204,it is a lovely thing to listen to a bard 
205,especially one with such a godlike voice 
206,at dawn  let us assemble in the square 
207,i have to tell you this it is an order 
208,you have to leave my halls 
209,go dine elsewhere  eat your own food  or share between your houses 
210,or if you think it easier and better to ruin one man s wealth  and if you think that you can get away with it go on  i call upon the gods  zeus will grant vengeance 
211,you will be punished and destroyed  right here 
212,he spoke  and they began to bite their lips  shocked that telemachus would dare to speak so boldly 
213,but antinous replied  telemachus  the gods themselves have taught you such pride  to talk so big and brash in public  may zeus the son of cronus never grant you your true inheritance  which is the throne of ithaca 
214,his mind alert and focused  telemachus replied  antinous  you will not like this  but i have to say 
215,i hope zeus does give me the throne 
216,do you deny it is an honorable thing to be a king 
217,it brings the household wealth  and honor to the man  but there are many other great chiefs in sea girt ithaca  both old and young 
218,i know that 
219,one of them may seize the throne  now that odysseus has died 
220,but i shall be at least the lord of my own house and of the slaves that he seized for my benefit 
221,eurymachus
222,replied  telemachus  the gods must choose which of us will be king of ithaca 
223,but still  i hope you keep your own possessions  and rule your house 
224,may no man drive you out  and seize your wealth  while ithaca survives 
225,now  friend  i want to ask about the stranger 
226,where was he from  what country 
227,did he say 
228,where is his place of birth  his native soil 
229,does he bring news your father will come home 
230,or did he come here for some other purpose 
231,how suddenly he darted off  not waiting for us to meet him 
232,yet he looked important 
233,the boy said soberly  eurymachus  my father is not ever coming home 
234,i do not listen now to any gossip  or forecasts from the psychics whom my mother invites to visit us 
235,the stranger was my father s guest friend mentes  son of wise anchialus  who rules the taphians  the people of the oar 
236,those were his words 
237,but in his mind he knew she was a god 
238,they danced to music and enjoyed themselves till evening  then they went back home to sleep 
239,telemachus bedroom had been built above the courtyard  so it had a view 
240,he went upstairs  preoccupied by thought 
241,a loyal slave went with him  eurycleia  daughter of ops  she brought the burning torches 
242,laertes bought her many years before when she was very young  for twenty oxen 
243,he gave her status in the household  equal to his own wife  but never slept with her  avoiding bitter feelings in his marriage 
244,she brought the torches now  she was the slave who loved him most  since she had cared for him when he was tiny 
245,entering the room  he sat down on the bed  took off his tunic  and gave it to the vigilant old woman 
246,she smoothed it out and folded it  then hung it up on a hook beside his wooden bed 
247,and left the room 
248,she used the silver latch to close the door  the strap pulled tight the bolt 
249,he slept the night there  wrapped in woolen blankets  planning the journey told him by athena 
250,a dangerous journey the early dawn was born  her fingers bloomed 
251,odysseus well beloved son jumped up  put on his clothes  and strapped his sword across his back  and tied his handsome sandals onto his well oiled feet 
252,he left the room looking just like a god 
253,he quickly told the clear voiced heralds they must call the greeks to council 
254,soon the men  their long hair flowing  were gathered all together in the square 
255,telemachus arrived  bronze sword in hand 
256,not by himself two swift dogs came with him 
257,athena poured a heavenly grace upon him 
258,the elders let him join them  and he sat upon his father s throne 
259,the first to speak was wise aegyptius  a bent old soldier 
260,his darling son  the spear man antiphus  had sailed with lord odysseus to troy  the cyclops killed him in his cave and made him his final course at dinner 
261,this old father had three sons left 
262,one teamed up with the suitors
263,eurynomus 
264,the others spent their time working the farm 
265,but still the father mourned the son whom he had lost 
266,he spoke in tears 
267,people of ithaca  now hear my words 
268,we have not met in council since the day odysseus departed with his ships 
269,who called us 
270,someone old or young 
271,and why 
272,has he found out an army is approaching 
273,or does he have some other piece of news which he would like to share with all of us 
274,i think he is a helpful  decent man  i hope that zeus rewards his good intentions  odysseus loving son felt glad  and eagerly got up to speak and stood among them  in the center of the group 
275,the competent official  named pisenor  passed him the speaking stick  he held it up  and first addressed aegyptius 
276,here  sir  now look no further for the man you seek 
277,i called the meeting 
278,i am in deep trouble 
279,i have no information of an army that might attack us  nor do i have news of any other danger to our people 
280,i need help for myself 
281,my family has suffered two disasters 
282,first i lost my father  who was kind to you as if you also were his sons 
283,now  even worse  my house is being ripped apart  my wealth will soon be gone  the sons of all the nobles have shoved inside my house to court my mother 
284,against her wishes 
285,they should go and ask icarius her father to provide a dowry  and choose who should be her husband 
286,they are too scared 
287,instead  they haunt our house day after day  and kill our cows and pigs and good fat goats 
288,they feast and drink red wine  not caring if they waste it all 
289,there is no man to save the house no man like him  odysseus 
290,i cannot fight against them  i would be useless 
291,i have had no training 
292,but if i had the power  i would do it  it is unbearable  what they have done  they ruined my whole house  it is not fair  you suitors all should feel ashamed  consider what others in the neighborhood will think  and also be afraid  the angry gods will turn on you in rage  they will be shocked at all this criminal behavior  i beg you  by olympian zeus  and by the goddess who presides in human meetings 
293,justice  but never mind 
294,friends  leave me be  and let me cry and suffer by myself 
295,or did odysseus  my warlike father  deliberately do harm to our own side 
296,is that why you seem set on hurting me  encouraging these suitors 
297,oh  if only you ithacans would eat my stock yourselves  if you did that  i soon would get revenge  i would come through the town and keep demanding  until it all got given back 
298,but now 
299,you make me so unhappy  this is pointless  he stopped  frustrated  flung the scepter down  and burst out crying 
300,everyone was seized by pity 
301,no one spoke  they hesitated to answer him unkindly 
302,then at last antinous began 
303,telemachus  you stuck up  wilful little boy  how dare you try to embarrass us and put the blame on us 
304,we suitors have not done you wrong 
305,go blame your precious mother  she is cunning 
306,it is the third year  soon it will be four  that she has cheated us of what we want 
307,she offers hope to all  sends notes to each  but all the while her mind moves somewhere else 
308,she came up with a special trick  she fixed a mighty loom inside the palace hall 
309,weaving her fine long cloth  she said to us  young men  you are my suitors 
310,since my husband  the brave odysseus  is dead  i know you want to marry me  you must be patient 
311,i have worked hard to weave this winding sheet to bury good laertes when he dies 
312,he gained such wealth  the women would reproach me if he were buried with no shroud 
313,please let me finish it  and her words made sense to us 
314,so every day she wove the mighty cloth  and then at night by torchlight  she unwove it 
315,for three long years her trick beguiled the greeks 
316,but when the fourth year s seasons rolled around  a woman slave who knew the truth told us 
317,we caught her there  unraveling the cloth  and made her finish it 
318,this is our answer  so you and all the greeks may understand 
319,dismiss your mother  let her father tell her to marry anyone his heart desires 
320,athena blessed her with intelligence  great artistry and skill  a finer mind than anyone has ever had before  even the braided girls of ancient greece  tyro  alcmene  garlanded mycene
321,none of them had penelope s understanding 
322,but if she wants to go on hurting us  her plans are contrary to destiny 
323,we suitors will keep eating up your wealth  and livelihood  as long as she pursues this plan the gods have put inside her heart 
324,for her it may be glory  but for you  pure loss 
325,we will not go back to our farms or anywhere  until she picks a husband 
326,telemachus insisted  breathing hard 
327,antinous  i cannot force my mother out of the house 
328,she gave me birth and raised me  my father is elsewhere alive or dead 
329,if i insist my mother has to leave  icarius will make me pay the price  and gods will send more trouble  if she goes  mother will rouse up furies full of hate to take revenge  and everyone will curse me  i will not 
330,if you feel upset  you go  out of my house  stop eating all my food 
331,devour each other s property  not mine  or do you really think it right to waste one person s means of life  and go scot free 
332,then try it  i will call the deathless gods  may zeus give recompense some day for this  you will die here  and nobody will care  then zeus  whose voice resounds around the world  sent down two eagles from the mountain peak 
333,at first they hovered on the breath of wind  close by each other  balanced on their wings 
334,reaching the noisy middle of the crowd  they wheeled and whirred and flapped their mighty wings  swooping at each man s head with eyes like death  and with their talons ripped each face and neck 
335,then to the right they flew  across the town 
336,everyone was astonished at the sight  they wondered in their hearts what this could mean 
337,old halitherses  son of mastor  spoke 
338,more than the other elders  this old leader excelled at prophecy and knew the birds 
339,he gave them good advice 
340,now ithacans  listen  i speak especially for the suitors 
341,disaster rolls their way  odysseus will not be absent from his friends for long  already he is near and sows the seeds of death for all of them  and more disaster for many others in bright ithaca 
342,we have to form a plan to make them stop 
343,that would be best for them as well by far 
344,i am experienced at prophecy 
345,my words came true for him  that mastermind  odysseus 
346,i told him when he left for troy with all the argives  he would suffer most terribly  and all his men would die  but in the twentieth year he would come home  unrecognized 
347,now it is coming true 
348,eurymachus  the son of polybus  replied  old man  be off  go home and spout your portents to your children  or it will be worse for them 
349,but i can read these omens
350,better than you can 
351,many birds go flying in sunlight  and not all are meaningful 
352,odysseus is dead  away from home 
353,i wish that you had died with him  to stop your forecasts  you are making this boy angry  hoping that he will give your household gifts 
354,but let me tell you this  which will come true 
355,you may know many ancient forms of wisdom  but if you tease this boy and make him angry  he will be hurt  and never get to act
356,on any of these prophecies of yours 
357,and  old man  we will make you pay so much your heart will break  your pain will cut so deep 
358,i will advise telemachus myself  in front of everyone  to send his mother back to her father s family  to fix her wedding  and the gifts a well loved daughter should have 
359,unless he does that  we will never cease from this torturous courtship 
360,we are not afraid of anyone  much less this boy
361,with his long speeches  nor your pointless portents 
362,they will not come to pass and they will make you hated 
363,his house will be devoured  and payback will never come  as long as she frustrates our hopes of marriage 
364,meanwhile  we will wait in daily hope  competing for the prize  not seeking other women as our wives 
365,telemachus  his mind made up  replied  all right  eurymachus  and all of you 
366,i will not talk about this anymore 
367,the gods and all of you already know 
368,just let me have a ship and twenty men to make a journey with me  out and back  to sparta and to sandy pylos  seeking news about when my father may come home 
369,i may hear it from somebody  or from a voice from zeus it often happens so 
370,if i find out my father is alive and coming home  i will endure this pain for one more year 
371,but if i hear that he
372,is dead  i will come home to my own land  and build a tomb and hold the funeral rites as he deserves  and i will give my mother to a new husband 
373,he sat down  and up stood mentor 
374,when odysseus sailed off  this was the friend he asked to guard his house and told the slaves to look to him as master 
375,mentor addressed the crowd 
376,now ithacans  listen  this changes everything  now kings should never try to judge with righteousness
377,or rule their people gently 
378,kings should always be cruel  since the people whom he ruled as kindly as a father  have forgotten their king odysseus 
379,i do not blame the suitors overconfidence  rough ways and violence  in eating up his household  they risk their lives  supposing that the master will never come back home 
380,but i do blame you others  sitting passive  never speaking against them  though you far outnumber them 
381,leocritus  euenor s son  replied  mentor  for shame  you must have lost your mind  fool  telling us to stop our banqueting  you could not fight us  we outnumber you 
382,even if ithacan odysseus came back and found us feasting in his house  and tried to drive us out  his wife would get no joy of his return  no matter how she misses him 
383,if he tried fighting solo against us  he would die a cruel death 
384,so what you said was nonsense 
385,anyway  we must disperse  and everyone get busy 
386,mentor and halitherses  since you are old comrades of his father  you can guide telemachus journey 
387,i suspect he will not manage to go anywhere  he will just wait in ithaca for news 
388,the crowd broke up  the ithacans went home  the suitors  to odysseus house 
389,telemachus slipped out and at the beach
390,he dipped his hands in salty gray seawater  and asked athena  goddess  hear my prayer  just yesterday you came and ordered me to sail the hazy sea and find out news of my long absent father s journey home 
391,the greeks are wasting everything  especially these bullying  mean suitors 
392,then athena came near him with the voice and guise of mentor  and spoke to him with words that flew like birds 
393,telemachus  you will be brave and thoughtful 
394,if your own father s forcefulness runs through you 
395,how capable he was  in word and deed  your journey will succeed  if you are his 
396,if you are not his son  his true born son  i doubt you can achieve what you desire 
397,and it is rare for sons to be like fathers  only a few are better  most are worse 
398,but you will be no coward and no fool 
399,you do possess your father s cunning mind  so there is hope you will do all these things 
400,forget about those foolish suitors plans 
401,they have no brains and no morality 
402,they do not know black doom will kill them all  and some day soon  their death is near at hand 
403,you will achieve the journey that you seek  since i will go with you  just like a father 
404,i will equip a good swift ship for you 
405,now go back home to where those suitors are  and get provisions 
406,pack them in containers  some wine in jars  and grain  the strength of men 
407,in sturdy skins 
408,and i will go through town  calling for volunteers to come with us 
409,there are a lot of ships in ithaca  both new and old 
410,i will select the best one  we will equip her quickly and sail fast  far off across the sea 
411,so spoke the goddess  daughter of zeus 
412,telemachus obeyed 
413,his heart was troubled as he went back home 
414,he found the arrogant suitors in the hall  skinning some goats and charring hogs for dinner 
415,antinous began to laugh 
416,he called him  and seized his hand and spoke these words to him 
417,telemachus  you are being so pigheaded  why not put all your troubles from your heart 
418,come eat and drink with me  just as before 
419,you know the greeks will fix it all for you 
420,they will select a ship and crew  and soon you will reach pylos  where you hope to hear word of your father 
421,but the boy was wary  and said  antinous  i cannot eat 
422,i have no peace or joy when i am with you selfish suitors 
423,is it not enough that you destroyed my rich inheritance when i was just a little boy 
424,but now i have grown bigger  and i got advice from other people  and my heart wells up with courage 
425,i will try to bring down doom on your heads here at home or when i go to pylos 
426,yes  i really will go there  as passenger  although i do not own
427,a ship or have a crew because of you  he snatched his hand away 
428,but as they feasted  the suitors started mocking him and jeering 
429,with sneers they said  oh no  telemachus is going to kill us  he will bring supporters from pylos or from sparta he is quite determined  or indeed he may be fetching some lethal poisons from the fertile fields of ephyra  to mix up in our wine bowl and kill us all  another proud young man
430,said  well  who knows  perhaps he will get lost in that curved ship  and die  so far away from all his family just like his father 
431,and what a pity that would be for us  then we would have to share out all his wealth  and give away the house itself to her his mother  and the man who marries her 
432,the boy went downstairs  to his father s storeroom  wide and high roofed  piled high with gold and bronze and clothes in chests and fragrant olive oil 
433,down there the jars of vintage wine were stored  which held the sweet  unmixed and godlike drink  lined in a row against the wall  in case weary odysseus came home at last 
434,the double doors were locked and closely fitted 
435,a woman checked the contents  night and day  guarding it all with great intelligence  and that was eurycleia  child of ops 
436,he called her to the chamber and addressed her 
437,nanny  please pour sweet wine in jugs for me 
438,the second best one  not the one you keep for when the poor unlucky king escapes from evil fate and death  and comes back home 
439,fill up twelve jugs with wine for me  and pour me some twenty pounds of fine milled barley groats  all packed in sturdy leather bags 
440,load up all these provisions secretly 
441,at nightfall  i will come here and get them  when my mother has gone upstairs to go to sleep 
442,i am leaving for sparta and for sandy pylos 
443,to learn about my father s journey home 
444,at that his loving nurse began to wail  and sobbed  sweet child  what gave you this idea 
445,why do you want to go so far 
446,you are an only child  and dearly loved  the king  odysseus  is gone  lost  far from home  and they will plot against you when you leave  scheming to murder you and share this wealth 
447,stay with us  we who love you  do not go searching for danger out on restless seas 
448,telemachus decisively replied  nanny  you need not worry 
449,gods have blessed this plan 
450,but promise me you will not tell mother  until she notices me gone 
451,say nothing for twelve days  so she will not start crying  it would spoil her pretty skin 
452,at that the old nurse swore a mighty oath by all the gods that she would keep the secret  and then she drew the wine for him in jars  and poured the barley groats in well stitched bags 
453,telemachus returned to see the suitors 
454,meanwhile  bright eyed athena had a plan 
455,resembling telemachus  she went all through the city  standing by each man  and urged them to assemble by the ship at night  and asked the son of phronius  no mon  for his speedy ship  he promised to give it gladly 
456,then the sun went down and all the streets grew dark 
457,the goddess dragged the ship into the water  and she loaded
458,the necessary tackle for a journey 
459,right at the beach s farthest end the goddess stood and assembled good strong men as crew  she coached each one 
460,then  eyes ablaze with plans  she went back to odysseus house  and poured sweet sleep upon the drunken suitors 
461,she struck them and their cups fell from their hands 
462,disguised as mentor both in looks and voice  she called the boy out from the mighty hall  and looked intently in his face  and said 
463,telemachus  your crew of armored men is ready at the oar for your departure 
464,come on  no time to waste  we must be gone  so speaking  pallas quickly led the boy  he followed in the footsteps of the goddess 
465,they went down to the seashore and the ship  and found the long haired sailors on the beach 
466,inspired and confident  telemachus called out  my friends  come on  let us go fetch the rations  they are ready in the hall 
467,but quietly my mother does not know  nor do the other women  except one 
468,and so he led them  and they followed him 
469,they loaded everything upon the decks  odysseus son instructed them  and then embarked athena led the way 
470,she sat down in the stern  and next to her telemachus was sitting 
471,then the crew released the ropes and boarded  each at oar 
472,athena called a favorable wind 
473,pure zephyr whistling on wine dark sea 
474,telemachus commanded his companions to seize the rigging  so they did  and raised the pine wood mast inside the rounded block  and bound it down with forestays round about  and raised the bright white sails with leather ropes 
475,wind blew the middle sail  the purple wave was splashing loudly round the moving keel 
476,the goddess rode the waves and smoothed the way 
477,the quick black ship held steady  so they fastened
478,the tackle down  and filled their cups with wine 
479,they poured libations to the deathless gods  especially to the bright eyed child of zeus 
480,all through the night till dawn the ship sailed on 
481,an old king remembers leaving the ocean s streams  the sun leapt up into the sky of bronze  to shine his light for gods and mortals on the fertile earth 
482,telemachus arrived in pylos  where the pylians were bringing to the beach black bulls for blue poseidon  lord of earthquakes 
483,there were nine benches  fifty men on each  and each group had nine bulls to sacrifice 
484,they burned the thigh bones for the god  and ate the innards 
485,then the ithacans arrived 
486,took down their sails  dropped anchor and alighted 
487,the goddess with the flashing eyes  athena  first led telemachus onshore  then spoke 
488,do not be shy  telemachus 
489,you sailed over the sea to ask about your father  where the earth hides him  what his fate might be 
490,so hurry now to nestor  lord of horses 
491,learn what advice he has in mind for you 
492,supplicate him yourself  and he will tell you the truth  he is not one to tell a lie 
493,telemachus replied  but mentor  how can i approach and talk to him 
494,i am quite inexperienced at making speeches  and as a young man  i feel awkward talking to elders 
495,she looked straight into his eyes  and answered  you will work out what to do  through your own wits and with divine assistance 
496,the gods have blessed you in your life so far 
497,so pallas spoke and quickly led him on  he followed in the footsteps of the goddess 
498,they reached the center of the town  where nestor was sitting with his sons and his companions  putting the meat on spits and roasting it for dinner 
499,when they saw the strangers coming  they all stood up with open arms to greet them  inviting them to join them 
500,nestor s son  pisistratus  shook hands and sat them down  spreading soft fleeces on the sand beside his father and his brother  thrasymedes 
501,he served them giblets and he poured some wine
502,into a golden cup  and raised a toast to pallas  child of zeus the aegis lord 
503,now guest  give prayers of thanks to lord poseidon  and pour libations for the god 
504,this feast is in his honor  pay him proper dues 
505,then give the boy the cup of honeyed wine  so he can offer to the deathless gods libations 
506,everybody needs the gods 
507,i give the golden chalice to you first  because the boy is younger  more my age 
508,he put the cup of sweet wine in her hand 
509,athena was impressed with his good manners  because he rightly gave it first to her 
510,at once she made a heartfelt prayer 
511,poseidon  o shaker of the earth  do not refuse to grant our prayer  may all these things come true 
512,bring fame to nestor and his sons  and grant gifts to the pylians  as recompense for this fine sacrifice 
513,and may the quest for which we sailed here in our swift black ship
514,succeed  and may we come home safe again 
515,she made her prayer come true all by herself 
516,she gave telemachus the splendid cup with double handle  and his prayer matched hers 
517,and then they cooked the outer parts of meat  and helped themselves to pieces  sharing round the glorious feast  till they could eat no more 
518,then first gerenian nestor  horse lord  spoke 
519,now that our guests are satisfied with food  time now to talk to them and ask them questions 
520,strangers  who are you 
521,where did you sail from 
522,are you on business  or just scouting round like pirates on the sea  who risk their lives to ravage foreign homes 
523,telemachus was thoughtful but not shy 
524,athena gave him the confidence deep in his heart to ask about his absent father  and to gain a noble reputation for himself 
525,great nestor  son of neleus  he said  you ask where i am from 
526,i will be frank 
527,i come from ithaca  beneath mount neion  and i am here on private  family business 
528,i came to gather news about my father  long suffering odysseus 
529,they say he fought with you to sack the town of troy 
530,we know the place where all the other men who battled with the trojans lost their lives 
531,but zeus still keeps odysseus fate in darkness  no one knows where he was lost 
532,maybe some hostile men killed him on land 
533,or he was drowned in amphitrite s waves 
534,i beg you  tell me  did you see him die with your own eyes 
535,or have you any news about where he may be 
536,he must be lost 
537,his mother surely bore him for misfortune 
538,you need not sweeten what you say  in pity or from embarrassment 
539,just tell me straight what your eyes saw of him  my noble father 
540,if ever he made promises to you and kept his word at troy  in times of trouble 
541,remember those times now 
542,tell me the truth  gerenian nestor  horse lord  answered him  dear boy  you call to mind how much we suffered  with strong  unyielding hearts  in distant lands when we were sailing over misty seas  led by achilles on a hunt for spoils  and when we fought around the mighty city of priam 
543,our best warriors were killed 
544,ajax lies dead there  and there lies achilles  there lies his godlike friend and guide  patroclus 
545,my own strong  matchless son lies dead there too  antilochus  who fought and ran so well 
546,more pain  more grief our sufferings increased 
547,who could recount so many  many losses 
548,if you stayed here five years and kept on asking how many things the fighters suffered there  you would get bored and go back home again before the story ended 
549,nine long years we schemed to bring them down  and finally zeus made our plots succeed 
550,odysseus 
551,your father  if you really are his son well  no one dared to try to equal him in cleverness 
552,that man was always best at every kind of trick 
553,and seeing you  i am amazed at how you talk like him 
554,one would not think so young a man could do it 
555,well  back in troy  odysseus and i always agreed in councils  with one mind 
556,we gave the argives all the best advice 
557,after we conquered priam s lofty town 
558,a god dispersed the ships of the achaeans 
559,zeus planned a bitter journey home for us  since some of us had neither sense nor morals 
560,gray eyed athena  daughter of the thunder  became enraged and brought about disaster 
561,she set the sons of atreus to fight each other 
562,hastily  they called the people at sunset  not observing proper norms 
563,the men arrived already drunk on wine  the brothers told them why they called the meeting 
564,then menelaus said that it was time to sail back home across the open sea 
565,but agamemnon disagreed entirely 
566,he wanted them to stay and sacrifice to heal the sickness of athena s wrath pointless  he did not know she would not yield 
567,the minds of the immortals rarely change 
568,so those two stood and argued angrily  and with a dreadful clash of arms the greeks leapt up on two opposing sides 
569,we slept
570,that eerie night with hearts intent on hatred against each other since zeus meant us harm 
571,at dawn one group of us dragged down our ships into the sea piled high with loot and women  while half the army still remained there  stationed with agamemnon  shepherd of the people 
572,my friends and i set sail with all good speed a god had made the choppy sea lie calm 
573,we came to tenedos and sacrificed  praying to get back home but zeus refused 
574,the cruel god roused yet more strife among us 
575,your father s plans were always flexible  his men turned round their prows and sailed right back to make their peace again with agamemnon 
576,but i assembled all my fleet  and fled i understood some god must mean us harm 
577,then diomedes roused his men to come  and ruddy menelaus quickly sailed to meet with us on lesbos  and we pondered our long sea journey 
578,should we travel north 
579,go past the rocks of chios to our left  to psyria  or under chios  passing blustery mimas 
580,so we prayed for signs 
581,the god told us to cross the open sea towards euboea  to escape disaster 
582,a fair wind whistled and our ships sped on across the journey ways of fish  and landed at nightfall in geraestus 
583,to poseidon we offered many bulls  since we had crossed safely across wide waters 
584,the fourth day
585,the men of diomedes moored their ships at argos  i kept going on  to pylos 
586,the wind the god had sent kept holding strong the whole way home 
587,so  my dear boy  i have no news about what happened next 
588,i do not know which of them has died and who is safe 
589,but i can tell you what i heard while sitting here in my halls 
590,you ought to know 
591,they say achilles son led home the myrmidons  and philoctetes came back home with glory 
592,and idomeneus led back his crew to crete  no man of his who had survived the war was lost at sea 
593,and agamemnon 
594,you must have heard  though you live far away 
595,aegisthus murdered him  but he has paid a bitter price 
596,how fortunate the dead man had left a son to take revenge upon the wicked  scheming killer  that aegisthus  who killed orestes father 
597,my dear boy  i see that you are tall and strong 
598,be brave 
599,so you will be remembered 
600,thoughtfully telemachus replied  your majesty  king nestor  yes 
601,orestes took revenge 
602,the greeks will make him famous through the world and into future times 
603,i wish the gods would grant me that much power against those men who threaten and insult me those cruel suitors  the gods have not yet granted us this blessing  my father and myself 
604,we must endure 
605,gerenian nestor  lord of horses  answered 
606,dear boy  since you have brought the subject up  i have been told about your mother s suitors  how badly they are treating you at home 
607,but do you willingly submit to it 
608,or has a god s voice led the townspeople to hate you 
609,well  who knows  perhaps one day he will come home and take revenge  alone  or with an army of the greeks 
610,if only athena loved you  as she used to care for glorious odysseus at troy
611,when we were doing badly 
612,i have never seen gods display such favor as she gave when she stood by your father 
613,if she helped you with that much love  the suitors would forget their hopes for marriage 
614,then telemachus replied  my lord  i doubt that this will happen 
615,i am surprised you have such confidence 
616,i would not be so hopeful  even if the gods were willing 
617,then the goddess spoke 
618,telemachus  what do you mean 
619,a god
620,can easily save anyone  at will  no matter what the distance 
621,i would rather suffer immensely  but then get home safe  than die on my return like agamemnon  murdered by his own wife  and by aegisthus 
622,but death is universal 
623,even gods cannot protect the people that they love  when fate and cruel death catch up with them 
624,telemachus said apprehensively  mentor  this is upsetting 
625,change the subject 
626,he has no real chance now of getting home 
627,the gods have fenced him round with death and darkness 
628,let me ask nestor something else he is wiser and more informed than anyone 
629,they say he ruled for three whole generations 
630,he looks to me like some immortal god 
631,so nestor  son of neleus  tell me truly  how did the great king agamemnon die 
632,and where was menelaus 
633,was he lost  away from greece  when that aegisthus dared
634,to kill a king  a better man than him 
635,how did that wicked trickster s plot succeed 
636,gerenian nestor  lord of horses  answered  i will tell everything though you can guess what would have happened if fair menelaus had found aegisthus living in his halls on his return 
637,and even when he died  no one would bury him  he lay upon the open plain without a tomb and far from town for birds and dogs to eat 
638,no greek
639,would mourn that monster 
640,while we fought and labored at troy  this layabout sat safe in argos  seducing clytemnestra  noble wife of agamemnon 
641,for a while  she scorned his foul suggestions  since her heart was good 
642,moreover  when her husband went to troy  he left a poet  ordered to protect her 
643,but finally fate forced the queen to yield 
644,aegisthus left the poet to be eaten by birds  abandoned on a desert island 
645,he led the woman back to his own house by mutual desire  and then he made numerous offerings on holy altars of animals and lovely gold and cloth  he had succeeded far beyond his hopes 
646,and meanwhile  i left troy with menelaus  we sailed together  best of friends 
647,we reached the holy cape of athens  sounion 
648,there phoebus with his gentle arrows shot and killed the pilot  phrontis  as he held
649,the ship s helm as she sped along 
650,no man knew better how to steer through any storm  so menelaus stopped to bury him with proper rites 
651,at last he sailed again across the wine dark sea  but as his ships rushed round the craggy heights of malea  far seeing zeus sent curses on his journey  pouring out screaming winds and giant waves the size of mountains splitting up the fleet 
652,some ships were hurled to crete  to river jardan 
653,where the cydonian people have their homes 
654,there steep rock rises sheer above the sea near gortyn in the misty deep  south winds drive mighty waves towards the left hand crag  and push them west to phaestus  one small rock restrains the massive currents 
655,all the ships were smashed by waves against those rocks 
656,the men were almost drowned 
657,five other dark prowed ships were blown by wind and sea away to egypt 
658,there menelaus gathered wealth and gold
659,and drifted with his ships through foreign lands 
660,meanwhile at home  aegisthus had been plotting 
661,he killed the son of atreus and seized control of rich mycenae  where he reigned for seven years 
662,but in the eighth  orestes came to destroy him 
663,he returned from athens  and killed his father s murderer  then called the argives to a funeral  a feast for clever  scheming  cowardly aegisthus whom he had killed  and his own hated mother 
664,that very day  rambunctious menelaus arrived with all his ships crammed full of treasure 
665,the moral is  you must not stay away too long  dear boy  when those proud suitors lurk inside your house 
666,they may divide your wealth among themselves and make your journey useless 
667,but i suggest you go to menelaus 
668,he recently returned from lands so distant no one would even hope to get home safe once driven by the winds so far off course 
669,over such dangerous  enormous seas 
670,birds migrate there and take a year or more to travel back 
671,go visit him by ship with your own crew 
672,or if you would prefer  you can go there by land here is a carriage 
673,my sons can guide you all the way to sparta  to menelaus 
674,ask him for the truth 
675,he will not lie  he is an honest man  the sun went down and darkness fell 
676,the goddess  bright eyed athena  spoke to them 
677,king nestor 
678,your speech was good and your advice was sound 
679,but now slice up the tongues and pour the wine for lord poseidon and the other gods before we rest time now to go to bed 
680,the light is fading and it is not right to linger at a banquet in the dark 
681,the people listened to athena s words 
682,the house slaves poured fresh water on their hands  and boys filled up the mixing bowls with wine  and poured it into cups  and first prepared
683,the sacrifice 
684,they threw tongues on the fire  then sprinkled wine  then each man drank his fill 
685,then zeus daughter and the godlike boy both rose to go together to their ship 
686,but nestor called to stop them 
687,zeus forbids it  and all the other gods who live forever  you cannot leave my house for your swift ship as if i were a poor and ragged man with so few beds and blankets in his home that neither he nor guests can sleep in comfort 
688,i have soft quilts and blankets in abundance 
689,the darling son of great odysseus must not sleep on the ship s deck  while i live  not while my sons remain here in my house  ready to welcome anyone who visits 
690,the bright eyed goddess answered him  old friend  you are quite right 
691,telemachus should do just as you say 
692,that is a better plan 
693,he will stay here tonight and go to sleep in your fine palace 
694,but i must go back
695,to tell the crew the news and keep them strong 
696,you see  i am the oldest in our party 
697,the rest are younger men  close friends together  the same age as our brave telemachus 
698,i will sleep there beside the hollow ship 
699,at dawn i have important obligations  to visit with the great cauconians 
700,the boy can be your guest 
701,then send him off escorted by your son 
702,give him a carriage  drawn by your strongest and most nimble horses 
703,bright eyed athena flew away  transformed into an ossifrage 
704,astonishment seized all the people watching  even nestor 
705,he seized telemachus hand and said  dear boy  i am now sure that you will be a hero  since the gods are on your side at your young age 
706,this was a god  none other than great athena  true born child of zeus  who also glorified your noble father 
707,goddess  be kind to us as well  and grant
708,honor to me  my good wife  and our sons 
709,now i will sacrifice a yearling heifer  broad browed and still unyoked  and gild her horns with gold to bless your journey 
710,so he spoke  and pallas heard his prayer 
711,gerenian nestor led them and led his sons and sons in law inside his own magnificent great hall 
712,when they were all inside  he seated them on benches and on chairs arranged in order  and he himself mixed up the bowl for them
713,of sweet delicious wine 
714,he had preserved it eleven years 
715,the slave girl opened it  pulling the lid off 
716,as the old man mixed  he prayed and poured libations for athena 
717,they all poured also  then they drank their fill  then each went home to sleep in his own chamber 
718,nestor the horseman made a special bed right there for his dear friend  the warrior s son  a camp bed on the echoing portico  beside pisistratus  the only son
719,not living with a wife but still at home 
720,nestor himself slept by his wife  the queen  in a secluded corner of the palace 
721,when newborn dawn appeared with rosy fingers  the horse lord nestor jumped up out of bed  and hurried down towards the polished stones that stood outside his palace  bright with oil 
722,there neleus used to give godlike advice  until fate took him and he went to hades  and nestor  guardian of the greeks  took over
723,the scepter 
724,from their rooms his sons arrived to throng around him  echephron and stratius  aretus  perseus  great thrasymedes  and strong pisistratus the sixth 
725,they brought godlike telemachus to sit with them 
726,nestor spoke first 
727,dear sons  now hurry up  fulfill my wishes 
728,first we must appease athena  who revealed herself to me during the holy feast 
729,now one of you must run down to the fields to choose a cow 
730,let herdsmen drive her back here 
731,and another  go to telemachus ship and bring the men leave only two behind 
732,another must bring laerces here  who pours the gold  so he can gild the heifer s horns 
733,you others  stay here together 
734,tell the girls inside to cook a royal feast  and set out seats  put wood around the altar  and clear water 
735,at that  the sons all got to work 
736,the cow was brought up from the field 
737,the crew arrived
738,from the swift  solid ship 
739,the goldsmith came with all the bronze tools useful for his trade hammer and anvil and well crafted tongs and worked the gold 
740,athena came to take the sacrifice 
741,king nestor gave the gold  the craftsman poured it on the horns  to make a lovely offering to please the goddess 
742,stratius and echephron together led the heifer by the horns 
743,aretes came and brought a water bowl adorned with flowers 
744,and in his other hand  a box of grain 
745,strong thrasymedes stood nearby and held a sharpened axe  prepared to strike the cow 
746,perseus held the blood bowl 
747,nestor started to sprinkle barley groats and ritual water  and as he threw the hairs into the fire he said prayers to athena 
748,when the rites were finished  mighty thrasymedes struck 
749,the axe sliced through the sinews of the neck 
750,the cow was paralyzed 
751,then nestor s daughters
752,and his sons wives  and his own loyal queen  eurydice  began to chant 
753,the men hoisted the body  and pisistratus sliced through her throat 
754,black blood poured out 
755,the life was gone 
756,they butchered her  cut out the thighs  all in the proper place  and covered them with double fat and placed raw flesh upon them 
757,the old king burned the pieces on the logs  and poured the bright red wine 
758,the young men came to stand beside him holding five pronged forks 
759,they burned the thigh bones thoroughly and tasted the entrails  then carved up the rest and skewered the meat on pointed spits  and roasted it 
760,meanwhile  telemachus was being washed by nestor s eldest daughter  polycaste 
761,when she had washed and rubbed his skin with oil she dressed him in a tunic and fine cloak and he emerged  his looks were like a god s 
762,he sat by nestor  shepherd of the people 
763,the meat was roasted and drawn off the spits 
764,they sat to eat  while trained slaves served the food  pouring the wine for them in golden cups 
765,after their hunger and their thirst were gone  gerenian nestor  horse lord  started talking 
766,my sons  now bring two horses with fine manes and yoke them to the carriage  so our guest can start his journey 
767,they obeyed at once  and quickly latched swift horses to the carriage 
768,one of the house girls brought out food and wine and delicacies fit to feed a king 
769,telemachus got in the lovely carriage  pisistratus  the son of nestor  followed  and sat beside him  taking up the reins  and whipped the horses 
770,eagerly they flew off for the open plain  and left the town 
771,all day they ran and made the harness rattle 
772,at sunset when the streets grew dark  they came to pherae  to the home of diocles  son of ortilochus  alpheus was his grandfather 
773,they spent the night as guests 
774,when rosy fingered dawn came bright and early  they yoked the horses to the painted carriage  and drove out from the gate and echoing porch 
775,at a light touch of whip  the horses flew 
776,swiftly they drew towards their journey s end  on through the fields of wheat  until the sun began to set and shadows filled the streets 
777,what the sea god said they came to sparta  land of caves and valleys  and drove to menelaus house 
778,they found him hosting a wedding feast for many guests to celebrate his children s marriages 
779,in troy he had declared that he would give his daughter to achilles son  who ruled the myrmidons 
780,now he was sending her  with dowry gifts of horse drawn chariots  the gods had made the marriage come to pass 
781,and he was welcoming a spartan bride 
782,alector s daughter  for his well loved son  strong megapenthes  mothered by a slave 
783,the gods had given helen no more children after the beautiful hermione  image of aphrodite all in gold 
784,neighbors and family were feasting gladly under the king s high roof 
785,the bard was singing and strumming  and two acrobats were spinning and leading them in dance 
786,telemachus and nestor s son stopped by the palace doors
787,and held their horses 
788,menelaus guard  eteoneus  ran out and saw them there  and then hurried back inside to tell his master 
789,your majesty  there are two men outside  strangers who seem like sons of zeus 
790,please tell me  should we take off the harness from their horses 
791,or send them off to find another host 
792,flushed menelaus shouted angrily  you used to have some brains  now you are talking like a silly child 
793,we two were fed by many different hosts before returning home 
794,as we may hope for zeus to keep us safe in future times  untack their horses  lead them in to dine  so eteoneus rushed out from the palace  and ordered other slaves to follow him 
795,they freed the sweating horses from their yoke and tied them by the manger  which they filled with emmer that they mixed with bright white barley 
796,they leaned the carriage up against the wall
797,and led their guests inside the godlike house 
798,the boys looked round the palace in amazement  the lofty halls of famous menelaus shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon 
799,when they had satisfied their eyes with staring  they went to take a bath in polished tubs 
800,the slave girls helped them wash and rubbed them down in olive oil  then dressed them in wool cloaks and tunics  and then seated them beside the son of atreus  king menelaus 
801,a house girl brought a basin made of silver  and water in a golden jug 
802,she poured it over their hands to wash  then set a table of polished wood beside them  and a humble slave girl brought bread and many canap s  a lavish spread 
803,the carver carried platters with every kind of meat  and set before them cups made of gold 
804,then ruddy menelaus welcomed them both and told them  help yourselves  enjoy the food  when you have shared our meal 
805,we will begin to ask you who you are 
806,your fathers must be scepter bearing kings  the sons of peasants do not look like you 
807,with that  he took the dish of rich roast meat  cut from the back  which was his special meal  and offered it to them 
808,they reached their hands to take the food set out in front of them 
809,after their thirst and hunger had been sated  telemachus turned round to nestor s son  ducking his head so no one else could hear 
810,pisistratus  dear friend  do you see how these echoing halls are shining bright with bronze  and silver  gold and ivory and amber 
811,it is as full of riches as the palace of zeus on mount olympus  i am struck with awe 
812,when menelaus heard his words  he spoke to them in turn his words flew out 
813,no mortal  my dear boys  can rival zeus 
814,his halls and home and property are deathless 
815,some man may match my wealth  or maybe not 
816,i suffered for it 
817,i was lost  adrift at sea for eight long years 
818,i traipsed through cyprus  phoenicia  egypt  ethiopia  sidon and araby  and libya  where lambs are born with horns their ewes give birth three times a year 
819,the master and his slave have milk and cheese and meat  the flock provides sweet milk year round 
820,but while i wandered there accumulating wealth  someone crept in and killed my brother  his own scheming wife
821,betrayed him 
822,i can take no joy in all my wealth 
823,whoever they may be  your fathers have surely told you how much i have suffered  i lost my lovely home  and i was parted for many years from all my splendid riches 
824,i wish i had stayed here  with just a third of all the treasure i have now acquired  if those who died at troy  so far away from argive pastures  were alive and well 
825,i sit here in my palace  mourning all
826,who died  and often weeping 
827,sometimes tears bring comfort to my heart  but not for long  cold grief grows sickening 
828,i miss them all  but one man most 
829,when i remember him  i cannot eat or sleep  since no one labored like him odysseus 
830,his destiny was suffering  and mine the endless pain of missing him 
831,we do not even know if he is still alive he has been gone so long 
832,his faithful wife and old laertes
833,must grieve for him  and young telemachus  who was a newborn when he went away 
834,these words roused in the boy a desperate need to mourn his father 
835,tears rolled down his face and splashed down on the ground 
836,he lifted up his cloak to hide his eyes 
837,but menelaus noticed and wondered whether he should wait until the boy first spoke about his father  or ask 
838,as he was hesitating  helen emerged from her high ceilinged  fragrant bedroom 
839,like artemis  who carries golden arrows 
840,adraste set a special chair for her  alcippe spread upon it soft wool blankets  and phylo brought a silver sewing basket  given to her by alcandre  the wife of polybus  who lived in thebes  in egypt  where people have extraordinary wealth 
841,he gave two silver tubs to menelaus  a pair of tripods and ten pounds of gold 
842,his wife gave other lovely gifts for helen 
843,a golden spindle and this silver basket on wheels  the rims were finished off with gold 
844,phylo  her girl  brought out that basket now  packed full of yarn she had already spun 
845,a spindle wound around with purple wool was laid across it 
846,she sat down and put her feet upon a stool  and asked her husband  do we know who these men are  menelaus  who have arrived here in our house 
847,shall i conceal my thoughts or speak 
848,i feel compelled
849,to say  the sight of them amazes me  i never saw two people so alike as this boy and telemachus  the son of spirited odysseus  the child he left behind  a little newborn baby  the day the greeks marched off to troy  their minds fixated on the war and violence 
850,they made my face the because that hounded them 
851,high colored menelaus answered  wife  i saw the likeness too 
852,odysseus
853,had hands like those  those legs  that hair  that head  that glancing gaze 
854,and when i spoke just now about odysseus and all the things he suffered for my sake  the boy grimaced  and floods of tears were rolling down his cheeks  he raised his purple cloak to hide his eyes 
855,pisistratus  the son of nestor  spoke 
856,king menelaus  you are right 
857,this is that warrior s true born son  just as you said 
858,but he is shy and feels he should not speak
859,too boldly in your presence right away 
860,your voice is like a god s to us 
861,lord nestor sent me to guide him here 
862,he longed to see you to get some news from you or some advice 
863,a son whose father is away will suffer intensely  if he has no man at home to help him 
864,in the absence of his father  telemachus has no one to protect him 
865,then menelaus answered  so the son of my dear friend  who worked so hard for me 
866,has come here to my house  i always thought that i would greet that friend with warmth beyond all other argives  if zeus let us sail home with all speed across the sea 
867,i would have brought him from ithaca  with all his wealth  his son and people  and bestowed on him a town in argos  driving out the natives from somewhere hereabouts under my rule 
868,we would have constantly spent time together 
869,nothing would have divided us in love
870,and joy  till death s dark cloud surrounded us 
871,but i suppose the god begrudged our friendship  and kept that poor  unlucky man from home 
872,his words made everybody want to cry 
873,helen was weeping  as was menelaus 
874,pisistratus eyes were full of tears for irreplaceable antilochus  killed by the noble son of shining dawn 
875,mindful of him  he spoke with words like wings 
876,king menelaus  when we spoke of you
877,back home in our own halls  my father nestor always declared you are exceptional for common sense 
878,so listen now to me  i disapprove of crying during dinner 
879,dawn will soon come  weep then 
880,there is no harm in mourning when a person dies  it is the only honor we can pay the dead to cut our hair and drench our cheeks with tears 
881,i had a brother named antilochus  one of the bravest fighters in the army 
882,a sprinter and a warrior 
883,he died 
884,i never got to meet him or to see him 
885,perhaps you did 
886,king menelaus answered  my friend  you speak just as a wise man should  like somebody much older than yourself 
887,you show your father s wisdom in your speech 
888,a lineage is easy to discern when zeus spins out a life of happiness  in marriage and in offspring 
889,so he gave good luck to nestor all his life  he aged
890,at home in comfort  and his sons are wise and skillful spear men 
891,yes  we will stop crying and turn our minds to dinner once again 
892,let them pour water on our hands 
893,at dawn  telemachus and i can talk at length 
894,at that asphalion  the nimble house slave of mighty menelaus  poured the water over their hands 
895,they helped themselves to food from laden tables 
896,then the child of zeus  helen  decided she would mix the wine
897,with drugs to take all pain and rage away  to bring forgetfulness of every evil 
898,whoever drinks this mixture from the bowl will she would no tears that day  not even if her mother or her father die  nor even if soldiers kill her brother or her darling son with bronze spears before her very eyes 
899,helen had these powerful magic drugs from polydamna  wife of thon  from egypt  where fertile fields produce the most narcotics 
900,some good  some dangerous 
901,the people there are skillful doctors 
902,they are the healer s people 
903,she mixed the wine and told the slave to pour it  and then she spoke again 
904,now menelaus  and you two noble sons of noble men  zeus gives us good and bad at different times  he has the power 
905,sit here then and eat  and i will entertain you with a story 
906,enjoy it  it is fitting to the times 
907,i cannot tell of all the challenges
908,steadfast odysseus has undergone 
909,but i will tell you what that brave man did at troy  when the achaeans were in trouble 
910,he beat himself and bruised his body badly and put a ragged cloak on  like a slave  then shuffled through the enemy city streets 
911,in his disguise he seemed a poor old beggar  hardly a man to sail with the achaeans 
912,he crept through troy like that  and no one knew him except for me  i saw through his disguise
913,and questioned him 
914,he was too smart to talk  acting evasive 
915,but i washed and scrubbed him with oil and dressed him  and i swore an oath that i would not reveal him to the trojans before he had got back to his own camp 
916,he told me all the things the greeks were planning 
917,on his way back  he used his long bronze sword to slaughter many trojans  and he brought useful intelligence to tell the greeks 
918,the trojan women keened in grief  but i
919,was glad by then i wanted to go home 
920,i wished that aphrodite had not made me go crazy  when she took me from my country  and made me leave my daughter and the bed i shared with my fine  handsome  clever husband 
921,and menelaus said  yes  wife  quite right 
922,i have been round the world  and i have met many heroic men and known their minds 
923,i never saw a man so resolute as that odysseus 
924,how tough he was 
925,and what impressive fortitude he showed inside the wooden horse  we fighters lurked inside  to bring destruction to the trojans 
926,you came there too 
927,some spirit who desired to glorify the trojans urged you on 
928,godlike deiphobus was following you 
929,three times you went around the hollow belly  touching the hiding place  and calling on us greeks by name  you put on different voices for each man s wife 
930,then i and diomedes
931,and good odysseus  inside the horse  heard you call out to us  and we two wanted to go out  or to answer from in there 
932,odysseus prevented us from going 
933,then all the other sons of the achaeans were quiet  anticlus still wished to answer 
934,odysseus hands clamped shut his mouth and saved us all 
935,he held him there like that  until athena led you far away 
936,weighing these words  telemachus replied 
937,but menelaus  all this makes it worse  my father s courage could not save his life  even if he had had a heart of iron 
938,so now  show us to bed 
939,we need the comfort of being lulled into a sweet deep sleep 
940,then argive helen told her girls to spread beds on the porch and pile on them fine rugs of purple  and lay blankets over them  with woolly covers on the very top 
941,the girls went out with torches in their hands
942,and made the beds 
943,a slave led out the guests 
944,telemachus and nestor s handsome son slept in the front room  menelaus slept far back inside the lofty house 
945,beside him lay marvelous helen  in her flowing gown 
946,soon dawn was born  her fingers bright with roses 
947,gruff menelaus jumped up out of bed  got dressed and strapped his sharp sword to his shoulder  then tied his sandals on his well oiled feet 
948,he went out of his bedroom like a god 
949,approached telemachus  and spoke to him 
950,what need has brought you here  telemachus  to sparta  over such expanse of sea 
951,private or public business 
952,tell me truly  telemachus inhaled and then replied  king menelaus  son of atreus  i came in search of news about my father 
953,my house is being eaten up  our wealth is ruined 
954,my whole home is full of men who mean me harm my mother s loutish suitors 
955,each day they kill more sheep  more longhorn cattle 
956,so i am begging you  here on my knees  tell me the dreadful news  if he is dead  perhaps you saw it with your eyes  or heard tales of his travels 
957,he was surely born to suffer in extraordinary ways 
958,please do not try to sweeten bitter news from pity  tell me truly if you saw him  and how he was 
959,if my heroic father ever helped you at troy when things were bad 
960,keep that in mind right now  and tell the truth 
961,flushed  menelaus shouted out in anger  damn them  those cowards want to steal the bed of one whose heart is braver than their own 
962,as when a deer lays down two newborn fawns  still sucklings  in the lair of some strong lion  and goes to look for pasture  over slopes and grassy valleys  when the lion comes back to his own bed  he brings down doom on them so will odysseus upon those men 
963,o father zeus  athena  and apollo  i pray he is as strong as when he stood to wrestle philomeleides  on lesbos  and hurled him to the ground  and we all cheered 
964,so may odysseus attack the suitors 
965,may all their lives be brief  their weddings cursed  as for your questions  i will not deceive you 
966,i will not hide a single word i heard from that old sea god proteus 
967,although i longed to come back home  away from egypt 
968,the gods prevented me  since i had failed to offer perfect hecatombs 
969,they always desire obedience 
970,there is an island out in the sea beside the coast of egypt  named pharos 
971,if a clear wind blows your ship  it takes all day to travel to that island 
972,its harbor has good anchorage  and there men draw dark water up  and then launch off to sea 
973,but i was held for twenty days by gods 
974,no winds appeared to guide my ships
975,across the water s back 
976,all our supplies would have been gone  and all our hope  but then a goddess  eidothea  pitied me the child of proteus  the old sea god 
977,she met me pacing sadly all alone 
978,my men were off around the island  fishing with hooks  as usual hunger pinched their bellies 
979,she stood beside me and she spoke to me  stranger  are you so foolish that you choose to give up  and take pleasure in your pain 
980,there is no end in sight  you have been stuck here on this island for so long 
981,your men grow weak at heart 
982,i answered her and said  whoever you may be for sure a goddess i tell you i am trapped against my will 
983,i must have sinned against the deathless gods who live in heaven 
984,please explain which spirit is blocking me from going home across the teeming sea 
985,gods must know everything 
986,that shining goddess answered me at once 
987,stranger  i will be frank with you 
988,a deathless old sea god haunts this place  named proteus of egypt  who can speak infallibly  who knows the depths of seas  and serves poseidon 
989,they say he is the one who fathered me  if you can somehow lie in wait and catch him  he will explain how you can get back home  plotting your path where fish leap through the waters 
990,and if you wish it  prince  he will explain what happened in your home  both good and bad 
991,while you were gone on this long  painful journey 
992,those were her words 
993,i answered  tell me  please  how i can trap this ancient god  so he will not see me too soon  and get away 
994,it is not easy for a man to catch a god 
995,the goddess answered me at once  stranger  i will instruct you thoroughly 
996,when the sun hits the midpoint of the sky  the old god bobs above the salty water  the breath of zephyr hides him in dark shade 
997,he goes to take his nap inside the caves 
998,around him sleep the clustering seals  the daughters of lovely lady brine 
999,their breath smells sour from gray seawater  pungent salty depths 
1000,select the three best men you have on board  and when dawn breaks  i will take all of you down to the shore  and set you in a line 
1001,let me explain the old god s tricks 
1002,he will first count the seals and walk around among them 
1003,when he has counted them and checked them all 
1004,he lies down in the middle  like a shepherd among his flock of sheep 
1005,when you observe him sleeping  gather all your force and strength  and hold him there  despite his desperate struggles 
1006,in trying to escape  he will change shape to every animal on earth  and then water and holy fire 
1007,you must hold fast unshaken  and press harder  keep him down 
1008,at last he will assume again the form in which he went to sleep  and he will speak
1009,and question you 
1010,then  warrior  release your forceful hold on that old god  and ask him which god is angry with you  and the way to cross the fish filled waters and go home 
1011,with that she sank beneath the deep sea waves 
1012,i went down to the ships upon the sand 
1013,my heart was surging in me as i walked 
1014,arriving at the ships and at the shore  we made our meal 
1015,then came immortal night  we went to sleep beside the water s edge 
1016,when dawn appeared  her fingers bright with flowers  i walked beside the spreading sea  along the dunes  and prayed intensely to the gods 
1017,then i chose out my three most trusted men 
1018,the goddess dove down deep inside the sea and brought four sealskins up from underwater  new flayed to help her plot against her father 
1019,she scooped out hiding places in the sand  and sat to wait 
1020,we came right up to her 
1021,she laid us in a row  and put a skin
1022,on each 
1023,it would have been a dismal hideout  stinking of salt bred seals 
1024,who would lie down to rest beside a creature from the sea 
1025,but she brought sweet ambrosia to save us 
1026,she very kindly put it in our nostrils  to take away the stench of seal 
1027,we waited all morning  apprehensively 
1028,and then out of the sea there rose a pod of seals  they lay along the shore 
1029,at noon the god emerged above the waves 
1030,he went among
1031,his fatted seals and counted out their number 
1032,he counted us among the first of them  suspecting nothing 
1033,then he lay down too 
1034,with a great shout we pounced on him and grabbed him 
1035,the old god still remembered all his tricks  and first became a lion with a mane  then snake  then leopard  then a mighty boar  then flowing water  then a leafy tree 
1036,but we kept holding on  our hearts stood firm 
1037,at last that ancient sorcerer grew tired 
1038,and then he asked me  son of atreus  what god devised this plan with you and taught you to lurk and capture me against my will 
1039,what do you want from me 
1040,and i replied  old god  why do you want to throw me off 
1041,you know i have been trapped here on this island for far too long  with no way out  my heart grows faint 
1042,so tell me gods know everything what spirit stops my journey 
1043,and how can i get home across the watery shoals of fish 
1044,at once he answered me and told me this  you should have given zeus and other gods fine offerings  to speed your journey home across the wine dark sea 
1045,it is your fate not to go home or see the ones you love until you go again to egypt s river  watered by zeus  and kill a hundred cows  to please the deathless gods who live in heaven 
1046,then they will let you travel where you wish 
1047,i felt heartbroken that i had to cross
1048,the misty sea and go again to egypt  a long and bitter journey  but i answered  sir  i will do exactly as you say 
1049,but come now  tell me this  and tell me truly  did all the greeks sail safely home by ship  whom nestor and myself left there in troy 
1050,did any meet a dreadful death at sea  on his own ship  or in familiar arms  after the war wound up 
1051,when i said this  at once he answered me and said these words 
1052,o son of atreus  why ask me this 
1053,you have no need to know or learn my mind 
1054,when i have told you  you will not be long able to hold back tears 
1055,so many men were killed  and many left behind at troy 
1056,just two of all the bronze clad captains died while traveling back home  one more perhaps may be alive  trapped somewhere out at sea 
1057,ajax was drowned  his ships were sunk 
1058,poseidon first drove him to the rocks of gyrae  then
1059,rescued him from the sea  he would have lived  despite athena s hatred  but he made a crazy boast that he survived the waves against the wishes of the gods 
1060,poseidon heard his rash words 
1061,at once  he seized his trident in mighty hands  and hit the gyran rock 
1062,one half remained  the other  on which ajax sat as he boasted  cracked right off and fell into the sea  and carried him deep down 
1063,the boundless waves washed over him  he drank
1064,the salty brine  and died 
1065,but agamemnon survived the goddess hera saved his fleet 
1066,when he had almost reached the craggy mountain of malea  a gust of wind took hold and bore him over waves where fish were jumping  across the rumbling depths to where all farms are finished  where thyestes used to live  and now his son aegisthus 
1067,after that  the route was clear  the gods made all winds fair 
1068,then joyfully he stepped foot in his country 
1069,and touched and kissed the earth of his dear home 
1070,he wept hot floods of tears  from happiness 
1071,but from the lookout post the watchman saw him 
1072,scheming aegisthus paid that man two talents of gold to watch all year  so agamemnon could not slip past unseen  or summon up his will to fight 
1073,the spy rushed off to tell the king 
1074,aegisthus formed a plan at once 
1075,he chose the twenty best men in the land to lurk in ambush  and he told the house slaves
1076,to cook a feast 
1077,he rode out on his carriage  and summoned agamemnon  who suspected nothing 
1078,aegisthus killed him over dinner  just as a person kills an ox at manger 
1079,all of the men who came with him were killed  and all those of aegisthus  all were killed 
1080,his story broke my heart  and i sat down upon the sands and wept 
1081,i did not want to go on living or to see the sun 
1082,i thrashed around and wailed 
1083,when i was done 
1084,the old sea god spoke words of truth to me  now  son of atreus  your endless weeping has gone on long enough 
1085,it does no good 
1086,quickly  go home 
1087,you may still find aegisthus alive  or else orestes may have come and killed him  you can join his funeral 
1088,those words made me a man again  my heart was warmed inside  despite my grief 
1089,my words took wings 
1090,i said  i know now of those two  but name the third who may be still alive 
1091,trapped somewhere in the wide expanse of sea  or may be dead 
1092,i know the news may hurt  but still i want to hear it 
1093,and he answered  it is laertes son  the ithacan 
1094,i saw him crying  shedding floods of tears upon calypso s island  in her chambers 
1095,she traps him there  he cannot go back home 
1096,he has no boats with oars or crew to row him across the sea s broad back to his own land 
1097,but menelaus  it is not your fate
1098,to die in argos 
1099,gods will carry you off to the world s end  to elysium 
1100,those fields are ruled by tawny rhadamanthus and life is there the easiest for humans 
1101,there is no snow  no heavy storms or rain  but ocean always sends up gentle breezes of zephyr to refresh the people there 
1102,you gain these blessings as the son in law of zeus through helen 
1103,then the old god sank beneath the waves 
1104,i went back to my ships
1105,and godlike men  and as i walked my mind swirled with my many thoughts 
1106,beside the fleet we cooked and ate our meal  then holy night came down  we slept beside the surging water 
1107,when early dawn appeared and touched the sky with blossom  first we launched the balanced ships into the salty sea  put up the masts and fixed the sails  and then the men embarked and sat on benches neatly  in their lines 
1108,and then at once they struck the sea with oars 
1109,we soon reached egypt s holy rain fed river 
1110,we docked the ships and sacrificed the oxen 
1111,when i had quenched the anger of the gods  i built a mound to honor agamemnon  for his immortal fame 
1112,the gods at last gave me fair wind  and sent me quickly home 
1113,but come now  stay with me here in my palace  until eleven days or twelve have passed 
1114,then i will send you off with precious gifts  three horses and a gleaming chariot 
1115,also a lovely cup so you can pour gifts to the gods  and always think of me  then tactfully telemachus replied  please do not keep me here so long  my lord 
1116,indeed  i would be glad to stay a year  i would not even miss my home or parents i get such pleasure listening to you 
1117,but my poor friends are surely tired of waiting in pylos 
1118,you have made me stay too long 
1119,and for a gift  please only give me treasure 
1120,you keep your lovely horses here  i cannot transport them all the way to ithaca 
1121,you rule these open meadows  rich in clover  white barley in wide rows  and wheat and grass 
1122,in ithaca  there are no fields or racetracks 
1123,though it is only fit for goats  we love it more than horse pasture 
1124,islands out at sea have no good grazing ours the least of all 
1125,then menelaus smiled and clasped his hand  and spoke to him in his loud booming voice 
1126,my boy  your words are proof of your good blood 
1127,i will give different gifts  just as you ask 
1128,i will give you the finest piece of treasure of all the hoard i have piled up at home  a finely crafted bowl  of purest silver  with gold around the rim 
1129,hephaestus made it  and phaedimus the king of sidon gave it to me  when i was visiting his house as i was traveling home 
1130,you can have that 
1131,such was their conversation 
1132,then the guests
1133,entered the palace  bringing lamb and wine that gives one confidence 
1134,the girls  all dressed in pretty scarves  brought bread for them 
1135,so went the feasting in the house of menelaus 
1136,meanwhile  outside odysseus house  the suitors were as arrogant as usual  enjoying throwing discuses and spears out on the playing field 
1137,the two chief suitors  were sitting there  antinous and godlike eurymachus 
1138,just then no mon  son
1139,of phronius  approached and asked a question 
1140,so do we know  antinous  or not  whether telemachus is coming back from sandy pylos 
1141,he left with my ship 
1142,i need it  to cross over to the fields of elis  where i have twelve mares with mules suckling their teats and not yet broken in 
1143,i want to take and train one 
1144,they were all astonished  since they had not thought the boy was gone to pylos  but was somewhere near 
1145,out with the sheep or pigs 
1146,antinous said  tell me true  when did he go 
1147,and who went with him 
1148,did he choose some ithacans  or slaves and laborers 
1149,it could be either 
1150,and tell me also  did he steal the ship from you by force  or did you give it to him freely  because he asked 
1151,no mon  son of phronius  replied  i gave it freely 
1152,what could i do  when someone so upset was asking me 
1153,a noble boy like that 
1154,it would have been ungracious to refuse 
1155,the young men who were with him were high class  the best in town except ourselves 
1156,i saw mentor embark as captain or perhaps not mentor but a god who looked like him 
1157,this puzzles me  that yesterday at dawn i saw great mentor here  though he had gone to pylos in the ship 
1158,with that  no mon departed for his father s house 
1159,those leaders were furious 
1160,at once they made the suitors
1161,stop playing games and sit 
1162,antinous spoke up with eyes bright as fire  his mind darkened with anger 
1163,damn  that stuck up boy succeeded in his stupid trip 
1164,we thought he would not manage it 
1165,telemachus has launched a ship and picked an ideal crew  despite us all  this is the start of worse 
1166,may zeus destroy his strength before he reaches manhood 
1167,give me a ship and twenty men  so i may watch and catch him in the strait
1168,in between ithaca and craggy same 
1169,a sad end to this journey for his father  all of them praised his words  endorsed his plan  and went inside odysseus palace 
1170,penelope was soon aware of all the suitors secret plots 
1171,the house boy medon told her  since he had been outside the courtyard and he had heard the plans they were devising 
1172,he rushed to tell her 
1173,as he stepped inside  across the threshold  she came up and asked him 
1174,well  boy  why have those lordly suitors sent you 
1175,to tell godlike odysseus girls to stop their work and make a feast for them 
1176,i hope this is their final meal  i hope they never gather elsewhere to go courting  you suitors who come crowding here are wasting telemachus wealth  when you were younger you never paid attention to your fathers who told you of odysseus greatness 
1177,he never spoke or acted without justice 
1178,among the people 
1179,lords are mostly biased  they favor one person and hate another 
1180,but he did not 
1181,he did no wrong at all 
1182,now you  your wicked deeds and plans are clear 
1183,no gratitude for favors from the past  then knowledgeable medon answered her  my queen  i wish this were the worst of it 
1184,now they are plotting even greater ruin 
1185,may zeus ensure it never comes to pass  the suitors want to kill telemachus
1186,with sharp bronze weapons on his journey home 
1187,he went to sandy pylos and to sparta for word about his father 
1188,at the news  her legs grew weak  her heart sank  she was struck dumb for a time  her voice blocked as her eyes filled up with tears 
1189,at last she answered him  but why did my son go away 
1190,there was no need to go on those swift ships that gallop like horses over miles of salty water 
1191,did he intend to lose his name as well 
1192,and be unknown 
1193,and medon said  perhaps some god or his own heart nudged him to go to pylos to find out about his father  if he will come back home  or if he has already met his fate 
1194,with that  he left her 
1195,grief wrapped around her  eating at her heart 
1196,the house was full of chairs but she could not bear to sit upright 
1197,in her bedroom doorway  collapsing on the floor  she wept and cried 
1198,around her all her women  young and old 
1199,were whimpering 
1200,voice thick with tears  she sobbed  friends  listen  zeus has cursed me more than all the women of my family 
1201,already i lost my noble  lionhearted husband  most talented and brave of all the greeks  whose fame is spread through greece 
1202,and now the winds have taken my dear son  and no one told me that he was setting out 
1203,shame on you all  you knew that he was leaving in that ship  not one of you came here to wake me up 
1204,if only i had known about his journey  he would have stayed no matter how he wanted to leave or else have left me dead right here 
1205,now call old dolius  my gardener  the slave who cares for all my trees 
1206,my father gave him to me when i came here 
1207,tell him to hurry off and sit beside laertes  and tell him everything  he may decide to go in tears to plead with those who want to kill godlike odysseus son 
1208,his grandson 
1209,then the loyal eurycleia said  lady  sweetheart  even if you take a sword and kill me  i will tell the truth 
1210,i knew all this 
1211,i gave him what he asked for  bread and sweet wine 
1212,he made me swear an oath not to inform you  till twelve days had passed  or till you heard about it  and you missed him  so that you would not cry and spoil your beauty 
1213,now have a bath  get changed into clean clothes  go with your slave girls upstairs to your room 
1214,pray to athena  child of zeus the king 
1215,she may save him from death 
1216,and do not bother poor old laertes  he has pain enough 
1217,i do not think the blessed gods despise this family  i trust that there will always be one to rule this house and rich estate 
1218,this soothed penelope 
1219,she dried her tears  and took her bath and got dressed in clean clothes  then went up to her bedroom with her girls 
1220,she put some barley on a tray and prayed 
1221,hear me  athena  tireless child of zeus  if my quick minded husband ever gave you fat thighs of beef or lamb here in our halls  remember now and save the son i love 
1222,protect him from the abuses of those suitors  she wailed aloud  the goddess heard her prayer 
1223,the suitors made a racket that resounded all through the palace shadows 
1224,they were boasting  this queen whom all of us have come here courting is ready now to marry one of us 
1225,and does not even know her son will die  they spoke not knowing how things really stood 
1226,antinous declared to them  my lords  you have to stop this bragging  quiet down  or those inside will hear it 
1227,now get up in silence 
1228,we must go and follow through the plan we all agreed on in our hearts 
1229,with that  he picked the twenty strongest men 
1230,they went down to the seashore  first of all they launched the swift black ship in deep saltwater 
1231,set up the mast and raised the sails and fit the oars in proper order in the straps of leather  then spread out the bright white sails 
1232,with confidence their slaves dealt out the weapons 
1233,they moored high up the stream and disembarked 
1234,they ate there  while they waited for the evening 
1235,penelope lay upstairs in her bedroom  refusing food and drink  consuming nothing 
1236,she wondered if her fine son would escape from death  or be brought down by those proud suitors 
1237,her mind was like a lion  caught by humans  when they are clustering round him in a circle  trying to trap him  so sweet drowsiness subdued her and she slept  her limbs relaxed 
1238,athena  bright eyed goddess  had a plan 
1239,she made a phantom looking like a woman  iphthime  child of great icarius  the wife of eumelus who lived in pherae 
1240,she sent it to odysseus house  to make penelope feel less distressed
1241,and stop her tears of grief 
1242,it traveled through the latch s thong  and in her bedroom stood above her head  and asked  penelope  are you asleep 
1243,and are you still upset 
1244,the gods who live at ease have no desire for you to weep or worry 
1245,know  your son is coming home 
1246,he has not wronged the gods 
1247,intelligent penelope  still sleeping sweetly inside the gates of dreams  replied  sister  why have you come 
1248,your house is far 
1249,and you have never visited before 
1250,you tell me to stop grieving and not feel the many pains that prickle at my heart 
1251,but long ago i lost my lionhearted husband  a man more talented than any  famous throughout all greece 
1252,now my dear son has sailed off in a ship  though he knows nothing of hardship and the world  he is a child 
1253,i worry for him more than for his father 
1254,i shudder  i am scared of what may happen 
1255,at sea  or in the country that he went to 
1256,he has so many enemies  they plan to murder him before he reaches home 
1257,the misty phantom answered her  have courage 
1258,let not your heart be troubled or afraid 
1259,he has a goddess as his guide athena  a helper many men have prayed to have 
1260,she has great power 
1261,pitying your grief  she sent me here to tell you all of this 
1262,careful penelope replied  if you
1263,are actually a god  with news from gods  tell me about my husband too  poor man  tell if he is alive and sees the sun  or dead already in the house of hades  the spirit said  i cannot tell you whether he is alive or dead 
1264,it is not good to speak of things intangible as wind 
1265,with that  the phantom floated through the air into the breeze 
1266,and then penelope woke up from sleep  and she was glad at heart 
1267,because she dreamed so clearly in the night 
1268,the suitors got on board and sailed across the water  set on murdering the boy 
1269,there is a rocky island out at sea  in between ithaca and craggy same  called asteris quite small but with a harbor to shelter ships  and there they lurked in ambush 
1270,from the goddess to the storm then dawn rose up from bed with lord tithonus  to bring the light to deathless gods and mortals 
1271,the gods sat down for council  with the great thunderlord zeus 
1272,athena was concerned about odysseus many troubles  trapped by the nymph calypso in her house 
1273,father  and all immortal gods  she said  no longer let a sceptered king be kind  or gentle  or pay heed to right and wrong 
1274,let every king be cruel  his acts unjust 
1275,odysseus ruled gently  like a father  but no one even thinks about him now 
1276,the wretched man is stranded on an island  calypso forces him to stay with her 
1277,he cannot make his way back to his country 
1278,he has no ships  no oars  and no companions to help him sail across the wide backed sea 
1279,his son has gone for news of his lost father  in sandy pylos and in splendid sparta  they plot to kill the boy when he returns 
1280,smiling at her  lord zeus who heaps the clouds replied  ah  daughter  what a thing to say  did you not plan all this yourself  so that odysseus could come and take revenge upon those suitors 
1281,now use all your skill  ensure telemachus comes safely home  and that the suitors fail and sail away 
1282,then turning to his son he said  dear hermes  you are my messenger 
1283,go tell the goddess our fixed intention  that odysseus
1284,must go back home he has endured enough 
1285,without a god or human as his guide  he will drift miserably for twenty days upon a makeshift raft  and then arrive at fertile scheria 
1286,the magical phaeacians will respect him like a god  and send him in a ship to his dear homeland  with gifts of bronze and heaps of gold and clothing  more than he would have brought with him from troy if he had come directly  with his share
1287,of plunder 
1288,it is granted him to see the ones he loves  beneath his own high roof  in his own country 
1289,hermes heard these words 
1290,at once he fastened on his feet the sandals of everlasting gold with which he flies on breath of air across the sea and land  he seized the wand he uses to enchant men s eyes to sleep or wake as he desires  and flew 
1291,the god flashed bright in all his power 
1292,he touched pieria  then from the sky
1293,he plunged into the sea and swooped between the waves  just like a seagull catching fish  wetting its whirring wings in tireless brine 
1294,so hermes scudded through the surging swell 
1295,then finally  he reached the distant island  stepped from the indigo water to the shore  and reached the cavern where the goddess lived 
1296,there sat calypso with her braided curls 
1297,beside the hearth a mighty fire was burning 
1298,the scent of citrus and of brittle pine
1299,suffused the island 
1300,inside  she was singing and weaving with a shuttle made of gold 
1301,her voice was beautiful 
1302,around the cave a luscious forest flourished  alder  poplar  and scented cypress 
1303,it was full of wings 
1304,birds nested there but hunted out at sea  the owls  the hawks  the gulls with gaping beaks 
1305,a ripe and luscious vine  hung thick with grapes  was stretched to coil around her cave 
1306,four springs spurted with sparkling water as they laced
1307,with crisscross currents intertwined together 
1308,the meadow softly bloomed with celery and violets 
1309,he gazed around in wonder and joy  at sights to please even a god 
1310,even the deathless god who once killed argos stood still  his heart amazed at all he saw 
1311,at last he went inside the cave 
1312,calypso  the splendid goddess  knew the god on sight  the deathless gods all recognize each other  however far away their homes may be 
1313,but hermes did not find odysseus  since he was sitting by the shore as usual  sobbing in grief and pain  his heart was breaking 
1314,in tears he stared across the fruitless sea 
1315,divine calypso told her guest to sit upon a gleaming  glittering chair  and said  dear friend  lord hermes of the golden wand  why have you come 
1316,you do not often visit 
1317,what do you have in mind 
1318,my heart inclines to help you if i can  if it is fated 
1319,for now  come in  and let me make you welcome 
1320,at that the goddess led him to a table heaped with ambrosia  and she mixed a drink  red nectar 
1321,so mercurial hermes drank and ate till he was satisfied  and then the diplomat explained why he had come 
1322,you are a goddess  i a god and yet you ask why i am here 
1323,well  i will tell you 
1324,zeus ordered me to come i did not want to 
1325,who would desire to cross such an expanse
1326,of endless salty sea 
1327,no human town is near here  where gods get fine sacrifices 
1328,still  none can sway or check the will of zeus 
1329,he says the most unhappy man alive is living here a warrior from those who fought the town of priam for nine years and in the tenth they sacked it and sailed home 
1330,but on the journey back  they wronged athena 
1331,she roused the wind and surging sea against them and all his brave companions were destroyed 
1332,while he himself was blown here by the waves 
1333,zeus orders you to send him on his way at once  since it is not his destiny to die here far away from those he loves 
1334,it is his fate to see his family and come back home  to his own native land 
1335,calypso shuddered and let fly at him 
1336,you cruel  jealous gods  you bear a grudge whenever any goddess takes a man to sleep with as a lover in her bed 
1337,just so the gods who live at ease were angry when rosy fingered dawn took up orion  and from her golden throne  chaste artemis attacked and killed him with her gentle arrows 
1338,demeter with the cornrows in her hair indulged her own desire  and she made love with iasion in triple furrowed fields till zeus found out  hurled flashing flame and killed him 
1339,so now  you male gods are upset with me for living with a man  a man i saved 
1340,zeus pinned his ship and with his flash of lightning smashed it to pieces 
1341,all his friends were killed out on the wine dark sea 
1342,this man alone  clutching the keel  was swept by wind and wave  and came here  to my home 
1343,i cared for him and loved him  and i vowed to set him free from time and death forever 
1344,still  i know no other god can change the will of zeus 
1345,so let him go  if that is zeus order  across the barren sea 
1346,i will not give
1347,an escort for this trip across the water  i have no ships or rowers 
1348,but i will share what i know with him  and gladly give useful advice so he can safely reach his home 
1349,the mediator  zeus servant  replied  then send him now  avoid the wrath of zeus  do not enrage him  or one day his rage will hurt you 
1350,with these words  he vanished 
1351,acknowledging the edict sent from zeus  the goddess went to find odysseus 
1352,she found him on the shore 
1353,his eyes were always tearful  he wept sweet life away  in longing to go back home  since she no longer pleased him 
1354,he had no choice 
1355,he spent his nights with her inside her hollow cave  not wanting her though she still wanted him 
1356,by day he sat out on the rocky beach  in tears and grief  staring in heartbreak at the fruitless sea 
1357,the goddess stood by him and said  poor man  stop grieving  please 
1358,you need not waste your life 
1359,i am quite ready now to send you off 
1360,using your sword of bronze  cut trunks and build a raft  fix decks across  and let it take you across the misty sea 
1361,i will provide water  red wine  and food  to stop you starving  and i will give you clothes  and send a wind to blow you safely home  if this is what those sky gods want 
1362,they are more powerful than me  they get their way 
1363,odysseus  informed by many years of pain and loss 
1364,shuddered and let his words fly out at her 
1365,goddess  you have some other scheme in mind  not my safe passage 
1366,you are telling me to cross this vast and terrifying gulf  in just a raft  when even stable schooners sped on by winds from zeus would not succeed 
1367,no  goddess  i will not get on a raft  unless you swear to me a mighty oath you are not planning yet more pain for me  at that  divine calypso smiled at him 
1368,she reached out and caressed him with her hand  saying  you scalawag  what you have said shows that you understand how these things work 
1369,but by this earth  and by the sky above  and by the waters of the styx below  which is the strongest oath for blessed gods  i swear i will not plot more pain for you 
1370,i have made plans for you as i would do for my own self  if i were in your place 
1371,i am not made of iron  no  my heart
1372,is kind and decent  and i pity you 
1373,and with those words  the goddess quickly turned and led the way  he followed in her footsteps 
1374,they reached the cave together  man and goddess 
1375,the chair that hermes had been sitting on was empty now  odysseus sat there 
1376,the goddess gave him human food and drink 
1377,she sat and faced godlike odysseus while slave girls brought her nectar and ambrosia 
1378,they reached to take the good things set before them 
1379,and satisfied their hunger and their thirst 
1380,the goddess queen began 
1381,odysseus  son of laertes  blessed by zeus your plans are always changing 
1382,do you really want to go back to that home you love so much 
1383,well then  good bye  but if you understood how glutted you will be with suffering before you reach your home  you would stay here with me and be immortal though you might still wish to see that wife you always pine for 
1384,and anyway  i know my body is better than hers is  i am taller too 
1385,mortals can never rival the immortals in beauty 
1386,so odysseus  with tact  said do not be enraged at me  great goddess 
1387,you are quite right 
1388,i know my modest wife penelope could never match your beauty 
1389,she is a human  you are deathless  ageless 
1390,but even so  i want to go back home  and every day i hope that day will come 
1391,if some god strikes me on the wine dark sea  i will endure it 
1392,by now i am used to suffering i have gone through so much  at sea and in the war 
1393,let this come too 
1394,the sun went down and brought the darkness on 
1395,they went inside the hollow cave and took the pleasure of their love  held close together 
1396,when vernal dawn first touched the sky with flowers  they rose and dressed  odysseus put on his cloak and tunic  and calypso wore
1397,her fine long robe of silver 
1398,round her waist she wrapped a golden belt  and veiled her head 
1399,then she prepared the journey for the man  she gave an axe that fitted in his grip  its handle made of finest olive wood  its huge bronze blade was sharp on either side 
1400,she also gave a polished adze 
1401,she led him out to the island s end  where tall trees grew  black poplar  alder  fir that touched the sky  good for a nimble boat of seasoned timber 
1402,when she had shown him where the tall trees grew  calypso  queen of goddesses  went home 
1403,odysseus began and made good progress 
1404,with his bronze axe he cut down twenty trunks  polished them skillfully and planed them straight 
1405,calypso brought a gimlet and he drilled through every plank and fitted them together  fixing it firm with pegs and fastenings 
1406,as wide as when a man who knows his trade marks out the curving hull to fit a ship 
1407,so wide odysseus marked out his raft 
1408,he notched the side decks to the close set frame and fixed long planks along the ribs to finish 
1409,he set a mast inside  and joined to it a yardarm and a rudder to steer straight 
1410,he heaped the boat with brush  and caulked the sides with wickerwork  to keep the water out 
1411,calypso brought him fabric for a sail  and he constructed that with equal skill 
1412,he fastened up the braces  clews and halyards 
1413,and using levers  launched her on the sea 
1414,the work had taken four days  on the fifth calypso let him go 
1415,she washed and dressed him in clothes that smelled of incense 
1416,on the raft she put a flask of wine  a bigger flask of water  and a large supply of food 
1417,she sent him off with gentle  lukewarm breezes 
1418,gladly odysseus spread out his sails to catch the wind  with skill he steered the rudder 
1419,no sleep fell on his eyes  he watched the stars 
1420,the pleiades  late setting bo tes  and bear  which people also call the plow  which circles in one place  and marks orion the only star that has no share of ocean 
1421,calypso  queen of goddesses  had told him to keep the bear on his left side while sailing 
1422,he sailed the sea for seven days and ten  and on the eighteenth day  a murky mountain of the phaeacian land appeared it rose up like a shield beyond the misty sea 
1423,returning from the ethiopians  and pausing on mount solyma  poseidon  master of earthquakes  saw the distant raft 
1424,enraged  he shook his head and told himself  this is outrageous  so it seems the gods have changed their plans about odysseus while i was absent  he has almost reached phaeacia  where it is his destiny to flee the rope of pain that binds him now 
1425,but i will goad him to more misery 
1426,till he is sick of it 
1427,he gathered up the clouds  and seized his trident and stirred round the sea and roused the gusts of every wind  and covered earth and sea with fog 
1428,night stretched from heaven 
1429,eurus  notus  blasting zephyr and boreas  the child of sky  all fell and rolled a mighty wave 
1430,odysseus grew weak at knees 
1431,he cried out in despair  more pain 
1432,how will it end 
1433,i am afraid the goddess spoke the truth  that i will have
1434,a sea of sufferings before i reach my homeland 
1435,it is coming true  zeus whirls the air 
1436,look at those clouds  he agitates the waves  as winds attack from all directions 
1437,i can hold on to one thing  certain death 
1438,those greeks were lucky  three and four times over  who died upon the plain of troy to help the sons of atreus 
1439,i wish i had died that same day the mass of trojans hurled their bronze tipped spears at me around the corpse
1440,of peleus son 
1441,i would have had a funeral  and honor from the greeks  but now i have to die this cruel death  a wave crashed onto him  and overturned the raft  and he fell out 
1442,the rudder slipped out of his hands 
1443,the winds blew all directions and one enormous gust snapped off the mast 
1444,the sail and yardarm drifted out to sea 
1445,then for a long time rushing  crashing waves kept him submerged  he could not reach the surface 
1446,the clothes calypso gave him weighed him down 
1447,at last he rose and spat the sour saltwater out of his mouth it gushed forth in a torrent 
1448,despite his pain and weakness  he remembered his raft  and lunged to get it through the waves  he climbed on top of it and clung to life 
1449,the great waves carried it this way and that 
1450,as when the thistles  clumping close together  are borne across the prairie by the north wind  so these winds swept the raft across the sea 
1451,the south wind hurls it  then the north wind grabs it  then east wind yields and let us the west wind drive it 
1452,but stepping softly  ino  the white goddess  cadmus child  once human  human voiced  now honored with the gods in salty depths  noticed that he was suffering and lost  with pity 
1453,like a gull with wings outstretched she rose up from the sea  sat on the raft and said  poor man  why does enraged poseidon create an odyssey of pain for you 
1454,but his hostility will not destroy you 
1455,you seem intelligent 
1456,do as i say 
1457,strip off your clothes and leave the raft behind for winds to take away 
1458,with just your arms swim to phaeacia 
1459,fate decrees that there you will survive 
1460,here  take my scarf and tie it under your chest  with this immortal veil  you need not be afraid of death or danger 
1461,but when you reach dry earth  untie the scarf and throw it out to sea  away from land 
1462,and turn away 
1463,with that  the goddess gave it  and plunged back down inside the surging sea  just like a gull 
1464,the black wave covered her 
1465,the hero who had suffered so much danger was troubled and confused 
1466,he asked himself  some deity has said to leave the raft 
1467,but what if gods are weaving tricks again 
1468,i will not trust her yet  with my own eyes i saw the land she said i should escape to  and it is far away 
1469,i will do this 
1470,as long as these wood timbers hold together  i will hang on  however hard it is  but when the waves have smashed my raft to pieces  then i will have no choice  and i will swim 
1471,while he was thinking this  the lord of earthquakes  poseidon  roused a huge and dreadful wave that arched above his head  he hurled it at him 
1472,as when a fierce wind ruffles up a heap of dry wheat chaff  it scatters here and there  so were the raft s long timbers flung apart 
1473,he climbed astride a plank and rode along as if on horseback 
1474,he took off the clothes calypso gave him  but he tied the scarf around his chest  and dove into the sea  spreading his arms to swim 
1475,the lord of earthquakes saw him and nodded  muttering  at last you are in pain  go drift across the sea  till you meet people blessed by zeus  the sky lord 
1476,but even then  i think you will not lack for suffering 
1477,he spurred his fine maned horses 
1478,and went to aegae  where he had his home 
1479,athena  child of zeus  devised a plan 
1480,she blocked the path of all the other winds  told them to cease and made them go to sleep  but roused swift boreas and smoothed the waves in front of him  so that odysseus could reach phaeacia and escape from death 
1481,two days and nights he drifted on the waves  each moment he expected he would die 
1482,but when the dawn with dazzling braids brought day
1483,for the third time  the wind died down 
1484,no breeze  but total calm 
1485,as he was lifted up by an enormous wave  he scanned around  and saw the shore nearby 
1486,as when a father lies sick and weak for many days  tormented by some cruel spirit  till at last the gods restore him back to life  his children feel great joy  odysseus felt that same joy when he saw land 
1487,he swam and longed to set his feet on earth 
1488,but when he was in earshot 
1489,he heard the boom of surf against the rocks 
1490,the mighty waves were crashing on the shore  a dreadful belching 
1491,everything was covered in salty foam 
1492,there were no sheltering harbors for ships  just sheer crags  reefs and solid cliffs 
1493,odysseus heart and legs gave way 
1494,shaken but purposeful  he told himself  zeus went beyond my hopes and let me see dry land  i made it  cutting the abyss  but i see no way out from this gray sea 
1495,there are steep cliffs offshore  and all around the rushing water roars  the rock runs sheer  the sea is deep near shore  there is no way to set my feet on land without disaster 
1496,if i attempt to scramble out  a wave will seize and dash me on the jagged rock  a useless effort 
1497,but if i swim on farther  looking for bays or coves or slanting beaches  storm winds may seize me once again and drag me  howling with grief  towards the fish filled sea 
1498,a god may even send a great sea monster  the kind that famous amphitrite rears 
1499,i know poseidon wants to do me harm 
1500,as he was thinking this  the waves grew big and hurled him at the craggy shore 
1501,his skin would have been ripped away  and his bones smashed  had not athena given him a thought 
1502,he grabbed a rock as he was swept along with both hands  and clung to it  groaning  till the wave passed by 
1503,but then the swell rushed back 
1504,and struck him hard and hurled him out to sea 
1505,as when an octopus  dragged from its den  has many pebbles sticking to its suckers  so his strong hands were skinned against the rocks 
1506,a mighty wave rolled over him again 
1507,he would have died too soon  in misery  without the inspiration of athena 
1508,he came up from the wave that spewed to shore and swam towards the land  in search of beaches with gradual slopes  or inlets from the sea 
1509,he swam until he reached a river s mouth with gentle waters  that place seemed ideal  smooth and not stony  sheltered from the wind 
1510,he sensed its current  in his heart he prayed  unknown god  hear me  how i longed for you  i have escaped the salt sea and poseidon 
1511,even the deathless gods respect a man who is as lost as i am now 
1512,i have gone through so much and reached your flowing streams 
1513,pity me  lord  i am your supplicant 
1514,the current ceased  the river god restrained the waves and made them calm 
1515,he brought him safe into the river mouth 
1516,his legs cramped up  the sea had broken him 
1517,his swollen body gushed brine from mouth and nostrils 
1518,there he lay  winded and silent  hardly fit to move 
1519,a terrible exhaustion overcame him 
1520,when he could breathe and think again  he took the goddess scarf off  and let it go into the river flowing to the sea 
1521,strong currents swept it down and ino s hands took it 
1522,he crawled on land and crouched beside the reeds and bent to kiss life giving earth  and trembling  he spoke to his own heart 
1523,what now 
1524,what will become of me 
1525,if i stay up all wretched night beside this river  the cruel frost and gentle dew together may finish me  my life is thin with weakness 
1526,at dawn a cold breeze blows beside the river 
1527,but if i climb the slope to those dark woods
1528,and go to rest in that thick undergrowth  letting sweet sleep take hold of me  and losing my cold and weariness wild beasts may find me and treat me as their prey 
1529,but he decided to go into the woods 
1530,he found a place beside a clearing  near the water s edge 
1531,he crawled beneath two bushes grown together  of thorn and olive 
1532,no strong wet wind could blow through them  no shining sunbeam ever strike them  no rain could penetrate them  they were growing
1533,so thickly intertwined 
1534,odysseus crept under  and he scraped a bed together  of leaves  there were enough to cover two against the worst of winter 
1535,seeing this  the hero who had suffered for so long was happy 
1536,he lay down inside and heaped more leaves on top 
1537,as when a man who lives out on a lonely farm that has no neighbors buries a glowing torch inside black embers to save the seed of fire and keep a source
1538,so was odysseus concealed in leaves 
1539,athena poured down sleep to shut his eyes so all his painful weariness could end 
1540,a princess and her laundry odysseus had suffered 
1541,in exhaustion from all his long ordeals  the hero slept 
1542,meanwhile  athena went to the phaeacians 
1543,this people used to live in hyperia  a land of dancing 
1544,but their mighty neighbors  the cyclopes  kept looting them  and they could not hold out 
1545,their king  nausithous  brought them to scheria  a distant place  and built a wall around the town  and homes  and temples to the gods  and plots of land 
1546,he went to hades 
1547,then alcinous  who has god given wisdom  came to power 
1548,bright eyed athena traveled to his palace  to help odysseus journey home 
1549,she went inside the decorated bedroom where the young princess  nausicaa  was sleeping  as lovely as a goddess 
1550,slaves were sleeping outside her doorway  one on either side  two charming girls with all the graces gifts 
1551,the shining doors were shut  but like the wind
1552,the goddess reached the bed of nausicaa  disguised as her best friend  a girl her age  the daughter of the famous sailor dymas 
1553,sharp eyed athena said  oh  nausicaa  so lazy  but your mother should have taught you  your clothes are lying there in dirty heaps  though you will soon be married  and you need a pretty dress to wear  and clothes to give to all your bridesmaids 
1554,that impresses people  and makes the parents happy 
1555,when day comes 
1556,we have to do the laundry 
1557,i will come and help you  so the work will soon be done 
1558,surely you will not long remain unmarried 
1559,the best young men here in your native land already want to court you 
1560,so at dawn go ask your father for the cart with mules  to carry dresses  scarves  and sheets 
1561,you should ride there  not walk  the washing pools are far from town 
1562,the goddess looked into her eyes  then went back to olympus  which they say
1563,is where the gods will have their home forever 
1564,the place is never shaken by the wind  or wet with rain or blanketed by snow 
1565,a cloudless sky is spread above the mountain  white radiance all round 
1566,the blessed gods live there in happiness forevermore 
1567,then dawn came from her lovely throne  and woke the girl 
1568,she was amazed  remembering her dream  and in a fine dress  went to tell her parents  whom she found inside the hall 
1569,her mother sat beside the hearth and spun sea purpled yarn  her house girls all around her 
1570,her father was just heading out to council with his renowned advisors  since his people had called him to a meeting 
1571,she stood near him and said  dear daddy  please would you set up the wagon with the big smooth wheels for me  so i can take my fine clothes to the river to wash them 
1572,they are dirty 
1573,and you too should wear clean clothes for meeting your advisors 
1574,dressed in your best to make important plans 
1575,your five sons also two of whom are married  but three are strapping single men they always want to wear nice fresh laundered clothes when they are going dancing 
1576,this is on my mind 
1577,she said this since she felt too shy to talk of marriage to her father 
1578,but he knew  and answered  child  i would not grudge the mules or anything you want 
1579,go on  the slaves can fit the wagon with its cargo rack 
1580,he called the household slaves  and they obeyed 
1581,they made the wagon ready and inspected its wheels  led up the mules  and yoked them to it 
1582,the girl brought out the multicolored clothes  and put them on the cart  while in a basket her mother packed nutritious food for her a varied meal  with olives  cheese  and wine  stored in a goatskin 
1583,then the girl got in 
1584,her mother handed her a golden flask of oil  to use when she had had her bath 
1585,then nausicaa took up the whip and reins  and cracked the whip 
1586,the mules were on their way  eager to go and rattling the harness  bringing the clothes and girl and all her slaves 
1587,they reached the lovely river where the pools are always full the water flows in streams and bubbles up from underneath  to wash even the dirtiest of laundry 
1588,there they freed the mules and drove them to the river to graze on honeyed grass beside the stream 
1589,the girls brought out the laundry from the cart  and brought it to the washing pools and trod it  competing with each other 
1590,when the dirt was gone  they spread the clothes along the shore  where salt sea washes pebbles to the beach 
1591,they bathed and rubbed themselves with olive oil 
1592,then they sat on the riverbank and ate  and waited for the sun to dry the clothes 
1593,but when they finished eating  they took off their head scarves to play ball 
1594,the white armed princess
1595,led them in play like artemis the archer  running across the heights of taygetus and erymanthus  she is glad to run with boars and fleet foot deer 
1596,the rustic daughters of zeus the aegis king play round about her  while leto is delighted in her heart  seeing her daughter far above the rest  though all are beautiful 
1597,so nausicaa stood out above them all 
1598,but when the girl was thinking she should head for home and yoke
1599,the mules  and pack the laundry up again  athena s eyes flashed bright 
1600,odysseus must wake up  see the pretty girl  and have an escort to the town of the phaeacians 
1601,the princess threw the ball towards a slave girl  who missed the catch 
1602,it fell down in an eddy  the girls all started screaming  very loudly 
1603,odysseus woke up  and thought things over 
1604,what is this country i have come to now 
1605,are all the people wild and violent 
1606,or good  hospitable  and god fearing 
1607,i heard the sound of female voices 
1608,is it nymphs  who frequent the craggy mountaintops  and river streams and meadows lush with grass 
1609,or could this noise i hear be human voices 
1610,i have to try to find out who they are 
1611,odysseus jumped up from out the bushes 
1612,grasping a leafy branch he broke it off to cover up his manly private parts 
1613,just as a mountain lion trusts its strength 
1614,and beaten by the rain and wind  its eyes burn bright as it attacks the cows or sheep  or wild deer  and hunger drives it on to try the sturdy pens of sheep so need impelled odysseus to come upon the girls with pretty hair  though he was naked 
1615,all caked with salt  he looked a dreadful sight 
1616,they ran along the shore quite terrified  some here  some there 
1617,but nausicaa stayed still 
1618,athena made her legs stop trembling
1619,and gave her courage in her heart 
1620,she stood there 
1621,he wondered  should he touch her knees  or keep some distance and use charming words  to beg the pretty girl to show him to the town  and give him clothes 
1622,at last he thought it best to keep some distance and use words to beg her 
1623,the girl might be alarmed at being touched 
1624,his words were calculated flattery 
1625,my lady  please  are you divine or human 
1626,if you are some great goddess from the sky 
1627,you look like zeus daughter artemis you are as tall and beautiful as she 
1628,but if you live on earth and are a human  your mother and your father must be lucky  your brothers also lucky three times over 
1629,their hearts must be delighted  seeing you  their flourishing new sprout  the dancers leader 
1630,and that man will be luckiest by far  who takes you home with dowry  as his bride 
1631,i have seen no one like you 
1632,never  no one 
1633,my eyes are dazzled when i look at you 
1634,i traveled once to delos  on my way to war and suffering  my troops marched with me  beside apollo s altar sprang a sapling  a fresh young palm 
1635,i gazed at it and marveled 
1636,i never saw so magical a tree 
1637,my lady  you transfix me that same way 
1638,i am in awe of you  afraid to touch your knees 
1639,but i am desperate 
1640,i came from ogygia  and for twenty days storm winds
1641,and waves were driving me  adrift until yesterday some god washed me up right here  perhaps to meet more suffering 
1642,i think my troubles will not end until the gods have done their all 
1643,my lady  pity me  battered and wrecked  i come to you  you first and i know no one else in this whole country 
1644,show me the town  give me some rags to wear  if you brought any clothes when you came here 
1645,so may the gods grant all your heart s desires 
1646,a home and husband  somebody like minded 
1647,for nothing could be better than when two live in one house  their minds in harmony  husband and wife 
1648,their enemies are jealous  their friends delighted  and they have great honor 
1649,then white armed nausicaa replied  well  stranger  you seem a brave and clever man  you know that zeus apportions happiness to people  to good and bad  each one as he decides 
1650,your troubles come from him  and you must bear them 
1651,but since you have arrived here in our land  you will not lack for clothes or anything a person needs in times of desperation 
1652,i will show you the town 
1653,the people here are called phaeacians  and i am the daughter of the great king alcinous  on whom depends the strength and power of our people 
1654,and then she called her slaves with braided hair 
1655,wait  girls  why are you running from this man 
1656,do you believe he is an enemy 
1657,no living person ever born would come to our phaeacia with a hostile mind  since we are much beloved by the gods 
1658,our island is remote  washed round by sea  we have no human contact 
1659,but this man is lost  poor thing 
1660,we must look after him 
1661,all foreigners and beggars come from zeus  and any act of kindness is a blessing 
1662,so give the stranger food and drink  and wash him down in the river  sheltered from the wind 
1663,they stopped  and egged each other on to take odysseus to shelter  as the princess  the daughter of alcinous  had told them 
1664,they gave him clothes  a tunic and a cloak  the olive oil in the golden flask  and led him down to wash beside the river 
1665,odysseus politely said  now  girls  wait at a distance here  so i can wash my grimy back  and rub myself with oil it has been quite a while since i have done it 
1666,please let me wash in private 
1667,i am shy of being naked with you pretty girls with lovely hair 
1668,so they withdrew  and told their mistress 
1669,then he used the river water to scrub the brine off from his back and shoulders  and wash the crusty sea salt from his hair 
1670,but when he was all clean and richly oiled  dressed in the clothes the young unmarried girl had given him  athena made him look bigger and sturdier  and made his hair
1671,grow curling tendrils like a hyacinth 
1672,as when athena and hephaestus teach a knowledgeable craftsman every art  and he pours gold on silver  making objects more beautiful just so athena poured attractiveness across his head and shoulders 
1673,then he went off and sat beside the sea  his handsomeness was dazzling 
1674,the girl was shocked 
1675,she told her slaves with tidy hair  now listen to me  girls  the gods who live
1676,on mount olympus must have wished this man to come in contact with my godlike people 
1677,before  he looked so poor and unrefined  now he is like a god that lives in heaven 
1678,i hope i get a man like this as husband  a man that lives here and would like to stay 
1679,but  girls  now give the stranger food and drink  she gave her orders and the girls obeyed they gave odysseus some food and drink 
1680,he wolfed the food and drank 
1681,he was half starved 
1682,it had been ages since he tasted food 
1683,then white armed nausicaa had formed a plan 
1684,folding the clothes  she packed them in the wagon  and yoked the mules  and then she climbed inside 
1685,she gave odysseus some clear instructions 
1686,stranger  get ready  you must go to town  and i will have you meet the best of all our people 
1687,you seem smart  do as i say 
1688,while we are passing through the fields and farmlands  you have to follow quickly with the girls
1689,behind the mules  and let me lead the way 
1690,then we will reach the lofty city wall  which has a scenic port on either side  and one slim gate  where curved ships are drawn up along the road  a special spot for each 
1691,the meeting place surrounds poseidon s shrine  fitted with heavy stones set deep in earth 
1692,and there the workers make the ships equipment cables and sails and there they plane the oars 
1693,phaeacians do not care for archery 
1694,their passion is for sails and oars and ships  on which they love to cross the dark gray ocean 
1695,the people in the town are proud  i worry that they may speak against me  someone rude may say  who is that big strong man with her 
1696,where did she find that stranger 
1697,will he be her husband 
1698,she has got him from a ship  a foreigner  since no one lives near here  or else a god  the answer to her prayers  descended from the sky to hold her tight 
1699,better if she has found herself a man from elsewhere  since she scorns the people here  although she has so many noble suitors 
1700,so they will shame me  i myself would blame a girl who got too intimate with men before her marriage  and who went against her loving parents rules 
1701,but listen  stranger  i will explain the quickest way to gain my father s help to make your way back home 
1702,beside the road there is a grove of poplars 
1703,it has a fountain  and a meadow round it 
1704,it is athena s place  where father has his orchard and estate  as far from town as human voice can carry 
1705,sit down there and wait until i reach my father s house in town 
1706,but when you think i have arrived  walk on and ask directions for the palace of king alcinous  my mighty father 
1707,it will be very easy finding it  a tiny child could guide you there 
1708,it is
1709,unlike the other houses in phaeacia 
1710,go through the courtyard  in the house and on straight to the great hall 
1711,you will find my mother sitting beside the hearth by firelight  and spinning her amazing purple wool 
1712,she leans against a pillar  slaves behind her 
1713,my father has a throne right next to hers  he sits and sips his wine  just like a god 
1714,but pass him by  embrace my mother s knees to supplicate 
1715,if you do this  you quickly
1716,will reach your home  however far it is  in happiness 
1717,if she is good to you  and looks upon you kindly in her heart  you can be sure of getting to your house  back to your family and native land 
1718,with that  she used her shining whip to urge the mules to go 
1719,they left the river streams  and trotted well and clipped their hooves along 
1720,she drove an easy pace to let her slaves and great odysseus keep up on foot 
1721,the sun was setting when they reached the grove  the famous sanctuary of athena 
1722,odysseus sat in it  and at once he prayed to mighty zeus daughter 
1723,hear me  daughter of zeus  unvanquished queen  if ever  when that earth shaker god was wrecking me  you helped me may they pity me and give me kind welcome in phaeacia 
1724,and athena heard him but did not yet appear to him  respecting her own brother in his fury
1725,against odysseus till he reached home 
1726,a magical kingdom odysseus sat patiently and prayed 
1727,meanwhile  the fine strong mules conveyed the girl to town  she reached her father s palace gate 
1728,her brothers gathered round her like immortals 
1729,they took the harness off the mules and brought the clothes inside 
1730,she went to her own room 
1731,eurymedusa  her old slave  had lit a fire for her 
1732,this woman had been brought from apeire by ship  long years before 
1733,the people chose to give her to the king 
1734,because they bowed before him like a god 
1735,she used to babysit young nausicaa  and now she lit her fire and cooked her meal 
1736,odysseus walked briskly to the town 
1737,athena helpfully surrounded him with mist that kept him safe him from rude remarks from people who might ask him who he was 
1738,when he had almost reached the lovely city  bright eyed athena met him  like a girl  young and unmarried  with a water pitcher 
1739,she stopped in front of him 
1740,odysseus said  child  would you escort me to the house of king alcinous  who rules this land 
1741,i have been through hard times 
1742,i traveled here from far away  i am a foreigner  and i know no one who lives here in town or anywhere round here 
1743,with twinkling eyes the goddess answered  mr  foreigner  i will take you to where you want to go 
1744,the king lives near my father s home 
1745,but you
1746,must walk in silence 
1747,do not look at people  and ask no questions 
1748,people here are not too keen on strangers coming from abroad  although they like to cross the sea themselves 
1749,they know their ships go very fast 
1750,poseidon gave them this gift 
1751,their boats can fly like wings  or quick as thoughts 
1752,the goddess led him there 
1753,he followed closely in her skipping steps 
1754,the seafaring phaeacians did not see him as he passed through the town  since that great goddess 
1755,pigtailed athena  in her care for him made him invisible with magic mist 
1756,he was amazed to see the ships and harbors and meeting places of the noblemen  and high walls set with stakes on top a wonder  they reached the splendid palace of the king 
1757,divine athena winked at him and said  here  mr  foreigner  this is the house you wanted me to take you to 
1758,you will find them  the king and queen  inside at dinner 
1759,do not be scared  go in 
1760,the brave succeed in all adventures  even those who come from countries far away 
1761,first greet the queen 
1762,arete is her name 
1763,the king and queen have common ancestry nausithous 
1764,eurymedon was long ago the king over the giants  who were proud and bad 
1765,he killed them  his own people  and then he got killed as well 
1766,his youngest daughter was named periboea 
1767,she was very pretty 
1768,poseidon slept with her 
1769,she had a child  nausithous  and he became the king here in phaeacia  and he had two sons  our king alcinous  and rhexenor 
1770,apollo shot that rhexenor when he was newly married  with no son 
1771,he left a daughter  our arete  and her uncle  alcinous  made her his wife 
1772,no woman is honored as he honors her 
1773,she is precious to him  her children  and the people 
1774,we look at her as if she were a goddess  and point her out when she walks through our town 
1775,she is extremely clever and perceptive  she solves disputes to help the men she likes 
1776,if she looks on you kindly in her heart  you have a chance of seeing those you love  and getting back again to your big house and homeland 
1777,so bright eyed athena left him 
1778,she went from lovely scheria  across the tireless sea  to marathon and athens 
1779,and went inside erechtheus palace 
1780,odysseus approached the royal house  and stood there by the threshold made of bronze 
1781,his heart was mulling over many things 
1782,the palace of the mighty king was high  and shone like rays of sunlight or of moonlight 
1783,the walls were bronze all over  from the entrance back to the bedrooms  and along them ran a frieze of blue 
1784,gold doors held safe the house 
1785,pillars of silver rose up from the threshold 
1786,the lintel silver  and the handle  gold 
1787,silver and golden dogs stood at each side  made by hephaestus with great artistry  to guard the home of brave alcinous immortal dogs  unaging for all time 
1788,at intervals were seats set in the walls  right from the doorway to the inner rooms  with soft embroidered throws  the work of women 
1789,phaeacian lords and ladies sat upon them  eating and drinking  since they lacked for nothing 
1790,boys made of gold were set on pedestals  and they held burning torches in their hands  lighting the hall at night for those at dinner 
1791,the king had fifty slave girls in his house  some ground the yellow grain upon the millstone  others wove cloth and sat there spinning yarn  with fingers quick as rustling poplar leaves  and oil was dripping from the woven fabric 
1792,just as phaeacian men have special talent for launching ships to sea  the women there
1793,are expert weavers  since athena gave them fine minds and skill to make most lovely things 
1794,outside the courtyard by the doors there grows an orchard of four acres  hedged around 
1795,the trees are tall  luxuriant with fruit  bright colored apples  pears and pomegranate  sweet figs and fertile olives  and the crop never runs out or withers in the winter  nor in the summer 
1796,fruit grows all year round 
1797,the west wind always blows and makes it swell
1798,and ripen  mellowing pear on mellowing pear  apple on apple  grapes on grapes  and figs 
1799,a fertile vineyard too is planted there 
1800,they use the warmer side  a flattened slope  for drying grapes in sunshine 
1801,they pick bunches and trample them  while unripe clusters open and she would their blooms  and others turn to purple 
1802,there are two springs  one flows all through the garden  the other gushes from the courtyard threshold  towards the palace  and the people draw
1803,freshwater 
1804,so the gods had blessed the house of king alcinous with lovely gifts 
1805,hardened  long suffering odysseus stood there and stared  astonished in his heart  then quickly strode across the palace threshold 
1806,he found the lordly leaders of phaeacia pouring drink offerings for sharp eyed hermes  to whom they give libations before bed 
1807,odysseus went in the house disguised in mist with which athena covered him 
1808,until he reached arete and the king 
1809,he threw his arms around arete s knees  and all at once  the magic mist dispersed 
1810,they were astonished when they saw the man  and all fell silent 
1811,then odysseus said  queen arete  child of rhexenor  i have had many years of pain and loss 
1812,i beg you  and your husband  and these men who feast here may the gods bless you in life  and may you leave your children wealth and honor 
1813,now help me  please  to get back home  and quickly  i miss my family 
1814,i have been gone so long it hurts 
1815,he sat down by the hearth among the ashes of the fire 
1816,they all were silent till echeneus spoke up 
1817,he was an elder statesman of phaeacia  a skillful orator and learned man  wanting to help  he said  alcinous  you know it is not right to leave a stranger sitting there on the floor beside the hearth
1818,among the cinders 
1819,everyone is waiting for you to give the word 
1820,make him get up  and seat him on a silver chair  and order wine to be poured  so we may make libations to zeus the thunderlord  who loves the needy 
1821,the house girl ought to bring the stranger food out from the storeroom 
1822,so alcinous reached for odysseus hand  and raised the many minded hero from the ashes 
1823,he made laodamas  his favorite son 
1824,vacate his chair so he could sit beside him 
1825,the slave girl brought him water in a pitcher of gold to wash his hands  and poured it out over a silver bowl  and fetched a table of polished wood  a humble slave brought out bread and an ample plateful of the meat 
1826,half starved and weak  the hero ate and drank 
1827,majestic king alcinous addressed pontonous  the wine boy 
1828,go and mix a bowl and serve the wine to all our guests 
1829,so we may offer drink to thundering zeus who blesses those in need 
1830,the boy mixed up the sweet  delicious wine  and filled the cups for everyone  with first pour for the gods 
1831,they made the offerings and drank as much as they desired  and then alcinous said  listen  lords 
1832,hear what my heart commands 
1833,the feast is over  go home  go to bed 
1834,at dawn  we will call more of our best men  and host the stranger in our halls  and offer
1835,fine sacrifices to the gods  then plan how we may help his journey  so our guest may travel quickly  without pain or trouble  encountering no trouble on the way  however far away it is  until he reaches home 
1836,once there  he must endure whatever was spun out when he was born by fate and by the heavy ones  the spinners 
1837,but if he is immortal  come from heaven  the gods have changed their ways  since in the past
1838,they used to show themselves to us directly whenever we would give them hecatombs 
1839,they sit and eat among us 
1840,even if just one of us meets them alone  out walking  they do not hide from us  we are close friends  as are the giants and cyclopic peoples 
1841,odysseus  with careful calculation  said  no  alcinous  please think again 
1842,i am not like the deathless gods in heaven 
1843,my height is normal 
1844,i look like a human 
1845,in pain i am a match for any man  whoever you may know that suffers most 
1846,i could tell many stories of the dangers that i have suffered through  gods willed it so 
1847,but let me have my meal  despite my grief 
1848,the belly is just like a whining dog  it begs and forces one to notice it  despite exhaustion or the depths of sorrow 
1849,my heart is full of sorrow  but my stomach is always telling me to eat and drink 
1850,it tells me to forget what i have suffered  and fill it up 
1851,at dawn tomorrow  help me to reach my homeland  after all this pain 
1852,may i live out my final days in sight of my own property and slaves and home 
1853,they all agreed the stranger s words made sense  and that he should be sent back home 
1854,they poured drink offerings to the gods  and drank as much as they desired  then all went home to bed 
1855,odysseus was left there in the hall 
1856,sitting beside arete and the godlike alcinous 
1857,the dishes from the feast were cleaned up by the slaves 
1858,white armed arete had noticed his fine clothes  the cloak and shirt she wove herself  with help from her slave girls 
1859,her words flew out to him as if on wings 
1860,stranger  let me be first to speak to you 
1861,where are you from 
1862,and who gave you those clothes 
1863,i thought you said you drifted here by sea 
1864,planning his words with careful skill  he answered 
1865,it would be difficult  your majesty  to tell it all  the gods have given me so many troubles 
1866,i will tell you this 
1867,there is an island  far out in the sea  ogygia  where the child of atlas lives  the mighty goddess with smooth braids  the crafty calypso  friend to neither gods nor mortals 
1868,a spirit brought me to her hearth  alone  when zeus scooped up my ship and with bright lightning split it apart across the wine dark sea 
1869,all of my comrades  my brave friends  were killed 
1870,i wrapped my arms around the keel and floated for ten days 
1871,on the tenth black night  the gods carried me till i reached ogygia  home of the beautiful and mighty goddess calypso 
1872,lovingly she cared for me  vowing to set me free from death and time forever 
1873,but she never swayed my heart 
1874,i stayed for seven years  she gave me clothes like those of gods  but they were always wet
1875,with tears 
1876,at last the eighth year rolled around  and word came down from zeus that i must go  and finally her mind was changed 
1877,she sent me upon a well bound wooden raft  equipped with food  sweet wine  and clothes as if for gods  and sent a fair warm wind 
1878,i sailed the sea for seventeen long days  on day eighteen  the murky mountains of your land appeared  and i was overjoyed  but more bad luck was hurled at me  poseidon roused the winds
1879,to block me  and he stirred the sea 
1880,i sobbed  and clung there  going nowhere  till my raft was smashed to pieces by the massive storm 
1881,but i swam through this gulf of water till the current brought me here 
1882,if i had tried to land at once  i would have been swept back against the crags 
1883,i swam a way away  until i reached a river mouth  which seemed a perfect spot for landing  it was sheltered from wind  and smooth  quite free from rocks 
1884,so there
1885,i flopped and tried to gather up my strength until the holy nightfall 
1886,then i crawled out of the rain fed river to the bank  and hid inside the bushes  and i heaped some leaves to cover me  some god poured down deep sleep 
1887,with heavy heart i slept all night and through the dawn to noon  beneath the leaves 
1888,then in the afternoon  when sleep released me  i woke  and saw girls playing on the beach your daughter  like a goddess  and her slaves 
1889,i prayed to her 
1890,one would not think a girl as young as her would have so much good sense  young people are not usually so thoughtful 
1891,she was so kind to me  she gave me food and wine  and had them wash me in the river  and let me have these clothes 
1892,now i have told you the truth  no matter what 
1893,alcinous said  just one of these things that my daughter did was not correct  she should have brought you here to us herself  escorted by her slave girls 
1894,since you had supplicated first to her 
1895,with careful tact odysseus replied  your daughter is quite wonderful  great king 
1896,please do not blame her 
1897,she told me to come here with her slaves  but i was too embarrassed  and nervous 
1898,i thought you might get annoyed at seeing me  we humans on this earth are apt to be suspicious 
1899,and the king replied  my heart is not the type to feel anger for no good reason 
1900,moderation
1901,is always best 
1902,athena  zeus  apollo  what a congenial man you are  i wish you would stay here  and marry my own daughter  and be my son 
1903,i would give you a home and wealth if you would like to stay 
1904,if not  we will not keep you here against your will 
1905,may zeus not have it so  as for your journey  i give my word that you can go tomorrow 
1906,lying down  lulled to sleep  you will be rowed across the peaceful sea until you reach
1907,your land and home  or anywhere you want  even beyond euboea  which our people saw when they carried fair haired rhadamanthus to visit tityus  the son of gaia 
1908,it is supposed to be the farthest shore on earth  but they were there and back that day  not even tired 
1909,that shows just how fine my ships are  and my men who stir the sea with oars 
1910,at that odysseus  who had endured so much  was happy  and he prayed 
1911,o father zeus  may everything come true  just as alcinous has said 
1912,so may his fame burn bright forever on the earth  and may i reach my home 
1913,then at these words  white armed arete called to her attendants to put a bed out on the porch and lay fine purple blankets on it and to spread covers and woolly quilts across the top 
1914,with torches in their hands they bustled out 
1915,they made the bed up neatly  very fast 
1916,then came and called odysseus 
1917,now guest  get up and come outside  your bed is ready 
1918,odysseus was glad to go to sleep after his long adventures  on that bed surrounded by the rustling of the porch 
1919,alcinous was sleeping in his room  beside his wife  who made their bed and shared it 
1920,the songs of a poet soon dawn appeared and touched the sky with roses 
1921,majestic  holy king alcinous leapt out of bed  as did odysseus  the city sacker 
1922,then the blessed king  mighty alcinous  led out his guest to the phaeacian council by the ships 
1923,they sat there side by side on polished stones 
1924,meanwhile  athena walked all through the town  appearing like the royal messenger 
1925,to help odysseus journey home 
1926,she stood beside each man in turn and said  my lord  come to the meeting place  to learn about the visitor to our king s home 
1927,despite his wanderings by sea  he looks like an immortal god 
1928,so she roused up the hearts and minds of each  and soon the seats of council were filled up  the men assembled 
1929,seeing laertes clever son  the crowd marveled 
1930,athena poured unearthly charm upon his head and shoulders  and she made him
1931,taller and sturdier  so these phaeacians would welcome and respect him  when he managed the many trials of skill that they would set to test him 
1932,when the people were assembled  alcinous addressed them 
1933,hear me  leaders and chieftains of phaeacia 
1934,i will tell you the promptings of my heart 
1935,this foreigner i do not know his name came wandering from west or east and showed up at my house 
1936,he begs and prays for help to travel on 
1937,let us assist him  as we have before with other guests  no visitor has ever been forced to linger in my house 
1938,we always give them safe passage home 
1939,now let us launch a ship for her maiden voyage on the water  and choose a crew of fifty two  the men selected as the best  and lash the oars beside the benches 
1940,then return to shore  and come to my house 
1941,let the young men hurry to cook a feast 
1942,i will provide supplies 
1943,plenty for everyone 
1944,and i invite you also  lords  to welcome him with me  do not refuse  we also must invite demodocus  the poet 
1945,gods inspire him  so any song he chooses to perform is wonderful to hear 
1946,he led the way 
1947,the lords went with him  and the house boy fetched the bard 
1948,the fifty two select young men went to the shore  just as the king commanded 
1949,they reached the restless salty sea  and launched
1950,the black ship on the depths  set up the mast and sails  and fastened in the oars  by tying each to its leather thole strap  all in order 
1951,they spread the white sails wide  and moored the ship out in the water 
1952,then the men walked up towards the mighty palace of the king 
1953,the halls and porticoes were thronged with people  both old and young 
1954,to feed his many guests alcinous killed twelve sheep  and eight boars with silver tusks  and two slow lumbering cows 
1955,skinning the animals  they cooked a feast 
1956,the house boy brought the poet  whom the muse adored 
1957,she gave him two gifts  good and bad  she took his sight away  but gave sweet song 
1958,the wine boy brought a silver studded chair and propped it by a pillar  in the middle of all the guests  and by a peg he hung the poet s lyre above his head and helped him to reach it  and he set a table by him  and a bread basket and a cup of wine
1959,to drink whenever he desired 
1960,they all took food 
1961,when they were satisfied  the muse prompted the bard to sing of famous actions  an episode whose fame has touched the sky  achilles and odysseus quarrel how at a splendid sacrificial feast  they argued bitterly  and agamemnon was glad because the best of the achaeans were quarreling  since when he had consulted the oracle at pytho  crossing over
1962,the entry stone  apollo had foretold that this would be the start of suffering for greeks and trojans  through the plans of zeus 
1963,so sang the famous bard 
1964,odysseus with his strong hands picked up his heavy cloak of purple  and he covered up his face 
1965,he was ashamed to let them see him cry 
1966,each time the singer paused  odysseus wiped tears  drew down the cloak and poured a splash of wine out of his goblet  for the gods 
1967,but each time  the phaeacian nobles urged the bard to sing again they loved his songs 
1968,so he would start again  odysseus would moan and hide his head beneath his cloak 
1969,only alcinous could see his tears  since he was sitting next to him  and heard his sobbing 
1970,so he quickly spoke 
1971,my lords  we have already satisfied our wish for feasting  and the lyre  the feast s companion 
1972,now let us go outside and set up contests
1973,in every sport  so when our guest goes home he can tell all his friends we are the best at boxing  wrestling  high jumping  and sprinting 
1974,with that he led the way  the others followed 
1975,the boy took down the lyre from its peg and took demodocus hand to lead him out with the crowd who went to watch the games 
1976,many young athletes stood there  acrone s  ocyalus  elatreus  nauteus  tho n  anchialus  eretmeus 
1977,anabesineus and ponteus  prymneus  proreus  amphialus  the son of polynaus  son of tecton  and naubolus son  euryalus  like ares  because of ruin 
1978,in his looks and strength  he was the best in all phaeacia  after laodamas 
1979,three sons of great alcinous stood up  laodamas  godlike clytoneus  and halius 
1980,first came the footrace 
1981,they lined up  then dashed
1982,all in an instant  right around the track so fast they raised the dust up from the field 
1983,clytoneus was the best by far at sprinting  he raced past all the others by the length of a field plowed by mules  and reached the crowd 
1984,next came the brutal sport of wrestling  in which euryalus was best 
1985,in jumping  amphialus excelled 
1986,and at the discus  by far the best of all was elatreus 
1987,the prince laodamas excelled at boxing 
1988,they all enjoyed the games 
1989,when they were over  laodamas  alcinous son  said  now my friends  we ought to ask the stranger if he plays any sports 
1990,his build is strong  his legs and arms and neck are very sturdy  and he is in his prime  though he has been broken by suffering 
1991,no pain can shake a man as badly as the sea  however strong he once was 
1992,euryalus replied  you are quite right  laodamas 
1993,why not
1994,call out to challenge him yourself 
1995,the noble son of alcinous agreed with him 
1996,he stood up in the middle of them all and called odysseus 
1997,come here  he said 
1998,now you  sir  you should try our games as well  if you know any sports  it seems you would 
1999,nothing can be more glorious for a man  in a whole lifetime  than what he achieves with hands and feet 
2000,so try  set care aside 
2001,soon you will travel  since your ship is launched 
2002,the crew is standing by 
2003,odysseus thought carefully he had a plan 
2004,he answered  laodamas  why mock me with this challenge 
2005,my heart is set on sorrow  not on games  since i have suffered and endured so much that now i only want to get back home 
2006,i sit here praying to your king and people to grant my wish 
2007,euryalus responded with outright taunting 
2008,stranger  i suppose you must be ignorant of all athletics 
2009,i know your type 
2010,the captain of a crew of merchant sailors  you roam round at sea and only care about your freight and cargo  keeping close watch on your ill gotten gains 
2011,you are no athlete 
2012,with a scowl  he answered  what crazy arrogance from you  you stranger  the gods do not bless everyone the same  with equal gifts of body  mind  or speech 
2013,one man is weak  but gods may crown his words with loveliness 
2014,men gladly look to him 
2015,his speech is steady  with calm dignity 
2016,he stands out from his audience  and when he walks through town  the people look at him as if he were a god 
2017,another man has godlike looks but no grace in his words 
2018,like you you look impressive  and a god could not improve your body 
2019,but your mind is crippled 
2020,you have stirred my heart to anger with these outrageous comments 
2021,i am not lacking experience of sports and games 
2022,when i was young  i trusted my strong arms and was among the first 
2023,now pain has crushed me  i have endured the agonies of war  and struggled through the dangers of the sea 
2024,but you have challenged me and stung my heart 
2025,despite my suffering  i will compete 
2026,with that he leapt up  cloak and all  and seized a massive discus  heavier than that used by the others 
2027,he spun around  drew back his arm and from his brawny hand he hurled 
2028,the stone went humming 
2029,the phaeacians  known for rowing  ducked down cowering beneath its arc  it flew beyond the other pegs 
2030,athena marked the spot 
2031,in human guise she spoke 
2032,a blind man  stranger  could discern this mark by groping 
2033,it is far ahead of all the others 
2034,you can celebrate  you won this round  and none of them will ever throw further or as far  odysseus was thrilled to realize he had a friend
2035,to take his side  and with a lighter heart  he told the young phaeacians  try to match this  if you can do it  i will throw another  as far or farther 
2036,you have made me angry  so i will take you on in any sport 
2037,come on  in boxing  wrestling  or sprinting  i will compete with anyone  except laodamas  he is my host 
2038,who would fight with a friend 
2039,a man who challenges those who have welcomed him in a strange land
2040,is worthless and a fool  he spites himself 
2041,but i will challenge any of you others 
2042,test my ability  let me know yours 
2043,i am not weak at any sport men practice 
2044,i know the way to hold a polished bow 
2045,i always was the first to hit my man out of a horde of enemies  though many comrades stood by me  arrows taking aim 
2046,at troy  when the achaeans shot their bows  the only one superior to me
2047,was philoctetes 
2048,other men who eat their bread on earth are all worse shots than me  but i will not compete with super archers  with heracles or eurytus  who risked competing with the gods at archery 
2049,apollo was enraged at him and killed him as soon as he proposed it 
2050,he died young and did not reach old age in his own home 
2051,and i can throw a spear beyond the shots that others reach with arrows 
2052,i am only
2053,concerned that one of you may win the footrace  i lost my stamina and my legs weakened during my time at sea  upon the raft  i could not do my exercise routine 
2054,the crowd was silent  but alcinous said  sir  you have expressed  with fine good manners  your wish to show your talents  and your anger at that man who stood up in this arena and mocked you  as no one who understands how to speak properly would ever do 
2055,now listen carefully  so you may tell your own fine friends at home when you are feasting beside your wife and children  and remember our skill in all the deeds we have accomplished from our forefathers time till now 
2056,we are not brilliant at wrestling or boxing  but we are quick at sprinting  and with ships we are the best 
2057,we love the feast  the lyre  dancing and varied clothes  hot baths and bed 
2058,but now let the best dancers of phaeacia
2059,perform  so that our guest may tell his friends when he gets home  how excellent we are at seafaring  at running  and at dancing and song 
2060,let someone bring the well tuned lyre from inside for demodocus go quickly  so spoke the king 
2061,the house boy brought the lyre 
2062,the people chose nine referees to check the games were fair 
2063,they leveled out a floor for dancing  with a fine wide ring around 
2064,the house boy gave demodocus the lyre 
2065,he walked into the middle  flanked by boys  young and well trained  who tapped their feet performing the holy dance  their quick legs bright with speed 
2066,odysseus was wonder struck to see it 
2067,the poet strummed and sang a charming song about the love of fair crowned aphrodite for ares  who gave lavish gifts to her and shamed the bed of lord hephaestus  where they secretly had sex 
2068,the sun god saw them  and told hephaestus bitter news for him 
2069,he marched into his forge to get revenge  and set the mighty anvil on its block  and hammered chains so strong that they could never be broken or undone 
2070,he was so angry at ares 
2071,when his trap was made  he went inside the room of his beloved bed  and twined the mass of cables all around the bedposts  and then hung them from the ceiling  like slender spiderwebs  so finely made that nobody could see them  even gods 
2072,the craftsmanship was so ingenious 
2073,when he had set that trap across the bed  he traveled to the cultured town of lemnos  which was his favorite place in all the world 
2074,ares the golden rider had kept watch 
2075,he saw hephaestus  famous wonder worker  leaving his house  and went inside himself  he wanted to make love with aphrodite 
2076,she had returned from visiting her father  the mighty son of cronus  there she sat 
2077,then ares took her hand and said to her  my darling  let us go to bed 
2078,hephaestus is out of town  he must have gone to lemnos to see the sintians whose speech is strange 
2079,she was excited to lie down with him  they went to bed together 
2080,but the chains ingenious hephaestus had created wrapped tight around them  so they could not move or get up 
2081,then they knew that they were trapped 
2082,the limping god drew near before he reached
2083,the land of lemnos  he had turned back home 
2084,troubled at heart  he came towards his house 
2085,standing there in the doorway  he was seized by savage rage 
2086,he gave a mighty shout  calling to all the gods  o father zeus  and all you blessed gods who live forever  look  you may laugh  but it is hard to bear 
2087,see how my aphrodite  child of zeus  is disrespecting me for being lame 
2088,she loves destructive ares  who is strong
2089,and handsome 
2090,i am weak 
2091,i blame my parents 
2092,if only i had not been born  but come  see where those two are sleeping in my bed  as lovers 
2093,i am horrified to see it 
2094,but i predict they will not want to lie longer like that  however great their love 
2095,soon they will want to wake up  but my trap and chains will hold them fast  until her father pays back the price i gave him for his daughter 
2096,her eyes stare at me like a dog 
2097,she is
2098,so beautiful  but lacking self control 
2099,the gods assembled at his house  poseidon  earth shaker  helpful hermes  and apollo 
2100,the goddesses stayed home  from modesty 
2101,the blessed gods who give good things were standing inside the doorway  and they burst out laughing  at what a clever trap hephaestus set 
2102,and as they looked  they said to one another  crime does not pay  the slow can beat the quick  as now hephaestus  who is lame and slow 
2103,has used his skill to catch the fastest sprinter of all those on olympus 
2104,ares owes the price for his adultery 
2105,they gossiped 
2106,apollo  son of zeus  then said to hermes  hermes my brother  would you like to sleep with golden aphrodite  in her bed  even weighed down by mighty chains 
2107,and hermes the sharp eyed messenger replied  ah  brother  apollo lord of archery  if only  i would be bound three times as tight or more
2108,and let you gods and all your wives look on  if only i could sleep with aphrodite 
2109,then laughter rose among the deathless gods 
2110,only poseidon did not laugh 
2111,he begged and pleaded with hephaestus to release ares 
2112,he told the wonder working god  now let him go  i promise he will pay the penalty in full among the gods  just as you ask 
2113,the famous limping god replied  poseidon  do not ask me this 
2114,it is disgusting  bailing scoundrels out 
2115,how could i bind you  while the gods look on  if ares should escape his bonds and debts 
2116,poseidon  lord of earthquakes  answered him  hephaestus  if he tries to dodge this debt  i promise i will pay 
2117,the limping god said  then  in courtesy to you  i must do as you ask 
2118,so using all his strength  hephaestus loosed the chains 
2119,the pair of lovers were free from their constraints  and both jumped up 
2120,ares went off to thrace  while aphrodite smiled as she went to cyprus  to the island of paphos  where she had a fragrant altar and sanctuary 
2121,the graces washed her there  and rubbed her with the magic oil that glows upon immortals  and they dressed her up in gorgeous clothes 
2122,she looked astonishing 
2123,that was the poet s song 
2124,odysseus was happy listening  so were they all 
2125,and then alcinous told halius
2126,to dance with laodamas  no one danced as well as them 
2127,they took a purple ball which polybus the artisan had made them 
2128,one boy would leap and toss it to the clouds  the other would jump up  feet off the ground  and catch it easily before he landed 
2129,after they practiced throwing it straight upwards  they danced across the fertile earth  crisscrossing  constantly trading places 
2130,other boys who stood around the field were beating time
2131,with noisy stomping 
2132,then odysseus said  king of many citizens  great lord  you boasted that your dancers are the best  and it is true 
2133,i feel amazed to see this marvelous show 
2134,that pleased the reverend king 
2135,he spoke at once to his seafaring people 
2136,hear me  phaeacian leaders  lords and nobles 
2137,the stranger seems extremely wise to me  so let us give him gifts  as hosts should do to guests in friendship 
2138,twelve lords rule our people 
2139,with me as thirteenth lord 
2140,let us each bring a pound of precious gold and laundered clothes  a tunic and a cloak 
2141,then pile them up  and let our guest take all these gifts  and go to dinner with them  happy in his heart 
2142,euryalus should tell him he is sorry  and give a special gift  since what he said was inappropriate 
2143,they all agreed  and each sent back a deputy to fetch the presents 
2144,and euryalus spoke out 
2145,my lord alcinous  great king of kings  i will apologize  as you command 
2146,and i will give him this bronze sword which has a silver handle  and a scabbard carved of ivory a precious gift for him 
2147,with that he put the silver studded sword into odysseus hands  his words flew out 
2148,i welcome you  sir 
2149,be our guest 
2150,if something rude of any kind was said  let the winds take it 
2151,may the gods allow you
2152,to reach your home and see your wife again  since you have suffered so long  far away from those who love you 
2153,and odysseus said  friend  i wish you well 
2154,may gods protect you  and may you never miss the sword you gave me  with that  he strapped the silver studded sword across his back  and as the sun went down the precious gifts were brought to him 
2155,the slaves took them inside alcinous house 
2156,the princes piled the lovely things beside
2157,the queen  their mother 
2158,king alcinous led everyone inside and had them sit on upright chairs 
2159,he told arete  wife  bring out our finest chest  and put inside it a tunic and a freshly laundered cloak 
2160,set a bronze cauldron on the fire to boil  so he can take a bath 
2161,then let him see the precious gifts our noblemen have brought  and then enjoy the banquet and the song 
2162,i also have a gift  a splendid cup
2163,of gold 
2164,i hope he always thinks of me whenever he pours offerings to zeus and other gods 
2165,arete told her slaves to quickly set a mighty pot to warm  for washing 
2166,so upon the blazing flames they set the cauldron and poured water in  and heaped up wood 
2167,the fire licked around the belly of the tub and warmed the water 
2168,arete brought from her own room a chest to give the guest  and packed the gifts inside
2169,the clothes and gold that they had given him  and she herself put in a cloak and tunic 
2170,she told him  watch the lid  and tie it closed  so nobody can rob you as you travel  when you are lulled to sleep on your black ship 
2171,odysseus  experienced in loss  took careful note 
2172,he shut the lid and tied a cunning knot that he had learned from circe 
2173,then right away the slave girl led him off towards the bath to wash  he was delighted
2174,to see hot water 
2175,he had not been bathed since he had left the home of curly haired calypso  who had taken care of him as if he were a god 
2176,the slave girls washed him  rubbed oil on him and dressed him in a tunic and fine wool mantle 
2177,freshly bathed  he joined the men at wine 
2178,and there stood nausicaa  divinely beautiful  beside a pillar that held the palace roof 
2179,she was amazed to see odysseus 
2180,her words flew fast 
2181,good bye then  stranger  but remember me when you reach home  because you owe your life to me  i helped you first 
2182,odysseus replied politely  nausicaa  may zeus  husband of hera  mighty lord of thunder  allow me to go back and see my home 
2183,there i shall pray to you as to a god  forever  princess  since you saved my life 
2184,with that he went to sit beside the king 
2185,now they were serving out the food and pouring
2186,wine  and the steward led out to the center demodocus  the well respected poet 
2187,he sat him in the middle of the banquet  against a pillar 
2188,then odysseus thought fast  and sliced a helping from the pig  all richly laced with fat 
2189,the plate of meat had plenty left 
2190,he told the boy  go take this meat and give it to demodocus 
2191,despite my grief  i would be glad to meet him 
2192,poets are honored by all those who live
2193,on earth 
2194,the muse has taught them how to sing  she loves the race of poets 
2195,so the house boy handed it to demodocus 
2196,he took it gladly  and everybody took their food 
2197,when they had had enough to eat and drink  the clever mastermind of many schemes said  you are wonderful  demodocus  i praise you more than anyone  apollo  or else the muse  the child of zeus  has taught you 
2198,you tell so accurately what the greeks
2199,achieved  and what they suffered  there at troy  as if you had been there  or heard about it from somebody who was 
2200,so sing the story about the wooden horse  which epeius built with athena s help 
2201,odysseus dragged it inside and to the citadel  filled up with men to sack the town 
2202,if you can tell that as it happened  i will say that you truly are blessed with inspiration 
2203,a god inspired the bard to sing 
2204,he started
2205,with how the greeks set fire to their camp and then embarked and sailed away 
2206,meanwhile  odysseus brought in a gang of men into the heart of troy  inside the horse 
2207,the trojans pulled the thing up to the summit  and sat around discussing what to do 
2208,some said  we ought to strike the wood with swords  others said  drag it higher up and hurl it down from the rocks  but some said they should leave it to pacify the gods 
2209,so it would be 
2210,the town was doomed to ruin when it took that horse  chock full of fighters bringing death to trojans 
2211,and he sang how the achaeans poured from the horse  in ambush from the hollow  and sacked the city  how they scattered out  destroying every neighborhood 
2212,like ares  odysseus  with menelaus  rushed to find deiphobus house  and there he won at last  through dreadful violence  thanks to athena 
2213,so the poet sang 
2214,odysseus was melting into tears  his cheeks were wet with weeping  as a woman weeps  as she falls to wrap her arms around her husband  fallen fighting for his home and children 
2215,she is watching as he gasps and dies 
2216,she shrieks  a clear high wail  collapsing upon his corpse 
2217,the men are right behind 
2218,they hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her to slavery  hard labor  and a life of pain 
2219,her face is marked with her despair 
2220,in that same desperate way  odysseus was crying 
2221,no one noticed that his eyes were wet with tears  except alcinous  who sat right next to him and heard his sobs 
2222,quickly he spoke to his seafaring people 
2223,listen  my lords and nobles of phaeacia  demodocus should stop and set aside the lyre  since what he sings does not give pleasure to everyone 
2224,throughout this heavenly song  since dinnertime  our guest has been in pain 
2225,grieving 
2226,a heavy burden weighs his heart 
2227,let the song end  so we can all be happy  both guest and hosts 
2228,that would be best by far 
2229,this send off party and these precious gifts  which we give out of friendship  are for him  our guest of honor 
2230,any man of sense will treat a guest in need like his own brother 
2231,stranger  now answer all my questions clearly  not with evasion  frankness would be best 
2232,what did your parents name you 
2233,with what name
2234,are you known to your people 
2235,surely no one in all the world is nameless  poor or noble  since parents give a name to every child at birth 
2236,and also tell me of your country  your people  and your city  so our ships  steered by their own good sense  may take you there 
2237,phaeacians have no need of men at helm nor rudders  as in other ships 
2238,our boats intuit what is in the minds of men  and know all human towns and fertile fields 
2239,they rush at full tilt right across the gulf of salty sea  concealed in mist and clouds 
2240,they have no fear of damages or loss 
2241,but once i heard nausithous  my father  say that poseidon hates us for the help we give to take our guests across the sea  and that one day a ship of ours would suffer shipwreck on its return  a mighty mountain would block our town from sight 
2242,so father said 
2243,perhaps the god will bring these things to pass
2244,or not  as is his will 
2245,but come now  tell me about your wanderings  describe the places  the people  and the cities you have seen 
2246,which ones were wild and cruel  unwelcoming  and which were kind to visitors  respecting the gods 
2247,and please explain why you were crying  sobbing your heart out when you heard him sing what happened to the greeks at troy 
2248,the gods devised and measured out this devastation  to make a song for those in times to come 
2249,did you lose somebody at troy 
2250,a man from your wife s family  perhaps her father or brother 
2251,ties of marriage are the closest after the bonds of blood 
2252,or else perhaps you lost the friend who knew you best of all 
2253,a friend can be as close as any brother 
2254,a pirate in a shepherd s cave wily odysseus  the lord of lies  answered  my lord alcinous  great king  it is a splendid thing to hear a poet as talented as this 
2255,his voice is godlike 
2256,i think that there can be no greater pleasure than when the whole community enjoys a banquet  as we sit inside the house  and listen to the singer  and the tables are heaped with bread and meat  the wine boy ladles drink from the bowl and pours it into cups 
2257,to me this seems ideal  a thing of beauty 
2258,now something prompted you to ask about my own sad story 
2259,i will tell you  though the memory increases my despair 
2260,where shall i start 
2261,where can i end 
2262,the gods have given me so much to cry about 
2263,first i will tell my name  so we will be acquainted and if i survive  you can be my guest in my distant home one day 
2264,i am odysseus  laertes son 
2265,known for my many clever tricks and lies 
2266,my fame extends to heaven  but i live in ithaca  where shaking forest hides mount neriton 
2267,close by are other islands  dulichium  and wooded zacynthus and same 
2268,all the others face the dawn  my ithaca is set apart  most distant  facing the dark 
2269,it is a rugged land  but good at raising children 
2270,to my eyes no country could be sweeter 
2271,as you know 
2272,divine calpyso held me in her cave  wanting to marry me  and likewise circe  the trickster  trapped me  and she wanted me to be her husband 
2273,but she never swayed my heart  since when a man is far from home  living abroad  there is no sweeter thing than his own native land and family 
2274,now let me tell you all the trouble zeus has caused me on my journey home from troy 
2275,a blast of wind pushed me off course towards
2276,the cicones in ismarus 
2277,i sacked the town and killed the men 
2278,we took their wives and shared their riches equally among us 
2279,then i said we must run away 
2280,those fools refused to listen 
2281,they were drinking wine excessively  and killing sheep and cattle along the beach 
2282,the cicones called out to neighbors on the mainland  who were strong and numerous  and skilled at horseback fighting  and if need be  on foot 
2283,they came like leaves
2284,and blossoms in the spring at dawn 
2285,then zeus gave us bad luck 
2286,poor us  the enemy assembled round the ships and fought with swords of bronze 
2287,and while the holy morning light was bright and strong  we held them off  though they outnumbered us 
2288,but when the sun turned round and dipped  the hour when oxen are released  the cicones began to overpower us greeks 
2289,six well armed members of my crew died from each ship 
2290,the rest of us survived 
2291,and we escaped the danger 
2292,we prepared to sail away with heavy hearts  relieved to be alive  but grieving for our friends 
2293,before we launched the ships  we called aloud three times to each of our poor lost companions  slaughtered at the hands of the cicones 
2294,the cloud lord zeus hurled north wind at our ships  a terrible typhoon  and covered up the sea and earth with fog 
2295,night fell from heaven and seized us and our ships keeled over sideways 
2296,the sails were ripped three times by blasting wind 
2297,scared for our lives  we hoisted down the sails and rowed with all our might towards the shore 
2298,we stayed there for two days and nights  exhausted  eating our hearts with pain 
2299,when bright haired dawn brought the third morning  we set up our masts  unfurled the shining sails  and climbed aboard 
2300,the wind blew straight  the pilots steered  and i would have come safely home  to my own land  but as i rounded malea  a current
2301,and blast of wind pushed me off course  away from cythera 
2302,for nine days i was swept by stormy winds across the fish filled sea 
2303,on the tenth day  i landed on the island of those who live on food from lotus flowers 
2304,we gathered water  and my crew prepared a meal 
2305,we picnicked by the ships  then i chose two men  and one slave to make the third  to go and scout 
2306,we needed to find out what kind of people lived there on that island 
2307,the scouts encountered humans  lotus eaters  who did not hurt them 
2308,they just shared with them their sweet delicious fruit 
2309,but as they ate it  they lost the will to come back and bring news to me  they wanted only to stay there  feeding on lotus with the lotus eaters 
2310,they had forgotten home 
2311,i dragged them back in tears  forced them on board the hollow ships  pushed them below the decks  and tied them up 
2312,i told the other men  the loyal ones 
2313,to get back in the ships  so no one else would taste the lotus and forget about our destination 
2314,they embarked and sat along the rowing benches  side by side  and struck the grayish water with their oars 
2315,with heavy hearts we sailed along and reached the country of high minded cyclopes  the mavericks 
2316,they put their trust in gods  and do not plant their food from seed  nor plow  and yet the barley  grain  and clustering wine grapes
2317,all flourish there  increased by rain from zeus 
2318,they hold no councils  have no common laws  but live in caves on lofty mountaintops  and each makes laws for his own wife and children  without concern for what the others think 
2319,a distance from this island is another  across the water  slantways from the harbor  level and thickly wooded 
2320,countless goats live there but people never visit it 
2321,no hunters labor through its woods to scale
2322,its hilly peaks 
2323,there are no flocks of sheep  no fields of plowland it is all untilled  unsown and uninhabited by humans 
2324,only the bleating goats live there and graze 
2325,cyclopic people have no red cheeked ships and no shipwright among them who could build boats  to enable them to row across to other cities  as most people do  crossing the sea to visit one another 
2326,with boats they could have turned this island into
2327,a fertile colony  with proper harvests 
2328,by the gray shore there lie well watered meadows  where vines would never fail 
2329,there is flat land for plowing  and abundant crops would grow in the autumn  there is richness underground 
2330,the harbor has good anchorage  there is no need of anchor stones or ropes or cables 
2331,the ships that come to shore there can remain beached safely till the sailors wish to leave and fair winds blow 
2332,up by the harbor head
2333,freshwater gushes down beneath the caves 
2334,the poplars grow around it 
2335,there we sailed  the gods were guiding us all through the darkness 
2336,thick fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky the moon was dark and clothed in clouds  so we saw nothing of the island 
2337,none of us could see the great waves rolling in towards the land  until we rowed right to the beach 
2338,we lowered all the sails and disembarked onto the shore  and there we fell asleep 
2339,when early dawn shone forth with rosy fingers  we roamed around that island full of wonders 
2340,the daughters of the great king zeus  the nymphs  drove out the mountain goats so that my crew could eat 
2341,on seeing them  we dashed to fetch our javelins and bows from on board ship 
2342,we split into three groups  took aim and shot 
2343,some god gave us good hunting 
2344,all twelve crews had nine goats each  and ten for mine 
2345,we sat there all day till sunset  eating meat and drinking
2346,our strong red wine 
2347,the ships supply of that had not run out  when we had sacked the holy citadel of the cicones  we all took gallons of it  poured in great big pitchers 
2348,we looked across the narrow strip of water at the cyclopic island  saw their smoke  and heard the baaing of their sheep and goats 
2349,the sun went down and in the hours of darkness we lay and slept on shore beside the sea 
2350,but when the rosy hands of dawn appeared 
2351,i called my men together and addressed them 
2352,my loyal friends  stay here  the rest of you  while with my boat and crew i go to check who those men are  find out if they are wild  lawless aggressors  or the type to welcome strangers  and fear the gods 
2353,with that  i climbed on board and told my crew to come with me and then untie the cables of the ship 
2354,quickly they did so  sat along the benches  and struck the whitening water with their oars 
2355,the journey was not long 
2356,upon arrival  right at the edge of land  beside the sea  we saw a high cave overhung with laurel  the home of several herds of sheep and goats 
2357,around that cave was built a lofty courtyard  of deep set stones  with tall pines rising up  and leafy oaks 
2358,there lived a massive man who shepherded his flocks all by himself 
2359,he did not go to visit other people  but kept apart  and did not know the ways
2360,of custom 
2361,in his build he was a wonder  a giant  not like men who live on bread  but like a wooded peak in airy mountains  rising alone above the rest 
2362,i told my loyal crew to guard the ship  while i would go with just twelve chosen men  my favorites 
2363,i took a goatskin full of dark sweet wine that i was given by apollo s priest  maron the son of euanthes  who lived inside the shady grove on ismarus 
2364,in reverence to the god  i came to help him  and save his wife and son 
2365,he gave me gifts  a silver bowl and seven pounds of gold  well wrought  and siphoned off some sweet strong wine  and filled twelve jars for me a godlike drink 
2366,the slaves knew nothing of this wine  it was known just to him  his wife  and one house girl 
2367,whenever he was drinking it  he poured a single shot into a cup  and added twenty of water  and a marvelous smell
2368,rose from the bowl  and all would long to taste it 
2369,i filled a big skin up with it  and packed provisions in a bag my heart suspected that i might meet a man of courage  wild  and lacking knowledge of the normal customs 
2370,we soon were at the cave  but did not find the cyclops  he was pasturing his flocks 
2371,we went inside and looked at everything 
2372,we saw his crates weighed down with cheese  and pens crammed full of lambs divided up by age 
2373,the newborns  middlings  and those just weaned 
2374,there were well crafted bowls and pails for milking  all full of whey 
2375,my crew begged  let us grab some cheese and quickly drive the kids and lambs out of their pens and down to our swift ships  and sail away across the salty water  that would have been the better choice 
2376,but i refused 
2377,i hoped to see him  and find out if he would give us gifts 
2378,in fact he brought no joy to my companions 
2379,then we lit
2380,a fire  and made a sacrifice  and ate some cheese  and sat to wait inside the cave until he brought his flocks back home 
2381,he came at dinnertime  and brought a load of wood to make a fire 
2382,he hurled it noisily into the cave 
2383,we were afraid  and cowered towards the back 
2384,he drove his ewes and nannies inside to milk them  but he left the rams and he goats in the spacious yard outside 
2385,he lifted up the heavy stone and set it
2386,to block the entrance of the cave 
2387,it was a rock so huge and massive  twenty two strong carts could not have dragged it from the threshold 
2388,he sat  and all in order milked his ewes and she goats  then he set the lambs to suck beside each bleating mother 
2389,then he curdled half of the fresh white milk  set that aside in wicker baskets  and the rest he stored in pails so he could drink it with his dinner 
2390,when he had carefully performed his chores 
2391,he lit a fire  then looked around and saw us 
2392,strangers  who are you 
2393,where did you come from across the watery depths 
2394,are you on business  or roaming round without a goal  like pirates  who risk their lives at sea to bring disaster to other people 
2395,so he spoke 
2396,his voice  so deep and booming  and his giant size  made our hearts sink in terror 
2397,even so  i answered  we are greeks  come here from troy 
2398,the winds have swept us off in all directions
2399,across the vast expanse of sea  off course from our planned route back home 
2400,zeus willed it so 
2401,we are proud to be the men of agamemnon  the son of atreus  whose fame is greatest under the sky  for sacking that vast city and killing many people 
2402,now we beg you  here at your knees  to grant a gift  as is the norm for hosts and guests 
2403,please sir  my lord  respect the gods 
2404,we are your suppliants  and zeus is on our side  since he takes care
2405,of visitors  guest friends  and those in need 
2406,unmoved he said  well  foreigner  you are a fool  or from some very distant country 
2407,you order me to fear the gods  my people think nothing of that zeus with his big scepter  nor any god  our strength is more than theirs 
2408,if i spare you or spare your friends  it will not be out of fear of zeus 
2409,i do the bidding of my own heart 
2410,but are you going far in that fine ship of yours  or somewhere near 
2411,he spoke to test me  but i saw right through him 
2412,i know how these things work 
2413,i answered him deceitfully 
2414,poseidon  the earth shaker  shipwrecked me at the far end of your island 
2415,he pushed us in  wind dashed us on the rocks 
2416,we barely managed to survive 
2417,but he made no reply and showed no mercy 
2418,leaping up high  he reached his hands towards my men  seized two  and knocked them hard against the ground like puppies  and the floor was wet with brains 
2419,he ripped them limb by limb to make his meal  then ate them like a lion on the mountains  devouring flesh  entrails  and marrow bones  and leaving nothing 
2420,watching this disaster  we wept and lifted up our hands in prayer to zeus 
2421,we felt so helpless 
2422,when the cyclops had filled his massive belly with his meal of human meat and unmixed milk  he lay stretched out among his flocks 
2423,then thinking like a military man  i thought i should
2424,get out my sword  go up to him and thrust right through his torso  feeling for his liver 
2425,that would have doomed us all 
2426,on second thoughts  i realized we were too weak to move the mighty stone he set in the high doorway 
2427,so we stayed there in misery till dawn 
2428,early the dawn appeared  pink fingers blooming  and then he lit his fire and milked his ewes in turn  and set a lamb by every one 
2429,when he had diligently done his chores 
2430,he grabbed two men and made a meal of them 
2431,after he ate  he drove his fat flock out 
2432,he rolled the boulder out and back with ease  as one would set the lid upon a quiver 
2433,then whistling merrily  the cyclops drove his fat flocks to the mountain 
2434,i was left  scheming to take revenge on him and hurt him  and gain the glory  if athena let me  i made my plan 
2435,beside the pen there stood a great big club  green olive wood  which he
2436,had cut to dry  to be his walking stick 
2437,it was so massive that it looked to us like a ship s mast  a twenty oared black freighter that sails across the vast sea full of cargo 
2438,i went and cut from it about a fathom  and gave it to the men  and ordered them to scrape it down 
2439,they made it smooth and i stood by and sharpened up the tip  and made it hard in the blazing flame 
2440,the cave was full of dung  i hid the club beneath a pile 
2441,then i gave orders that the men cast lots for who would lift the stake with me and press it into his eye  when sweet sleep overtook him 
2442,the lots fell on the men i would have chosen  four men  and i was fifth among their number 
2443,at evening he drove back his woolly flocks into the spacious cave  both male and female  and left none in the yard outside perhaps suspecting something  or perhaps a god told him to do it 
2444,he picked up and placed
2445,the stone to form a door  and sat to milk the sheep and bleating goats in turn  then put the little ones to suck 
2446,his chores were done  he grabbed two men for dinner 
2447,i approached and offered him a cup of ivy wood  filled full of wine 
2448,i said  here  cyclops  you have eaten human meat  now drink some wine  sample the merchandise our ship contains 
2449,i brought it as a holy offering  so you might pity me and send me home 
2450,but you are in a cruel rage  beyond what anyone could bear 
2451,do you expect more guests  when you have treated us so rudely 
2452,he took and drank the sweet delicious wine  he loved it  and demanded more 
2453,another  and now tell me your name  so i can give you a present as my guest  one you will like 
2454,my people do have wine  grape clusters grow from our rich earth  fed well by rain from zeus 
2455,but this is nectar  god food  so i gave him
2456,another cup of wine  and then two more 
2457,he drank them all  unwisely 
2458,with the wine gone to his head  i told him  all politeness  cyclops  you asked my name 
2459,i will reveal it  then you must give the gift you promised me  of hospitality 
2460,my name is noman 
2461,my family and friends all call me noman 
2462,he answered with no pity in his heart  i will eat noman last  first i will eat the other men 
2463,that is my gift to you 
2464,then he collapsed  fell on his back  and lay there  his massive neck askew 
2465,all conquering sleep took him 
2466,in drunken heaviness  he spewed wine from his throat  and chunks of human flesh 
2467,and then i drove the spear into the embers to heat it up  and told my men  be brave  i wanted none of them to shrink in fear 
2468,the fire soon seized the olive spear  green though it was  and terribly it glowed 
2469,i quickly snatched it from the fire 
2470,my crew
2471,stood firm  some god was breathing courage in us 
2472,they took the olive spear  its tip all sharp  and shoved it in his eye 
2473,i leaned on top and twisted it  as when a man drills wood for shipbuilding 
2474,below  the workers spin the drill with straps  stretched out from either end 
2475,so round and round it goes  and so we whirled the fire sharp weapon in his eye 
2476,his blood poured out around the stake  and blazing fire sizzled his lids and brows  and fried the roots 
2477,as when a blacksmith dips an axe or adze to temper it in ice cold water  loudly it shrieks 
2478,from this  the iron takes on its power 
2479,so did his eyeball crackle on the spear 
2480,horribly then he howled  the rocks resounded  and we shrank back in fear 
2481,he tugged the spear out of his eye  all soaked with gushing blood 
2482,desperately with both hands he hurled it from him  and shouted to the cyclopes who lived in caves high up on windy cliffs around 
2483,they heard and came from every side  and stood near to the cave  and called out  polyphemus  what is the matter 
2484,are you badly hurt 
2485,why are you screaming through the holy night and keeping us awake 
2486,is someone stealing your herds  or trying to kill you  by some trick or force 
2487,strong polyphemus from inside replied  my friends  noman is killing me by tricks  not force 
2488,their words flew back to him  if no one hurts you  you are all alone 
2489,great zeus has made you sick  no help for that 
2490,pray to your father  mighty lord poseidon 
2491,then off they went  and i laughed to myself  at how my name  the no man maneuver  tricked him 
2492,the cyclops groaned and labored in his pain  felt with blind hands and took the door stone out  and sat there at the entrance  arms outstretched  to catch whoever went out with the sheep 
2493,maybe he thought i was a total fool 
2494,but i was strategizing  hatching plans 
2495,so that my men and i could all survive 
2496,i wove all kinds of wiles and cunning schemes  danger was near and it was life or death 
2497,the best idea i formed was this  there were those well fed sturdy rams with good thick fleece  wool as dark as violets all fine big creatures 
2498,so silently i tied them with the rope used by the giant cyclops as a bed 
2499,i bound the rams in sets of three and set a man beneath each middle sheep  with one
2500,on either side  and so my men were saved 
2501,one ram was best of all the flock  i grabbed his back and curled myself up underneath his furry belly  clinging to his fleece  by force of will i kept on hanging there 
2502,and then we waited miserably for day 
2503,when early dawn revealed her rose red hands  the rams jumped up  all eager for the grass 
2504,the ewes were bleating in their pens  unmilked  their udders full to bursting 
2505,though their master
2506,was weak and worn with pain  he felt the back of each ram as he lined them up but missed the men tied up beneath their woolly bellies 
2507,last of them all  the big ram went outside  heavy with wool and me the clever trickster 
2508,strong polyphemus stroked his back and asked him  sweet ram  why are you last today to leave the cave 
2509,you are not normally so slow 
2510,you are the first to eat the tender flowers  leaping across the meadow  first to drink 
2511,and first to want to go back to the sheepfold at evening time 
2512,but now you are the last 
2513,you grieve for master s eye  that wicked man  helped by his nasty henchmen  got me drunk and blinded me  noman will not escape  if only you could talk like me  and tell me where he is skulking in his fear of me  then i would dash his brains out on the rocks  and make them spatter all across the cave  to ease the pain that no good noman brought 
2514,with that  he nudged the ram away outside 
2515,we rode a short way from the cave  then i first freed myself and then untied my men 
2516,we stole his nice fat animals  and ran  constantly glancing all around and back until we reached the ship 
2517,the other men were glad to see us  their surviving friends  but wept for those who died 
2518,i ordered them to stop their crying  scowling hard at each 
2519,i made them shove the fleecy flock on board 
2520,and row the boat out into salty water 
2521,so they embarked  sat on their rowing benches  and struck their oar blades in the whitening sea 
2522,when i had gone as far as shouts can carry  i jeered back  hey  you  cyclops  idiot  the crew trapped in your cave did not belong to some poor weakling 
2523,well  you had it coming  you had no shame at eating your own guests  so zeus and other gods have paid you back 
2524,my taunting made him angrier 
2525,he ripped
2526,a rock out of the hill and hurled it at us 
2527,it landed right in front of our dark prow  and almost crushed the tip of the steering oar 
2528,the stone sank in the water  waves surged up 
2529,the backflow all at once propelled the ship landwards  the swollen water pushed us with it 
2530,i grabbed a big long pole  and shoved us off 
2531,i told my men  row fast  to save your lives  and gestured with my head to make them hurry 
2532,they bent down to their oars and started rowing 
2533,we got out twice as far across the sea  and then i called to him again 
2534,my crew begged me to stop  and pleaded with me  please  calm down  why are you being so insistent and taunting this wild man 
2535,he hurled that stone and drove our ship right back to land 
2536,we thought that we were going to die 
2537,if he had heard us  he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and wooden ship 
2538,he throws so hard  but my tough heart was not convinced  i was
2539,still furious  and shouted back again  cyclops  if any mortal asks you how your eye was mutilated and made blind  say that odysseus  the city sacker  laertes son  who lives in ithaca  destroyed your sight 
2540,he groaned  the prophecy  it has come true at last  there was a tall and handsome man named telemus  the son of eurymus  who lived among my people  he spent his life here  soothsaying for us 
2541,he told me that odysseus hands would make me lose my sight 
2542,i always thought a tall and handsome man would visit me  endowed with strength and courage 
2543,but this weakling  this little nobody  has blinded me  by wine he got the best of me  come on  odysseus  and let me give you gifts  and ask poseidon s help to get you home 
2544,i am his son  the god is proud to be my father 
2545,he will heal me  if he wants 
2546,though no one else  not god nor man  can do it 
2547,after he said these words  i answered him  if only i could steal your life from you  and send you down to hades house below  as sure as nobody will ever heal you  even the god of earthquakes 
2548,but he prayed holding his arms towards the starry sky  listen  earth shaker  blue haired lord poseidon  acknowledge me your son  and be my father 
2549,grant that odysseus  the city sacker 
2550,will never go back home 
2551,or if it is fated that he will see his family  then let him get there late and with no honor  in pain and lacking ships  and having caused the death of all his men  and let him find more trouble in his own house 
2552,blue poseidon granted his son s prayer 
2553,polyphemus raised a rock far bigger than the last  and swung  then hurled it with immeasurable force 
2554,it fell a little short  beside our rudder 
2555,and splashed into the sea  the waves surged up  and pushed the boat ahead  to the other shore 
2556,we reached the island where our ships were docked 
2557,the men were sitting waiting for us  weeping 
2558,we beached our ship and disembarked  then took the sheep that we had stolen from the cyclops out of the ship s hold  and we shared them out fairly  so all the men got equal portions 
2559,but in dividing up the flock  my crew gave me alone the ram  the cyclops favorite 
2560,there on the shore  i slaughtered him for zeus  the son of cronus  god of dark clouds  lord of all the world 
2561,i burned the thighs 
2562,the god ignored my offering  and planned to ruin all of my ships and all my loyal men 
2563,so all day long till sunset we were sitting  feasting on meat and drinking sweet strong wine 
2564,but when the sun went down and darkness fell  we went to sleep beside the breaking waves 
2565,then when rose fingered dawn came  bright and early 
2566,i roused my men and told them to embark and loose the cables 
2567,quickly they obeyed  sat at their rowing benches  all in order  and struck the gray saltwater with their oars 
2568,so we sailed on  with sorrow in our hearts  glad to survive  but grieving for our friends 
2569,the winds and the witch we reached the floating island of aeolus  who is well loved by all the deathless gods 
2570,around it  on sheer cliffs  there runs a wall of solid bronze  impregnable 
2571,twelve children live with him in his palace  six strong boys  and six girls 
2572,he arranged their marriages  one sister to each brother 
2573,they are always feasting there with their parents  at a banquet that never ends 
2574,by day  the savor fills the house  the court reverberates with sound 
2575,at night they sleep beside the wives they love on rope beds piled with blankets 
2576,we arrived at that fine citadel 
2577,he welcomed me and made me stay a month  and asked for news of troy  the argive ships  and how the greeks went home 
2578,i told him everything 
2579,at last i told him he should send me on my way 
2580,so he agreed to help me  and he gave me a bag of oxhide leather and he tied the gusty winds inside it 
2581,zeus  the son
2582,of cronus  made him steward of the winds  and he can stop or rouse them as he wishes 
2583,he bound the bag with shining silver wire to my curved ship  so no gust could escape  however small  and he made zephyr blow so that the breath could carry home our ships and us 
2584,but it was not to be 
2585,our folly ruined us 
2586,for nine days and nights we sailed  and on the tenth  our native land appeared 
2587,we were so near  we saw men tending fires 
2588,exhausted  i let sweet sleep overcome me  i had been doing all the steering  hoping that we would get home sooner if i did 
2589,but while i slept my men began to mutter  saying the great aeolus gave me gifts silver and gold that i was taking home 
2590,with glances to his neighbor  each complained  it seems that everybody loves this man  and honors him  in every place we sail to 
2591,he also has that loot from sacking troy 
2592,we shared the journey with him  yet we come back home with empty hands 
2593,and now aeolus has made this friendly gift to him 
2594,so hurry  we should look in the bag  and see how much is in there how much silver  how much gold 
2595,that bad idea took hold of them  they did it 
2596,they opened up the bag  and all the winds rushed out at once 
2597,a sudden buffet seized us and hurled us back to sea  the wrong direction  far from our home 
2598,they screamed and i woke up 
2599,and wondered if i should jump off the ship and drown  or bite my lip  be stoical  and stay among the living 
2600,i endured it  covered my face  and lay on deck 
2601,a blast of storm wind whooshed the ships back to the island of great aeolus 
2602,they began to weep 
2603,we disembarked and filled our jars with water  and hungrily the men devoured their dinner 
2604,when they were done  i took one slave with me and one crew member  back to see aeolus 
2605,he was at dinner with his wife and children 
2606,we entered and sat down beside the doorposts 
2607,startled  they asked  why are you here again 
2608,you had bad luck 
2609,what happened 
2610,surely we helped you go on your way  and meant for you to reach your homeland  where you wished to go 
2611,i answered sadly  blame my men  and blame my stubborn urge to sleep  which ruined us 
2612,dear friends  you have the power to put things right 
2613,i hoped these words would soften them  but they
2614,were silent 
2615,then the father yelled  get out  you nasty creature  leave my island  now  it is not right for me to help convey a man so deeply hated by the gods 
2616,you godforsaken thing  how dare you come here 
2617,get out  he roared and drove us from his palace 
2618,dispirited  we sailed away 
2619,the men grew worn out with the agony of rowing  our folly had deprived us of fair winds 
2620,we rowed six days and nights  the seventh day
2621,we came to laestrygonia the town of telepylus upon the cliffs of lamos 
2622,a herdsman there  returning to his home  can greet another herdsman going out 
2623,a sleepless man could earn a double wage by herding cows  then pasturing white sheep the paths of day and night are close together 
2624,we reached the famous harbor  all surrounded by sheer rock cliffs 
2625,on each side  strips of shore jut out and almost meet  a narrow mouth 
2626,no waves rear up in there  not even small ones 
2627,white calm is everywhere 
2628,so all the others harbored their ships inside  crammed close together 
2629,i was the only one who chose to moor my ship outside the harbor  fastening the cables to a rock a way away 
2630,i disembarked and climbed a crag to scout 
2631,i saw no sign of cattle or of humans  except some smoke that rose up from the earth 
2632,i picked two men  and one slave as the third 
2633,and sent them to find out what people lived and ate bread in this land 
2634,they disembarked and walked along a smooth path  where the wagons brought wood down from the mountains to the city 
2635,they met a girl in front of town  out fetching some water 
2636,she was heading for the fountain of artaky  the whole town s water source 
2637,she was the strapping child of antiphates  king of the laestrygonians 
2638,they asked her about the king and people of the country 
2639,she promptly took them to the high roofed palace of her own father 
2640,when they went inside they found a woman  mountain high 
2641,they were appalled and shocked 
2642,the giantess at once summoned the king her husband from the council  he tried to kill my men  and grabbing one he ate him up 
2643,the other two escaped  back to the ship 
2644,the king s shout boomed through town 
2645,hearing  the mighty laestrygonians thronged from all sides  not humanlike  but giants 
2646,with boulders bigger than a man could lift they pelted at us from the cliffs 
2647,we heard the dreadful uproar of ships being broken and dying men 
2648,they speared them there like fish 
2649,a gruesome meal  while they were killing them inside the harbor  i drew out my sword and cut the ropes that moored my dark cheeked ship  and yelling to my men  i told them  row as fast as possible away from danger  they rowed at double time  afraid to die 
2650,my ship was lucky and we reached the sea beyond the overhanging cliffs 
2651,the rest  trapped in the bay together  were destroyed 
2652,we sailed off sadly  happy to survive  but with our good friends lost 
2653,we reached aeaea  home of the beautiful  dreadful goddess circe  who speaks in human languages the sister of aeetes whose mind is set on ruin 
2654,those two are children of the sun who shines on mortals  and of perse  child of ocean 
2655,under the guidance of some god we drifted silently to the harbor  and we moored there 
2656,for two days and two nights we lay onshore  exhausted and our hearts consumed with grief 
2657,on the third morning brought by braided dawn  i took my spear and sharp sword  and i ran up from the ship to higher ground  to look for signs of humans  listening for voices 
2658,i climbed up to a crag  and i saw smoke rising from circe s palace  from the earth
2659,up through the woods and thickets 
2660,i considered if i should go down and investigate  since i had seen the smoke 
2661,but i decided to go back down first  to the beach and ship and feed my men  and then set out to scout 
2662,when i had almost reached my ship  some god took pity on me in my loneliness  and sent a mighty stag with great tall antlers to cross my path 
2663,he ran down from the forest to drink out of the river  it was hot 
2664,i struck him in the middle of his back  my bronze spear pierced him 
2665,with a moan  he fell onto the dust  his spirit flew away 
2666,i stepped on him and tugged my bronze spear out  and left it on the ground  while i plucked twigs and twines  and wove a rope  a fathom s length  well knotted all the way along  and bound the hooves of that huge animal 
2667,i went down to my dark ship with him on my back 
2668,i used my spear to lean on  since the stag
2669,was too big to be lugged across one shoulder 
2670,i dumped him down before the ship and made a comforting pep talk to cheer my men 
2671,my friends  we will not yet go down to hades  sad though we are  before our fated day 
2672,come on  since we have food and drink on board  let us not starve ourselves  now time to eat  they quickly heeded my commands  and took their cloaks down from their faces  and they marveled to see the big stag lying on the beach 
2673,it was enormous 
2674,when they finished staring  they washed their hands and cooked a splendid meal 
2675,so all that day till sunset we sat eating the meat aplenty and the strong sweet wine 
2676,when darkness fell  we went to sleep beside the seashore 
2677,then the roses of dawn s fingers appeared again  i called my men and told them  listen to me  my friends  despite your grief 
2678,we do not know where darkness lives  nor dawn  nor where the sun that shines upon the world
2679,goes underneath the earth  nor where it rises 
2680,we need a way to fix our current plight  but i do not know how 
2681,i climbed the rocks to higher ground to look around 
2682,this is an island  wreathed about by boundless sea 
2683,the land lies low 
2684,i saw smoke in the middle  rising up through the forest and thick bush 
2685,at that  their hearts sank  since they all remembered what happened with the laestrygonians  their king antiphates  and how the mighty
2686,cyclops devoured the men 
2687,they wept and wailed  and she would great floods of tears 
2688,but all that grieving could do no good 
2689,i made them wear their armor  and split them in two groups 
2690,i led one  and made godlike eurylochus lead the other 
2691,we shook the lots in a helmet made of bronze  eurylochus lot jumped out 
2692,so he went with his band of twenty two  all weeping 
2693,those left behind with me were crying too 
2694,inside the glade they found the house of circe
2695,built out of polished stones  on high foundations 
2696,round it were mountain wolves and lions  which she tamed with drugs 
2697,they did not rush on them  but gathered around them in a friendly way  their long tails wagging  as dogs nuzzle round their master when he comes back home from dinner with treats for them 
2698,just so  those sharp clawed wolves and lions  mighty beasts  came snuggling up 
2699,the men were terrified 
2700,they stood outside and heard some lovely singing 
2701,it was circe 
2702,the goddess 
2703,she was weaving as she sang  an intricate  enchanting piece of work  the kind a goddess fashions 
2704,then polites  my most devoted and most loyal man  a leader to his peers  said  friends  inside someone is weaving on that massive loom  and singing so the floor resounds 
2705,perhaps a woman  or a goddess 
2706,let us call her 
2707,they shouted out to her 
2708,she came at once  opened the shining doors  and asked them in 
2709,so thinking nothing of it  in they went 
2710,eurylochus alone remained outside  suspecting trickery 
2711,she led them in  sat them on chairs  and blended them a potion of barley  cheese  and golden honey  mixed with pramnian wine 
2712,she added potent drugs to make them totally forget their home 
2713,they took and drank the mixture 
2714,then she struck them  using her magic wand  and penned them in the pigsty 
2715,they were turned to pigs in body
2716,and voice and hair  their minds remained the same 
2717,they squealed at their imprisonment  and circe threw them some mast and cornel cherries food that pigs like rooting for in muddy ground 
2718,eurylochus ran back to our black ship  to tell us of the terrible disaster that happened to his friends 
2719,he tried to speak  but could not  overwhelmed by grief 
2720,his eyes were full of tears  his heart was pierced with sorrow 
2721,astonished  we all questioned him 
2722,at last
2723,he spoke about what happened to the others 
2724,odysseus  we went off through the woods  as you commanded 
2725,in the glade we found a beautiful tall house of polished stone 
2726,we heard a voice  a woman or a goddess was singing as she worked her loom 
2727,my friends called out to her 
2728,she opened up the doors  inviting them inside 
2729,suspecting nothing  they followed her 
2730,but i stayed there outside  fearing some trick 
2731,then all at once  they vanished 
2732,i sat there for a while to watch and wait  but none of them came back 
2733,at this  i strapped my silver studded sword across my back  took up my bow  and told him  take me there 
2734,he grasped my knees and begged me tearfully  no no  my lord  please do not make me go  let me stay here  you cannot bring them back  and you will not return here if you try 
2735,hurry  we must escape with these men here  we have a chance to save our lives  i said 
2736,you can stay here beside the ship and eat and drink 
2737,but i will go 
2738,i must do this 
2739,i left the ship and shore  and walked on up  crossing the sacred glades  and i had almost reached the great house of the enchantress circe  when i met hermes  carrying his wand of gold 
2740,he seemed an adolescent boy  the cutest age  when beards first start to grow 
2741,he took my hand and said  why have you come across these hills alone 
2742,you do not know
2743,this place  poor man  your men were turned to pigs in circe s house  and crammed in pens 
2744,do you imagine you can set them free 
2745,you cannot 
2746,if you try that  you will not get back home 
2747,you will stay here with them 
2748,but i can help you 
2749,here  take this antidote to keep you safe when you go into circe s house 
2750,now i will tell you all her lethal spells and tricks 
2751,she will make you a potion mixed with poison 
2752,its magic will not work on you because
2753,you have the herb i gave you 
2754,when she strikes you with her long wand  then draw your sharpened sword and rush at her as if you mean to kill her 
2755,she will be frightened of you  and will tell you to sleep with her 
2756,do not hold out against her she is a goddess 
2757,if you sleep with her  you will set free your friends and save yourself 
2758,tell her to swear an oath by all the gods that she will not plot further harm for you or while you have your clothes off  she may hurt you 
2759,unmanning you 
2760,the bright mercurial god pulled from the ground a plant and showed me how its root is black  its flower white as milk 
2761,the gods call this plant moly 
2762,it is hard for mortal men to dig it up  but gods are able to do everything 
2763,then hermes flew through the wooded island  back towards high mount olympus 
2764,i went in the house of circe 
2765,my heart pounded as i walked 
2766,i stood there at the doorway  and i saw her 
2767,the lovely circe with her braided hair 
2768,i called  she heard and opened up the doors and asked me in 
2769,i followed nervously 
2770,she led me to a silver studded chair  all finely crafted  with a footstool under 
2771,in a gold cup she mixed a drink for me  adding the drug she hoped to do me harm 
2772,i sipped it  but the magic did not work 
2773,she struck me with her wand and said  now go  out to the sty  and lie there with your men 
2774,but i drew my sharp sword from by my thigh and leapt at her as if i meant to kill her 
2775,she screamed and ducked beneath the sword  and grasped my knees  and wailing asked me  who are you 
2776,where is your city 
2777,and who are your parents 
2778,i am amazed that you could drink my potion and yet not be bewitched 
2779,no other man has drunk it and withstood the magic charm 
2780,but you are different 
2781,your mind is not enchanted 
2782,you must be odysseus 
2783,the man who can adapt to anything 
2784,bright flashing hermes of the golden wand has often told me that you would sail here from troy in your swift ship 
2785,now sheathe your sword and come to bed with me  through making love we may begin to trust each other more 
2786,i answered  circe  how can you command me to treat you gently  when you turned my men to pigs  and you are planning to play tricks in telling me to come to bed with you 
2787,so you can take my courage and my manhood when you have got me naked 
2788,i refuse to come to bed with you  unless you swear a mighty oath that you will not form plans to hurt me anymore 
2789,when i said that  at once she made the oath as i had asked 
2790,she vowed and formed the oath  and then at last i went up to the dazzling bed of circe 
2791,meanwhile  four slaves  her house girls  were at work around the palace 
2792,they were nymphs  the daughters
2793,of fountains and of groves and holy rivers that flow into the sea 
2794,one set fine cloths of purple on the chairs  with stones beneath them 
2795,beside each chair  another pulled up tables of silver and set golden baskets on them 
2796,the third mixed up inside a silver bowl sweet  cheering wine  and poured it in gold cups 
2797,the fourth brought water  and she lit a fire beneath a mighty tripod  till it boiled 
2798,it started bubbling in the copper cauldron 
2799,she took me to the bathtub  and began to wash my head and shoulders  using water mixed to the perfect temperature  to take my deep soul crushing weariness away 
2800,after the bath  she oiled my skin and dressed me in fine wool cloak and tunic  and she led me to a silver studded well carved chair  and set a footstool underneath 
2801,another slave brought water for my hands  in a gold pitcher  and poured it over them  to a silver bowl 
2802,she set a polished table near 
2803,the cook brought bread and laid a generous feast  and circe told me to eat 
2804,but my heart was unwilling 
2805,i sat there with my mind on other things  i had forebodings 
2806,circe noticed me sitting  not touching food  and weighed by grief 
2807,she stood near me and asked  odysseus  why are you sitting there so silently  like someone mute  eating your heart  not touching the banquet or the wine 
2808,you need not fear 
2809,remember  i already swore an oath 
2810,but i said  circe  no  what decent man could bear to taste his food or sip his wine before he saw his men with his own eyes  and set them free 
2811,if you are so insistent on telling me to eat and drink  then free them  so i may see with my own eyes my crew of loyal men 
2812,so circe left the hall holding her wand  and opened up the pigsty and drove them out  still looking like fat boars 
2813,large and full grown 
2814,they stood in front of her 
2815,majestic lady circe walked among them  anointing each with some new drug 
2816,the potion had made thick hog hairs sprout out on their bodies 
2817,those bristles all flew off and they were men  but younger than before  and much more handsome  and taller 
2818,then they recognized me  each embraced me tightly in his arms  and started sobbing in desperation 
2819,so the house rang loud with noise  and even she herself
2820,pitied them 
2821,she came near to me and said  odysseus  you always find solutions 
2822,go now to your swift ship beside the sea 
2823,first drag the ship to land  and bring your stores and all your gear inside the caves 
2824,then come back with your loyal men 
2825,my heart agreed  i went down to my swift ship on the shore 
2826,i found my loyal men beside the ship  weeping and shedding floods of tears 
2827,as when a herd of cows is coming back from pasture
2828,into the yard  and all the little heifers jump from their pens to skip and run towards their mothers  and they cluster round them  mooing  just so my men  as soon as they saw me  began to weep  and in their minds it seemed as if they had arrived in their own home  the land of rugged ithaca  where they were born and raised 
2829,still sobbing  they cried out  oh  master  we are glad to see you back  it is as if we had come home ourselves 
2830,to ithaca  our fatherland 
2831,but tell us about how all our other friends were killed 
2832,i reassured them  saying  first we must drag up the ship to land  and put the stores and all our gear inside the caves  then hurry  all of you  come with me  and see your friends inside the goddess circe s holy house  eating and drinking  they have food enough to last forever 
2833,they believed my story  with the exception of eurylochus 
2834,who warned them  fools  why would you go up there 
2835,why would you choose to take on so much danger  to enter circe s house  where she will turn us to pigs or wolves or lions  all of us  forced to protect her mighty house for her 
2836,remember what the cyclops did 
2837,our friends went to his home with this rash lord of ours 
2838,because of his bad choices  they all died 
2839,at that  i thought of drawing my long sword from by my sturdy thigh  to cut his head off
2840,and let it fall down to the ground although he was close family 
2841,my men restrained me  saying to me  no  king  please let him go  let him stay here and guard the ship  and we will follow you to circe s holy house 
2842,so they went up  away from ship and shore 
2843,eurylochus did not stay there  he came  fearing my angry scolding 
2844,meanwhile circe had freed the other men  and in her house she gently bathed them  rubbing them with oil 
2845,she had them dressed in woolen cloaks and tunics 
2846,we found them feasting in the hall 
2847,the men  seeing each other face to face again  began to weep  their sobbing filled the hall 
2848,the goddess stood beside me and said  king  clever odysseus  laertes son  now stop encouraging this lamentation 
2849,i know you and your men have suffered greatly  out on the fish filled sea  and on dry land from hostile men 
2850,but it is time to eat
2851,and drink some wine 
2852,you must get back the drive you had when you set out from ithaca 
2853,you are worn down and brokenhearted  always dwelling on pain and wandering 
2854,you never feel joy at heart 
2855,you have endured too much 
2856,we did as she had said 
2857,then every day for a whole year we feasted there on meat and sweet strong wine 
2858,but when the year was over  when months had waned and seasons turned  and each long day had passed its course  my loyal men
2859,called me and said  be guided by the gods 
2860,now it is time to think of our own country  if you are fated to survive and reach your high roofed house and your forefathers land 
2861,my warrior soul agreed 
2862,so all day long till sunset we kept sitting at the feast of meat and sweet strong wine 
2863,but when the sun set  and the darkness came  they went to bed all through the shadowy palace 
2864,i went up to circe s splendid bed  and touched her knees
2865,in supplication  and the goddess listened 
2866,circe  i said  fulfill the vow you made to send me home 
2867,my heart now longs to go 
2868,my men are also desperate to leave 
2869,whenever you are absent  they exhaust me with constant lamentation 
2870,and she answered  laertes son  great king odysseus  master of every challenge  you need not remain here in my house against your will 
2871,but first you must complete another journey 
2872,go to the house of hades and the dreadful persephone  and ask the theban prophet  the blind tiresias  for his advice 
2873,persephone has given him alone full understanding  even now in death 
2874,the other spirits flit around as shadows 
2875,that broke my heart  and sitting on the bed i wept  and lost all will to live and see the shining sun 
2876,when i was done with sobbing and rolling round in grief  i said to her 
2877,but circe  who can guide us on this journey 
2878,no one before has ever sailed to hades by ship 
2879,and right away the goddess answered  you are resourceful  king odysseus 
2880,you need not worry that you have no pilot to steer your ship 
2881,set up your mast  let fly your white sails  and sit down 
2882,the north wind s breath will blow the ship 
2883,when you have crossed the stream of ocean  you will reach the shore  where willows let fall their dying fruit  and towering poplars
2884,grow in the forest of persephone 
2885,tie up your ship in the deep eddying ocean  and go into the spacious home of hades 
2886,the pyriphlegethon and cocytus  a tributary of the styx  both run into the acheron 
2887,the flowing water resounds beside the rock 
2888,brave man  go there  and dig a hole a cubit wide and long  and round it pour libations for the dead  first honey mix  then sweet wine  and the third
2889,of water 
2890,sprinkle barley  and beseech the spirits of the dead 
2891,vow if you reach the barren land of ithaca  to kill a heifer in your halls  the best you have  uncalved  and you will heap the fire with meat  and offer to tiresias alone a ram  pure black  the best of all your flock 
2892,when you have prayed to all the famous dead  slaughter one ram and one black ewe  directing the animals to erebus  but turn
2893,yourself away  towards the gushing river 
2894,many will come 
2895,then tell your men to skin the sheep that lie there killed by ruthless bronze  and burn them  with a prayer to mighty hades and terrible persephone 
2896,then draw your sword and sit 
2897,do not let them come near the blood  until you hear tiresias 
2898,the prophet will soon come  and he will tell you about your journey  measured out across the fish filled sea  and how you will get home 
2899,dawn on her golden throne began to shine  and circe dressed me in my cloak and tunic 
2900,the goddess wore a long white dress  of fine and delicate fabric  with a golden belt  and on her head  a veil 
2901,then i walked round  all through the house  and called my men 
2902,i stood beside each one  and roused them with my words 
2903,wake up  now no more dozing in sweet sleep 
2904,we have to go 
2905,the goddess gave instructions 
2906,they did as i had said 
2907,but even then
2908,i could not lead my men away unharmed 
2909,the youngest one elpenor was his name not very brave in war  nor very smart  was lying high up in the home of circe  apart from his companions  seeking coolness since he was drunk 
2910,he heard the noise and bustle  the movements of his friends  and jumped up quickly  forgetting to climb down the lofty ladder 
2911,he fell down crashing headlong from the roof  and broke his neck  right at the spine 
2912,his spirit
2913,went down to hades 
2914,then i told the others  perhaps you think that you are going home 
2915,but circe says we have to go towards the house of hades and persephone  to meet tiresias  the theban spirit 
2916,at that  their hearts were broken 
2917,they sat down right there and wept and tore their clothes 
2918,but all their lamentation did no good 
2919,we went down to our speedy ship beside the sea  despite our grief 
2920,we she would abundant tears 
2921,then circe came and tied up one black ewe and one ram by the ship  and slipped away  easily  who can see the gods go by unless they wish to show themselves to us 
2922,the dead we reached the sea and first of all we launched the ship into the sparkling salty water  set up the mast and sails  and brought the sheep on board with us 
2923,we were still grieving  weeping  in floods of tears 
2924,but beautiful  dread circe  the goddess who can speak in human tongues  sent us a wind to fill our sails  fair wind befriending us behind the dark blue prow 
2925,we made our tackle shipshape  then sat down 
2926,the wind and pilot guided straight our course 
2927,the sun set 
2928,it was dark in all directions 
2929,we reached the limits of deep flowing ocean  where the cimmerians live and have their city 
2930,their land is covered up in mist and cloud  the shining sun god never looks on them with his bright beams not when he rises up into the starry sky  nor when he turns back from the heavens to earth 
2931,destructive night blankets the world for all poor mortals there 
2932,we beached our ship  drove out the sheep  and went
2933,to seek the stream of ocean where the goddess had told us we must go 
2934,eurylochus and perimedes made the sacrifice 
2935,i drew my sword and dug a hole  a fathom widthways and lengthways  and i poured libations for all the dead  first honey mix  sweet wine  and lastly  water 
2936,on the top  i sprinkled barley  and made a solemn vow that if i reached my homeland  i would sacrifice my best young heifer  still uncalved  and pile
2937,the altar high with offerings for the dead 
2938,i promised for tiresias as well a pure black sheep  the best in all my flock 
2939,so with these vows  i called upon the dead 
2940,i took the sheep and slit their throats above the pit 
2941,black blood flowed out 
2942,the spirits came up out of erebus and gathered round 
2943,teenagers  girls and boys  the old who suffered for many years  and fresh young brides whom labor destroyed in youth  and many men cut down
2944,in battle by bronze spears  still dressed in armor stained with their blood 
2945,from every side they crowded around the pit  with eerie cries 
2946,pale fear took hold of me  i roused my men and told them to flay the sheep that i had killed  and burn them  and pray to hades and persephone 
2947,i drew my sword and sat on guard  preventing the spirits of the dead from coming near the blood  till i had met tiresias 
2948,first came the spirit of my man elpenor 
2949,who had not yet been buried in the earth 
2950,we left his body in the house of circe without a funeral or burial  we were too occupied with other things 
2951,on sight of him  i wept in pity  saying  elpenor  how did you come here  in darkness 
2952,you came on foot more quickly than i sailed 
2953,he groaned in answer  lord odysseus  you master every circumstance 
2954,but i had bad luck from some god  and too much wine
2955,befuddled me  in circe s house i lay upstairs  and i forgot to use the ladder to climb down from the roof 
2956,i fell headfirst  my neck was broken from my spine 
2957,my spirit came down to hades 
2958,by the men you left  the absent ones  and by your wife  and father  who brought you up from babyhood  and by your son  telemachus  whom you abandoned alone at home  i beg you  when you sail from hades and you dock your ship again
2959,at aeaea  please my lord  remember me  do not go on and leave me there unburied  abandoned  without tears or lamentation or you will make the gods enraged at you 
2960,burn me with all my arms  and heap a mound beside the gray salt sea  so in the future people will know of me and my misfortune 
2961,and fix into the tomb the oar i used to row with my companions while i lived 
2962,poor man  i answered  i will do all this 
2963,we sat there talking sadly i on one side held firm my sword in blood  while on the other the ghost of my crew member made his speech 
2964,then came the spirit of my own dead mother  autolycus daughter anticleia  whom i had left alive when i went off to holy troy 
2965,on seeing her  i wept in pity 
2966,but despite my bitter grief  i would not let her near the blood till i talked to tiresias 
2967,the prophet came
2968,holding a golden scepter  and he knew me  and said  king under zeus  odysseus  adept survivor  why did you abandon the sun  poor man  to see the dead  and this place without joy 
2969,step back now from the pit  hold up your sharp sword so that i may drink the blood and speak to you 
2970,at that  i sheathed my silver studded sword 
2971,when he had drunk the murky blood  the famous prophet spoke 
2972,odysseus  you think of going home
2973,as honey sweet  but gods will make it bitter 
2974,i think poseidon will not cease to feel incensed because you blinded his dear son 
2975,you have to suffer  but you can get home  if you control your urges and your men 
2976,turn from the purple depths and sail your ship towards the island of thrinacia  there you will find grazing cows and fine fat sheep  belonging to the god who sees and hears all things the sun god 
2977,if you leave them be 
2978,keeping your mind fixed on your journey home  you may still get to ithaca  despite great losses 
2979,but if you hurt those cows  i see disaster for your ship and for your men 
2980,if you yourself escape  you will come home late and exhausted  in a stranger s boat  having destroyed your men 
2981,and you will find invaders eating your supplies at home  courting your wife with gifts 
2982,then you will match the suitors violence and kill them all 
2983,inside your halls  through tricks or in the open  with sharp bronze weapons 
2984,when those men are dead  you have to go away and take an oar to people with no knowledge of the sea  who do not salt their food 
2985,they never saw a ship s red prow  nor oars  the wings of boats 
2986,i prophesy the signs of things to come 
2987,when you meet somebody  a traveler  who calls the thing you carry on your back a winnowing fan  then fix that oar in earth
2988,and make fine sacrifices to poseidon a bull and stud boar 
2989,then you will go home and offer holy hecatombs to all the deathless gods who live in heaven  each in order 
2990,gentle death will come to you  far from the sea  of comfortable old age  your people flourishing 
2991,so it will be 
2992,i said  tiresias  i hope the gods spin out this fate for me  but tell me this  and tell the truth 
2993,i saw my mother s spirit 
2994,sitting in silence near the blood  refusing even to talk to me  or meet my eyes  my lord  how can i make her recognize that it is me 
2995,at once he made his answer 
2996,that is an easy matter to explain 
2997,whenever you allow one of these spirits to come here near the blood  it will be able to speak the truth to you 
2998,as soon as you push them away  they have to leave again 
2999,with that  tiresias  the prophet spirit 
3000,was finished  he departed to the house of hades 
3001,i stayed rooted there in place until my mother came and drank the blood 
3002,she knew me then and spoke in tones of grief 
3003,my child  how did you come here through the darkness while you were still alive 
3004,this place is hard for living men to see 
3005,there are great rivers and dreadful gulfs  including the great ocean which none can cross on foot  one needs a ship 
3006,have you come wandering here  so far from troy 
3007,with ship and crew 
3008,have you not yet arrived in ithaca  nor seen your wife at home 
3009,i answered  mother  i was forced to come to hades to consult the prophet spirit  theban tiresias 
3010,i have not yet come near to greece  nor reached my own home country 
3011,i have been lost and wretchedly unhappy since i first followed mighty agamemnon to troy  the land of horses  to make war upon the people there 
3012,but tell me  how
3013,was sad death brought upon you 
3014,by long illness 
3015,or did the archer artemis destroy you with gentle arrows 
3016,tell me too about my father and the son i left behind 
3017,are they still honored as the kings 
3018,or has another taken over  saying i will not return 
3019,and tell me what my wife is thinking  and her plans 
3020,does she stay with our son and focus on his care  or has the best of the achaeans married her 
3021,my mother answered  she stays firm 
3022,her heart is strong 
3023,she is still in your house 
3024,and all her nights are passed in misery  and days in tears 
3025,but no one has usurped your throne 
3026,telemachus still tends the whole estate unharmed and feasts in style  as lords should do  and he is always asked to council meetings 
3027,your father stays out in the countryside 
3028,he will not come to town 
3029,he does not sleep on a real bed with blankets and fresh sheets 
3030,in winter he sleeps inside  by the fire  just lying in the ashes with the slaves  his clothes are rags 
3031,in summer and at harvest  the piles of fallen leaves are beds for him 
3032,he lies there grieving  full of sorrow  longing for your return 
3033,his old age is not easy 
3034,and that is why i met my fate and died 
3035,the goddess did not shoot me in my home  aiming with gentle arrows 
3036,nor did sickness suck all the strength out from my limbs  with long
3037,and cruel wasting 
3038,no  it was missing you  odysseus  my sunshine  your sharp mind  and your kind heart 
3039,that took sweet life from me  then in my heart i wanted to embrace the spirit of my mother 
3040,she was dead  and i did not know how 
3041,three times i tried  longing to touch her 
3042,but three times her ghost flew from my arms  like shadows or like dreams 
3043,sharp pain pierced deeper in me as i cried  no  mother  why do you not stay for me 
3044,and let me hold you  even here in hades 
3045,let us wrap loving arms around each other and find a frigid comfort in shared tears  but is this really you 
3046,or has the queen sent me a phantom  to increase my grief 
3047,she answered  oh  my child  you are the most unlucky man alive 
3048,persephone is not deceiving you 
3049,this is the rule for mortals when we die 
3050,our muscles cease to hold the flesh and skeleton together 
3051,as soon as life departs from our white bones  the force of blazing fire destroys the corpse 
3052,the spirit flies away and soon is gone  just like a dream 
3053,now hurry to the light  remember all these things  so you may tell your wife in times to come 
3054,as we were talking  some women came  sent by persephone the daughters and the wives of warriors 
3055,they thronged and clustered round the blood 
3056,i wanted to speak to each of them  and made a plan 
3057,i drew my sword and would not let them come together in a group to drink the blood 
3058,they took turns coming forward  and each told her history  i questioned each 
3059,the first was well born tyro  child of salmoneus  and wife of cretheus  aeolus son 
3060,she fell in love with river enipeus  most handsome of all rivers that pour water over the earth 
3061,she often went to visit his lovely streams 
3062,poseidon took his form 
3063,and at the river mouth he lay with her 
3064,around them arched a dark blue wave that stood high as a mountain  and it hid the god and mortal woman 
3065,there he loosed her belt and made her sleep 
3066,the god made love to her  and afterwards  he took her hand and spoke 
3067,woman  be glad about this love 
3068,you will bear glorious children in the coming year 
3069,affairs with gods always result in offspring 
3070,look after them and raise them 
3071,now go home 
3072,tell no one who i am 
3073,but i will tell you 
3074,i am poseidon  shaker of the earth 
3075,with that he sank beneath the ocean waves 
3076,she brought two sons to term  named pelias and neleus  both sturdy boys who served almighty zeus  and pelias home was on the spacious dancing fields of iolcus  where sheep are plentiful  his brother lived in sandy pylos 
3077,and she bore more sons  to cretheus  aeson  pheres  amythaeon
3078,who loved war chariots 
3079,and after her i saw antiope  who said she slept in zeus arms and bore two sons  amphion and zethus  the first settlers of thebes  city of seven gates 
3080,strong though they were  they could not live there on the open plain without defenses 
3081,then i saw alcmene  wife of amphitryon  who by great zeus conceived the lionhearted heracles 
3082,and i saw megara  proud creon s child 
3083,the wife of tireless heracles 
3084,i saw fine epicaste  oedipus mother  who did a dreadful thing in ignorance  she married her own son 
3085,he killed his father  and married her 
3086,the gods revealed the truth to humans  through their deadly plans  he ruled the cadmeans in thebes  despite his pain 
3087,but epicaste crossed the gates of hades  she tied a noose and hung it from the ceiling  and hanged herself for sorrow  leaving him
3088,the agonies a mother s furies bring 
3089,then i saw chloris  who was youngest daughter of amphion  who ruled the minyans in orchomenus 
3090,she was beautiful  and neleus paid rich bride gifts for her 
3091,she was the queen in pylos  and she bore chromius  nestor  periclymenus  and mighty pyro  who was such a marvel that all the men desired to marry her 
3092,but neleus would only let her marry
3093,a man who could drive off the stubborn cattle of iphicles from phylace 
3094,the prophet melampus was the only one who tried  but gods restrained him  cursing him  the herdsmen shackled him 
3095,days and months went by  the seasons changed as the year went by  until at last iphicles set him free as his reward for prophecy 
3096,the will of zeus was done 
3097,and then i saw tyndareus wife  leda  who bore him two strong sons  the horseman
3098,castor  and polydeuces  skillful boxer 
3099,life giving earth contains them  still alive 
3100,zeus honors them even in the underworld 
3101,they live and die alternately  and they are honored like the gods 
3102,and then i saw iphimedeia  wife of aloeus  who proudly said poseidon slept with her 
3103,she had two sons whose lives were both cut short  otus and famous ephialtes  whom the fertile earth raised up as the tallest heroes
3104,after renowned orion 
3105,at nine years  they were nine cubits wide  nine fathoms high 
3106,they brought the din of dreadful raging war to the immortal gods and tried to set ossa and pelion trees  leaves and all on mount olympus  high up in the sky 
3107,they might have managed it  if they had reached full adulthood 
3108,apollo  son of zeus by braided leto  killed them  they were both dead before down could grow on their young chins 
3109,dead before beards could wreathe their naked faces 
3110,then i saw phaedra  procris  and the lovely daughter of dangerous minos  ariadne 
3111,theseus tried to bring her back from crete to athens  but could not succeed  the goddess artemis killed her on the isle of d a  when dionysus spoke against her 
3112,then came maera  clymene and eriphyle  accepting golden bribes  she killed her husband 
3113,i cannot name each famous wife and daughter
3114,i saw there  holy night would pass away before i finished 
3115,i must go to sleep on board the ship beside my crew  or else right here 
3116,i know the gods and you will help my onward journey 
3117,they were silent  spellbound  listening in the shadowy hall 
3118,white armed arete spoke 
3119,phaeacians  look at him  what a tall  handsome man  and what a mind  he is my special guest  but all of you share in our rank as lords  so do not send him
3120,away too fast  and when he leaves  you must be generous 
3121,he is in need  and you are rich in treasure  through the will of gods 
3122,the veteran echeneus  the oldest man in their company  said  our wise queen has hit the mark  my friends 
3123,do as she says 
3124,but first alcinous must speak and act 
3125,the king said  let it be as she has spoken  as long as i am ruler of this nation of seafarers 
3126,i know our guest is keen
3127,to go back home  but let him stay till morning 
3128,i will give all his presents then 
3129,you men will all help him  but i will help the most  since i hold power here 
3130,odysseus answered with careful tact  alcinous  king over all the people  if you urged me to stay here for a year before you gave the parting gifts and sent me on my way  i would be happy 
3131,it would be far better to reach my own dear home with hands filled full
3132,of treasure 
3133,so all men would honor me and welcome me back home in ithaca 
3134,alcinous replied  odysseus  the earth sustains all different kinds of people 
3135,many are cheats and thieves  who fashion lies out of thin air 
3136,but when i look at you  i know you are not in that category 
3137,your story has both grace and wisdom in it 
3138,you sounded like a skillful poet  telling the sufferings of all the greeks  including
3139,what you endured yourself 
3140,but come now  tell me if you saw any spirits of your friends  who went with you to troy and undertook the grief and pain of war 
3141,the night is long  it is not time to sleep yet 
3142,tell me more amazing deeds  i would keep listening until bright daybreak  if you kept on telling the dangers you have passed 
3143,odysseus answered politely  king alcinous  it is a time for many tales  but also
3144,a time for sleep 
3145,if you still want to hear  i will not grudge you stories 
3146,i will tell you some even more distressing ones  about my friend who managed to escape the shrieks and battle din at troy but perished later  killed in his own home by an evil wife 
3147,holy persephone dispersed the ghosts of women and they went their separate ways 
3148,the ghost of agamemnon came in sorrow with all the rest who met their fate with him
3149,inside aegisthus house 
3150,he recognized me when he had drunk the blood 
3151,he wept out loud  and tearfully reached out his hands towards me  desperate to touch 
3152,his energy and strength and all the suppleness his limbs once had were gone 
3153,i wept and my heart pitied him 
3154,i cried out  lord of men  king agamemnon  how did you die 
3155,what bad luck brought you down 
3156,was it poseidon rousing up a blast of cruel wind to wreck your ships 
3157,or were you
3158,killed on dry land by enemies as you were poaching their fat flocks of sheep or cattle  or fighting for their city and their wives 
3159,he answered right away  king under zeus  odysseus survivor  no  poseidon did not rouse up a dreadful blast of wind to wreck my ship 
3160,no hostile men on land killed me in self defense 
3161,it was aegisthus who planned my death and murdered me  with help from my own wife 
3162,he called me to his house
3163,to dinner and he killed me  as one slaughters an ox at manger 
3164,what a dreadful death  my men were systematically slaughtered like pigs in a rich lord s house for some feast  a wedding or a banquet 
3165,you have seen many cut down in war in thick of battle  or slaughtered in a combat hand to hand  but you would grieve with even deeper pity if you could see us lying dead beneath the tables piled with food and wine 
3166,the floor
3167,swam thick with blood 
3168,i heard the desperate voice of priam s daughter  poor cassandra  whom deceitful clytemnestra killed beside me  as i lay dying  struck through by the sword  i tried to lift my arms up from the ground 
3169,that she dog turned away 
3170,i went to hades 
3171,she did not even shut my eyes or close my mouth 
3172,there is no more disgusting act than when a wife betrays a man like that 
3173,that woman formed a plot to murder me 
3174,her husband  when i got back home  i thought i would be welcomed  at least by my slaves and children 
3175,she has such an evil mind that she has poured down shame on her own head and on all other women  even good ones 
3176,i cried out  curse her  zeus has always brought disaster to the house of atreus through women 
3177,many men were lost for helen  and clytemnestra formed this plot against you when you were far away 
3178,at once he answered 
3179,so you must never treat your wife too well 
3180,do not let her know everything you know 
3181,tell her some things  hide others 
3182,but your wife will not kill you  odysseus 
3183,the wise penelope is much too sensible to do such things 
3184,your bride was very young when we went off to war 
3185,she had a baby still at her breast  who must be now a man  he will be glad when you come home and see him  and he will throw his arms around his father 
3186,that is how things should go 
3187,my wife prevented my eager eyes from gazing at my son 
3188,she killed me first 
3189,i have a final piece of sound advice for you take heed of it 
3190,when you arrive in your own land  do not anchor your ship in full view  move in secret 
3191,there is no trusting women any longer 
3192,but have you any news about my son 
3193,is he alive 
3194,is he in orchomenus  or sandy pylos  or with menelaus
3195,in sparta 
3196,surely my fine son orestes is not yet dead 
3197,i answered  agamemnon  why ask me this 
3198,i do not even know whether he is alive or dead 
3199,it is pointless to talk of hypotheticals 
3200,both of us wept profusely  deeply grieving over the bitter words we spoke 
3201,then came the spirits of achilles and patroclus and of antilochus and ajax  who was handsomest and had the best physique 
3202,of all the greeks  next only to achilles the sprinter 
3203,and achilles recognized me and spoke in tears 
3204,my lord odysseus  you fox  what will you think of next 
3205,how could you bear to come down to hades 
3206,numb dead people live here  the shades of poor exhausted mortals 
3207,i said  achilles  greatest of greek heroes  i came down here to meet tiresias  in case he had advice for my return to rocky ithaca 
3208,i have not even
3209,reached greece  let alone my homeland 
3210,i have had bad luck 
3211,but no one s luck was ever better than yours  nor ever will be 
3212,in your life we greeks respected you as we do gods  and now that you are here  you have great power among the dead 
3213,achilles  you should not be bitter at your death 
3214,but he replied  odysseus  you must not comfort me for death 
3215,i would prefer to be a workman  hired by a poor man on a peasant farm 
3216,than rule as king of all the dead 
3217,but come  tell me about my son 
3218,do you have news 
3219,did he march off to war to be a leader 
3220,and what about my father peleus 
3221,does he still have good standing among all the myrmidons 
3222,or do they treat him badly in phthia and greece  since he is old and frail 
3223,now i have left the light of day  and am not there to help  as on the plains of troy when i was killing the best trojans 
3224,to help the greeks 
3225,if i could go for even a little while  with all that strength i had  up to my father s house  i would make those who hurt and disrespect him wish my hands were not invincible 
3226,i answered him  i have no news to tell about your father  but i can tell you all about your son  dear neoptolemus 
3227,i brought him from scyros by ship  with other well armed greeks 
3228,when we were strategizing about troy 
3229,he always spoke up first and to the purpose  unmatched except by nestor and myself 
3230,and when we fought at troy  he never paused in the great throng of battle  he was always fearlessly running forward  and he slaughtered enormous numbers in the clash of war 
3231,i cannot name all those he killed for us 
3232,but with his bronze he cut down eurypylus  the son of telephus  most handsome man i ever saw  next only to great memnon 
3233,the multitude of cetians he brought were also killed  since priam bribed his mother 
3234,when we  the argive leaders  were preparing to climb inside the wooden horse  it was my task to open up and close the door 
3235,the other greek commanders were in tears  their legs were shaking 
3236,not your handsome boy  i never saw his face grow pale  he had no tears to wipe away 
3237,inside the horse  he begged me to allow him to jump out 
3238,he gripped his sword hilt and his heavy spear  so desperate to go hurt the trojans 
3239,at last  when we had sacked the lofty city of priam  he embarked weighed down with spoils 
3240,no sharp bronze spear had wounded him at all  he was unhurt by all the skirmishes endured in war when ares rages blind 
3241,after i told him this  achilles ghost took great swift footed strides across the fields of asphodel  delighted to have heard
3242,about the glorious prowess of his son 
3243,other dead souls were gathering  all sad  each told the story of his sorrow 
3244,only ajax kept back  enraged because i won achilles armor  when the case was judged beside the ships 
3245,the hero s mother  thetis  and sons of troy  and pallas  gave the arms to me  i wish i had not won this contest  for those arms ajax lies beneath the earth  whose looks and deeds were best of all the greeks
3246,after achilles  son of peleus 
3247,i spoke to him to try to make it up 
3248,please  ajax  son of mighty telamon  can you not set aside your rage at me about those cursed arms 
3249,not even now  in death 
3250,the gods made them to ruin us 
3251,you were our tower  what a loss you were  we greeks were struck by grief when you were gone  we mourned as long for you as for achilles 
3252,blame nobody but zeus 
3253,he ruined us 
3254,in hatred for the army of the greeks  and that was why he brought this doom on you 
3255,but listen now  my lord 
3256,subdue your anger 
3257,he did not answer 
3258,he went off and followed the spirits of the dead to erebus 
3259,despite his rage  we might have spoken longer if i had not felt in my heart an urge to see more spirits 
3260,i saw minos there  the son of zeus  who holds the golden scepter and sits in judgment on the dead 
3261,they ask
3262,their king to arbitrate disputes  inside the house of hades  where the doors are always wide open 
3263,i saw great orion  chasing across the fields of asphodel the beasts he killed when living high in lonely mountains  holding his indestructible bronze club 
3264,and i saw tityus  the son of gaia  stretched out nine miles 
3265,when leto  zeus lover  was traveling to pytho  through the fields of beautiful panopeus  he raped her 
3266,two vultures sit on either side of him  ripping his liver  plunging in his bowels  he fails to push them off 
3267,i saw the pain of tantalus  in water to his chin  so parched  no way to drink 
3268,when that old man bent down towards the water  it was gone  some god had dried it up  and at his feet dark earth appeared 
3269,tall leafy trees hung fruit above his head  sweet figs and pomegranates and brightly shining apples and ripe olives 
3270,but when he grasped them with his hands  the wind hurled them away towards the shadowy clouds 
3271,and i saw sisyphus in torment  pushing a giant rock with both hands  leaning on it with all his might to shove it up towards a hilltop  when he almost reached the peak  its weight would swerve  and it would roll back down  heedlessly 
3272,but he kept on straining  pushing  his body drenched in sweat  his head all dusty 
3273,i saw a phantom of great heracles 
3274,the man himself is with the deathless gods  happy and feasting  with fine ankled hebe  the child of mighty zeus and golden hera 
3275,around his ghost  the dead souls shrieked like birds  all panic struck 
3276,he walked like gloomy night  holding his bow uncased and with an arrow held on the string 
3277,he glowered terribly  poised for a shot 
3278,around his chest was strapped a terrifying baldric made of gold  fashioned with marvelous images of bears 
3279,wild boars  and lions with fierce staring eyes  and battles and the slaughtering of men 
3280,i hope the craftsman who designed this scene will never make another work like this 
3281,this heracles at once knew who i was  and full of grief he cried  odysseus  master of every circumstance  so you are also tortured by the weight of fortune as i was while i lived beneath the sun 
3282,i was a son of zeus  and yet my pain
3283,was infinite 
3284,i was enslaved to someone far less heroic than myself  who laid harsh labors on me  once he sent me here to bring back cerberus  since he could think of no worse task for me  i brought the dog up out of hades  with the help of hermes  and flashing eyed athena 
3285,he went back to hades house 
3286,i stayed  in case more heroes who died in ancient times should come to me  i would have seen the noble men i hoped for 
3287,pirithous and theseus  god born 
3288,but masses of the dead came thronging round with eerie cries  and cold fear seized me  lest the dreadful queen persephone might send the monster s head  the gorgon  out of hades 
3289,so then i hurried back and told my men to climb on board the ship and loose the cables 
3290,they did so  and sat down along the benches 
3291,the current bore the ship down river ocean  first with the help of oars  and then fair wind 
3292,difficult choices our ship sailed out beyond the stream of ocean  across the waves of open sea  and came to aeaea  home of newborn dawn  who dances in meadows with the beams of helius 
3293,we beached the ship upon the sandy shore  and disembarked  and there we fell asleep while waiting for bright morning 
3294,when dawn came  born early  with her fingertips like petals  i sent my men to circe s house  to bring the body of the dead elpenor 
3295,quickly
3296,we chopped the wood and at the farthest headland we held a funeral for him  and wept profusely  crying out in grief 
3297,we burned his body and his gear  and built a mound  and dragged a pillar onto it  and fixed his oar on top each ritual step in turn 
3298,circe  the well groomed goddess  was aware that we were back from hades  and she hurried to meet us with her slaves 
3299,they carried bread and meat and bright red wine 
3300,she stood among us 
3301,and said  this is amazing  you all went alive to hades you will be twice dead  when other people only die one time  eat now  and stay here drinking wine all day 
3302,at dawn  sail on 
3303,i will explain your route in detail  so no evil thing can stitch a means to hurt you  on the land or sea 
3304,i am a stubborn man  but i agreed  so there we sat and feasted on the meat and strong sweet wine until the sun went down 
3305,when darkness fell  the men slept by the ship 
3306,then circe took my hand  and led me off apart from them  and questioned me in detail 
3307,i told her everything 
3308,the lady circe replied at last  that quest is over now 
3309,so listen  i will give you good instructions  another god will make sure you remember 
3310,first you will reach the sirens  who bewitch all passersby 
3311,if anyone goes near them in ignorance  and listens to their voices 
3312,that man will never travel to his home  and never make his wife and children happy to have him back with them again 
3313,the sirens who sit there in their meadow will seduce him with piercing songs 
3314,around about them lie great heaps of men  flesh rotting from their bones  their skin all shriveled up 
3315,use wax to plug your sailors ears as you row past  so they are deaf to them 
3316,but if you wish to hear them  your men must fasten you to your ship s mast
3317,by hand and foot  straight upright  with tight ropes 
3318,so bound  you can enjoy the sirens song 
3319,but if you beg your men to set you free  they have to tie you down with firmer knots 
3320,i will not give you definite instructions about which route to take when you have sailed beyond the sirens 
3321,let your heart decide 
3322,there are two choices  and the first goes through vast overhanging rocks  which amphitrite batters aggressively with mighty waves 
3323,the blessed gods call these the wandering rocks 
3324,no birds can fly through safe  not even doves  who bring ambrosia to zeus 
3325,one dove is always lost in that sheer gulf of stone and zeus must send another to restore the number of the flock 
3326,no human ship has ever passed there 
3327,when one tries to enter  the waves and raging gusts of fire engulf ship timbers and the bodies of the men 
3328,only the famous argo sailed through there
3329,returning from the visit with aeetes 
3330,the current hurled the ship towards the rocks  but hera  who loved jason  led them safe 
3331,taking the second way  you meet two rocks  one reaches up to heaven with its peak  surrounded by blue fog that never clears 
3332,no light comes through there  even in the summer 
3333,no man could climb it or set foot upon it  even if he had twenty hands and feet 
3334,the rock is sheer  as if it had been polished 
3335,right in the middle lies a murky cave that faces west  towards dark erebus 
3336,steer your ship past it  great odysseus 
3337,the hollow cave is so high up  no man could shoot it with an arrow 
3338,there lives scylla  howling and barking horribly  her voice is puppylike  but she is dangerous  even a god would be afraid of her 
3339,she has twelve dangling legs and six long necks with a gruesome head on each  and in each face
3340,three rows of crowded teeth  pregnant with death 
3341,her belly slumps inside the hollow cave  she keeps her heads above the yawning chasm and scopes around the rock  and hunts for fish 
3342,she catches dolphins  seals  and sometimes even enormous whales queen amphitrite  ruler of roaring waters  nurtures many creatures 
3343,no sailors ever pass that way unharmed 
3344,she snatches one man with each mouth from off each dark prowed ship 
3345,the other rock is near 
3346,enough to shoot an arrow right across 
3347,this second rock is lower down  and on it there grows a fig tree with thick leaves 
3348,beneath  divine charybdis sucks black water down 
3349,three times a day she spurts it up  three times she glugs it down 
3350,avoid that place when she is swallowing the water 
3351,no one could save you from death then  even great poseidon 
3352,row fast  and steer your ship alongside scylla  since it is better if you lose six men
3353,than all of them 
3354,i answered  goddess  please  tell me the truth  is there no other way 
3355,or can i somehow circumvent charybdis and stop that scylla when she tries to kill my men 
3356,the goddess answered  no  you fool  your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war 
3357,but now you must surrender to the gods 
3358,she is not mortal 
3359,she is deathless evil  terrible  wild and cruel 
3360,you cannot fight her 
3361,the best solution and the only way
3362,is flight 
3363,i am afraid if you take time to arm beside the rock  she will attack again with all six heads and take six more 
3364,so row away with all your might  and call on scylla s mother  cratais  great force  who bore her as a blight on humankind 
3365,go fast  before the goddess strikes again 
3366,then you will reach the island called thrinacia  where helius keeps sheep and many cattle  fifty per herd  with seven herds in all 
3367,they never reproduce or die  and those who tend them are the smooth haired goddesses  phaethousa and lampetia  the shining daughters of helius by bright neaira 
3368,she brought them up  then sent them off to live there in remote thrinacia  to guard their father s sheep and cattle 
3369,if you can remember home and leave the cows unharmed  you will at last arrive in ithaca 
3370,but if you damage them  i must foretell
3371,disaster for your ship and for your crew 
3372,even if you survive  you will return late and humiliated  having caused the death of all your men 
3373,the golden throne of dawn was riding up the sky as circe concluded  and she strode across her island 
3374,i went back to my ship and roused the men to get on board and loose the sternward cables 
3375,embarking  they sat down  each in his place  and struck the gray saltwater with their oars 
3376,behind our dark prowed ship  the dreadful goddess circe sent friendly wind to fill the sails 
3377,we worked efficiently to organize the rigging  and the breeze and pilot steered 
3378,then with an anxious heart i told the crew  my friends  the revelations circe shared with me should not be kept a secret  known to me alone 
3379,i will share them with you  and we can die in knowledge of the truth  or else escape 
3380,she said we must avoid
3381,the voices of the otherworldly sirens  steer past their flowering meadow 
3382,and she says that i alone should hear their singing 
3383,bind me  to keep me upright at the mast  wound round with rope 
3384,if i beseech you and command you to set me free  you must increase my bonds and chain me even tighter 
3385,so i told them each detail 
3386,soon our well built ship  blown fast by fair winds  neared the island of the sirens  and suddenly  the wind died down 
3387,calm came 
3388,some spirit lulled the waves to sleep 
3389,the men got up  pulled down the sails  and stowed them in the hollow hold 
3390,they sat at oar and made the water whiten  struck by polished wood 
3391,i gripped a wheel of wax between my hands and cut it small 
3392,firm kneading and the sunlight warmed it  and then i rubbed it in the ears of each man in his turn 
3393,they bound my hands and feet  straight upright at the mast 
3394,they sat and hit the sea with oars 
3395,we traveled fast 
3396,and when we were in earshot of the sirens  they knew our ship was near  and started singing 
3397,odysseus  come here  you are well known from many stories  glory of the greeks  now stop your ship and listen to our voices 
3398,all those who pass this way hear honeyed song  poured from our mouths 
3399,the music brings them joy  and they go on their way with greater knowledge  since we know everything the greeks and trojans suffered in troy  by gods will  and we know
3400,whatever happens anywhere on earth 
3401,their song was so melodious  i longed to listen more 
3402,i told my men to free me  i scowled at them  but they kept rowing on 
3403,eurylochus and perimedes stood and tied me even tighter  with more knots 
3404,but when we were well past them and i could no longer hear the singing of the sirens  i nodded to my men  and they removed the wax that i had used to plug their ears 
3405,and untied me  when we had left that island  i saw a mighty wave and smoke  and heard a roar 
3406,the men were terrified  their hands let fall the oars they splashed down in the water 
3407,the ship stayed still  since no one now was pulling the slender blades 
3408,i strode along the deck pausing to cheer each man  then gave a speech to rally all of them 
3409,dear friends  we are experienced in danger 
3410,this is not worse than the time the cyclops captured us 
3411,and forced us to remain inside his cave 
3412,we got away that time  thanks to my skill and brains and strategy 
3413,remember that 
3414,come on then  all of you  and trust my words 
3415,sit on your benches  strike the swelling deep with oars  since zeus may grant us a way out from this disaster also 
3416,pilot  listen  these are your orders 
3417,as you hold the rudder  direct the ship away from that dark smoke and rising wave  and head towards the rock 
3418,if the ship veers the other way  you will endanger us 
3419,they promptly followed orders 
3420,i did not mention scylla  since she meant inevitable death  and if they knew  the men would drop the oars and go and huddle down in the hold in fear 
3421,then i ignored circe s advice that i should not bear arms  it was too hard for me  i dressed myself in glorious armor  in my hands i took two long spears  and i climbed up on the forecastle 
3422,i thought that rocky scylla would appear from that direction  to destroy my men 
3423,so we rowed through the narrow strait in tears 
3424,on one side  scylla  on the other  shining charybdis with a dreadful gurgling noise sucked down the water 
3425,when she spewed it out  she seethed  all churning like a boiling cauldron on a huge fire 
3426,the froth flew high  to spatter the topmost rocks on either side 
3427,but when she swallowed back the sea  she seemed all stirred
3428,from inside  and the rock around was roaring dreadfully  and the dark blue sand below was visible 
3429,the men were seized by fear 
3430,but while our frightened gaze was on charybdis  scylla snatched six men from the ship my strongest  best fighters 
3431,looking back from down below  i saw their feet and hands up high  as they were carried off 
3432,in agony they cried to me and called my name their final words 
3433,as when a fisherman out on a cliff
3434,casts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn to trick the little fishes with his bait  when one is caught  he flings it gasping back onto the shore so those men gasped as scylla lifted them up high to her rocky cave and at the entrance ate them up still screaming  still reaching out to me in their death throes 
3435,that was the most heartrending sight i saw in all the time i suffered on the sea 
3436,free from the rocks of scylla and charybdis
3437,we quickly reached the island of the god  hyperion s son helius  the sun god 
3438,there were his cattle  with their fine broad faces  and many flocks of well fed sheep 
3439,while still out on the sea in my black ship  i heard the lowing of the cattle in their pens  and bleating of the sheep 
3440,i kept in mind the words of blind tiresias the prophet and circe 
3441,both had given strict instructions that we avoid the island of the sun 
3442,the god of human joy 
3443,i told the men with heavy heart  my friends  i know how much you have endured 
3444,but listen to me now 
3445,tiresias and circe both insisted we must avoid the island of the sun  the joy of mortals 
3446,they said dreadful danger lurks there for us 
3447,we have to steer our ship around it 
3448,they were quite downcast by this 
3449,eurylochus said angrily to me  you are unfair to us  odysseus 
3450,you may be strong  you never seem to tire  you must be made of iron 
3451,but we men have had no rest or sleep  we are exhausted 
3452,and you refuse to let us disembark and cook our tasty dinner on this island 
3453,you order us to drift around all night in our swift ship across the misty sea 
3454,at night  fierce storms rise up and wreck men s ships  and how can anyone escape disaster if sudden gusts of wind from north or west
3455,bring cruel blasts to break the ship  despite the wishes of the gods 
3456,let us submit to evening 
3457,let us stay here  and cook food beside the ship 
3458,at dawn we can embark and sail the open sea 
3459,that was his speech 
3460,the other men agreed  and then i saw a spirit must be plotting our destruction 
3461,my words flew out 
3462,eurylochus  you force me to yield  since i am one and you are many 
3463,but all of you  swear me a mighty oath 
3464,if we find any herd of cows  or flock of sheep  do not be fool enough to kill a single animal 
3465,stay clear  and eat the food provided by immortal circe 
3466,they swore as i commanded 
3467,when they finished making the oath  we set our well built ship inside the curving harbor  near freshwater 
3468,the men got out and skillfully cooked dinner 
3469,when they were satisfied with food and drink  they wept  remembering their dear companions 
3470,whom scylla captured from the ship and ate 
3471,sweet sleep came down upon them as they cried 
3472,when night was over  when the stars were gone  zeus roused a blast of wind  an eerie storm 
3473,he covered earth and sea with fog  and darkness fell down from heaven 
3474,when rose fingered dawn appeared  we dragged the ship inside a cave  a place nymphs danced in  and we moored it there 
3475,i gave a speech to my assembled men 
3476,my friends  we have supplies on board 
3477,let us
3478,not touch the cattle  or we will regret it 
3479,those cows and fat sheep are the property of helius  the great sun god  who sees all things  and hears all things 
3480,i told them this 
3481,reluctantly they yielded 
3482,but that month the south wind blew and never stopped 
3483,no other was ever blowing  only south and east 
3484,while the men still had food and wine  they kept clear of the cows 
3485,they hoped to save their lives 
3486,but when our ship s supplies ran out  the men
3487,were forced to hunt  they used their hooks to catch both fish and birds  whatever they could get  since hunger gnawed their bellies 
3488,i strode off to pray  in case some god would show me how to get back home 
3489,i left my men behind  and crossed the island  washed my hands  in shelter out of the wind  and prayed to all the gods 
3490,they poured sweet sleep upon my eyes 
3491,meanwhile  eurylochus proposed a foolish plan 
3492,listen  my friends  you have already suffered
3493,too much 
3494,all human deaths are hard to bear 
3495,but starving is most miserable of all 
3496,so let us poach the finest of these cattle  and sacrifice them to the deathless gods 
3497,if we get home to ithaca  at once we will construct a temple to the sun god  with treasure in it 
3498,if he is so angry about these cows that he decides to wreck our ship  and if the other gods agree i would prefer to drink the sea and die
3499,at once  than perish slowly  shriveled up here on this desert island 
3500,all the others agreed with him 
3501,they went to poach the best of helius cattle  which were grazing beside the ship 
3502,the men surrounded them  and called upon the gods 
3503,they had plucked leaves from oak trees on the ship there was no barley 
3504,they prayed  then killed them  skinned them  and cut off the thighs  and covered up the bones with fat  a double layer  with raw meat on top 
3505,they had no wine to pour libations over the burning offering  but they made do with water  and they roasted all the innards 
3506,and when the thighs were burned  the entrails sprinkled  they cut the other meat up into chunks for skewers 
3507,sweet sleep melted from my eyes  i rushed back to the ship beside the shore 
3508,when i was close  the meaty smell of cooking enfolded me  i groaned  and told the gods  o zeus  and all you deathless gods  you blinded
3509,my mind with that infernal sleep 
3510,my men did dreadful things while i was gone 
3511,meanwhile  lampetia in flowing skirts ran off to tell the sun god we had killed his cows 
3512,enraged  he called the other gods 
3513,great zeus  and all you other deathless gods  you must punish odysseus men 
3514,they killed my cattle  i delighted in those cows all through each day  when i went up to heaven and when i turned to earth 
3515,if they do not
3516,repay me  i will sink down into hades and bring my bright light only to the dead 
3517,zeus answered  helius  please shine with us and shine for mortals on life giving earth 
3518,i will immediately smite their ship with my bright thunderbolt  and smash it up in fragments  all across the wine dark sea 
3519,i heard this from the beautiful calypso  who had been told by hermes 
3520,back on shore beside my ship  i scolded each of them 
3521,it did no good  the cows were dead already 
3522,the gods sent signs the hides began to twitch  the meat on skewers started mooing  raw and cooked 
3523,there was the sound of cattle lowing 
3524,for six days my men banqueted on beef from helius 
3525,when zeus  the son of cronus  led in the seventh day  the wind became less stormy  and we quickly went on board 
3526,we set the mast up and unfurled the sails and set out on the open sea 
3527,when we
3528,had left that island  we could see no other  only the sky and sea 
3529,zeus made a mass of dark blue storm cloud hang above our ship 
3530,the sea grew dark beneath it 
3531,for a moment the ship moved on  but then came zephyr  shrieking  noisily rushing  with torrential tempest 
3532,a mighty gust of wind broke off both forestays  the tacking was all scattered in the hold 
3533,the mast was broken backwards  and it struck the pilot in the stern  it smashed his skull 
3534,his bones were crushed  his skeleton was smashed 
3535,he fell down like a diver from the deck  his spirit left his body 
3536,at that instant  zeus thundered and hurled bolts to strike the ship  shaken  it filled with sulfur 
3537,all the men fell overboard  and they were swept away like seagulls on the waves beside the ship 
3538,the gods prevented them from reaching home 
3539,i paced on board until the current ripped the ship s side from the keel 
3540,the waves bore off
3541,the husk  and snapped the mast 
3542,but thrown across it there was a backstay cable  oxhide leather 
3543,with this i lashed the keel and mast together  and rode them  carried on by fearsome winds 
3544,at last the tempest ceased  the west wind lulled 
3545,i worried that the south wind might compel me to backtrack  to the terrible charybdis 
3546,all night i was swept backwards and at sunrise i came back to the dreadful rocks of scylla and of charybdis  gulping salty water 
3547,and overshadowed by the fig tree s branches 
3548,i jumped and clutched its trunk  batlike unable to plant my feet  or climb 
3549,the roots were down too low  the tall long branches were too high 
3550,so i kept clinging on  i hoped charybdis would belch my mast and keel back up 
3551,she did  as one who spends the whole day judging quarrels between young men  at last goes home to eat at that same hour  the planks came bobbing up out of charybdis 
3552,i let go my hands
3553,and feet and dropped myself way down to splash into the sea below  beside the timbers of floating wood 
3554,i clambered onto them  and used my hands to row myself away  and zeus ensured that scylla did not see me  or else i could not have survived 
3555,i drifted for nine days 
3556,on the evening of the tenth  the gods helped me to reach the island of the dreadful  beautiful  divine calypso 
3557,she loved and cared for me  why should i tell
3558,the story that i told you and your wife yesterday in your house 
3559,it is annoying  repeating tales that have been told before 
3560,two tricksters after he finished  all were silent  spellbound  sitting inside the shadowy hall 
3561,at last  alcinous said  now  odysseus  since you have been my guest  beneath my roof  you need not wander anymore 
3562,you have endured enough  you will get home again 
3563,and all you regulars  my honored friends who always drink red wine here in my house and listen to my singer  heed my words 
3564,our guest has clothes packed up inside a trunk 
3565,and other gifts that we have given him 
3566,each of us now should add a mighty tripod and cauldron 
3567,i will make the people pay a levy  so that none of us will suffer from unrewarded generosity 
3568,the king s words pleased them all 
3569,they went back home to rest 
3570,then dawn was born again  her fingers bloomed  and they hurried back towards the ship bringing heroic gifts of bronze 
3571,the king embarked and stowed them underneath the beams 
3572,to leave room for the crew when they were rowing 
3573,then all the men went back with him to eat 
3574,the holy king killed sacrificial meat a cow to zeus of dark clouds  son of cronus  who rules the world 
3575,they burned the thighs and feasted in happiness 
3576,the well respected singer demodocus made music in their midst 
3577,but all the while odysseus kept turning his head towards the shining sun  impatient for it to set 
3578,he longed to leave 
3579,as when
3580,a man is desperate for dinnertime after he spends the whole day with his oxen dragging the jointed plow across the field  and welcomes sunset  when he can go home to eat  his legs are aching on the way just so odysseus was glad of sunset 
3581,at once he told the seafaring phaeacians  especially alcinous  great king  and all of you  please send me safely home with offerings  and thank you 
3582,i am grateful
3583,to you for giving me my heart s desire  a passage home  with gifts 
3584,i hope the gods maintain my luck 
3585,when i am home  i pray to find my wife still faultless  and my loved ones safe 
3586,and may you phaeacians live to bring joy to your wives and children every blessing 
3587,i pray there is no trouble for your people 
3588,they praised his words and said that they must help their guest go home  since he had spoken well 
3589,alcinous addressed his right hand man 
3590,pontonous  now mix a bowl of wine  serve drinks to everybody in the hall  so we may pray to zeus and help our guest back to his homeland 
3591,so the steward mixed a cheering bowl of wine and served them all in turn 
3592,still in their seats  they poured libations to all the blessed gods that live in heaven 
3593,godlike odysseus stood up and put a double handled cup into the hands of arete 
3594,his words flew out to her 
3595,bless you forever  queen  until old age and death arrive for you  as for us all 
3596,i will leave now 
3597,be happy in your home and children  and your people  and your king 
3598,with that  the noble hero crossed the threshold 
3599,alcinous sent out his steward with him to guide him to the swift ship on the shore 
3600,arete sent some slave girls too 
3601,one brought a freshly laundered cloak and tunic  one carried the well carved chest  the third brought bread
3602,and red wine 
3603,when they reached the ship  the guides took all the food and drink and packed it neatly inside the hold 
3604,they spread a sheet and blanket out on the stern deck of the hollow ship so he could sleep there soundly 
3605,climbing on  he lay there quietly 
3606,the rowers sat down on the benches calmly  and then loosed the cable from the mooring stone 
3607,they pulled  leaning back hard  the oar blades splashed the water 
3608,a sound sweet sleep fell on his eyes  like death 
3609,he did not stir 
3610,as four fine stallions rush at the whip and race their chariot across the track  heads high  an easy canter so was the ship s prow raised 
3611,the seething waves of sounding purple sea rushed round the stern as she sped straight ahead 
3612,the swiftest bird  a hawk  could never overtake  she sailed so fast  and cleaved the waves 
3613,she bore a man whose mind was like the gods   who had endured many heartbreaking losses  and the pain
3614,of war and shipwreck 
3615,now he slept in peace  and he remembered nothing of his pain 
3616,but when the brightest star that carries news about the coming dawn rose up the sky  the seaborne ship neared land 
3617,there is a harbor of phorcys  ancient sea god  in the district of ithaca 
3618,on either side of it there are sheer cliffs that jut across the bay  they shelter it and keep big waves outside when storm winds blow 
3619,the ships remain in harbor
3620,without a tether  once they cross its bounds 
3621,at the bay s head there grows a long leafed olive  and near it is a beautiful dark cave  a holy place of sea nymphs nereids 
3622,inside are bowls and amphorae of stone  and buzzing bees bring honey 
3623,there are looms  also of stone  the nymphs weave purple cloth  sea purple it is marvelous to see 
3624,water is always flowing through 
3625,there are two entrances 
3626,the north one is for humans 
3627,the south is sacred 
3628,people cannot enter that way it is the path of the immortals 
3629,they rowed inside the bay  they knew the place of old 
3630,their arms were pulling at top speed  the ship was traveling so fast that when she reached dry land  she beached for half her length 
3631,they disembarked  and lifted from the ship odysseus  wrapped up in sheets and blankets 
3632,they set him on the sand  still fast asleep 
3633,they unpacked all the presents he was given
3634,by the phaeacian lords to take back home  thanks to athena s care 
3635,they heaped the things beside the olive tree  so no one passing would do them any damage while their owner was sleeping 
3636,then they rowed away  back home 
3637,poseidon  lord of earthquakes  still remembered his hatred of odysseus  he asked zeus what he meant to do 
3638,o father zeus  i will lose all my standing with the gods  since mortals fail to honor me  though these
3639,phaeacians are my very own descendants  i always said odysseus would reach home in the end 
3640,i did not take away that privilege from him  no  not at all  since you had promised it with your own nod 
3641,their swift ship carried him across the ocean  and they have set him down in ithaca with a magnificent array of gifts  bronze  heaps of gold and fine spun clothes  far more spoils than he ever would have won at troy
3642,if he had got out safely 
3643,storm god zeus exclaimed  earth shaker  how absurd  the gods do not dishonor you  it would be hard to disrespect an elder so high ranking 
3644,if willful humans fail to show respect  then punish them  you always have that power 
3645,do as you wish  poseidon answered  lord of dark clouds  i have always wanted to 
3646,i held back out of deference to you 
3647,but now  when that fine ship of those phaeacians
3648,comes back from helping him across  i want to smash it in the sea  and overwhelm their city with a mountain  to prevent them from ever guiding travelers again 
3649,the cloud lord zeus said  brother  i suggest that while the people in the city watch  you turn the ship arriving into stone  still looking like a ship 
3650,they will all be shocked 
3651,then you can surround their town with a huge mountain 
3652,hearing this  poseidon
3653,went to phaeacian scheria  and waited 
3654,as the ship sped towards the shore  the god moved near it  turned it all to stone  and slapped his palm to make it rooted to the seabed 
3655,he vanished  and the people of phaeacia  known for their oars and famous ships  began to ask each other  what 
3656,who fixed that ship firm in the sea as she was rushing home 
3657,we saw it all  they could not understand it 
3658,alcinous addressed the crowd and spoke 
3659,so it is true  my father long ago said that poseidon hates us for our habit of helping travelers get home again  we got away with it  but he foretold that one day great poseidon would destroy a ship on her return from such a journey  the god would hide our city with a mountain 
3660,and now the old man s words are coming true 
3661,so all of you must listen to me now 
3662,stop helping visitors to travel onward 
3663,we have to sacrifice twelve bulls  handpicked for lord poseidon  so he may show mercy  and not enfold our city in a mountain 
3664,at this  they were afraid  and they prepared the bulls  and all the leaders of phaeacia prayed to poseidon  standing round the altar 
3665,meanwhile odysseus  who had been sleeping in his own native land of ithaca woke up  but did not recognize the place from which he had been absent for so long 
3666,pallas athena cast a mist upon it  so she could tell him how things stood  and make him unrecognizable to his own wife and family and neighbors  till he paid the suitors back for how they misbehaved 
3667,the friendly harbors and the winding paths and leafy trees were all quite unfamiliar to their own king 
3668,he leapt up to his feet and looking at his native land  he groaned and smacked his thighs  and sobbed  where am i now 
3669,are those who live here violent and cruel 
3670,or are they kind to strangers  folks who fear the gods 
3671,where can i carry all my treasure 
3672,and where can i go wandering 
3673,if only i had remained there in phaeacia  till i went on to some other mighty king who might have been my friend and helped me home 
3674,where can i leave my things 
3675,not here for sure  they will be stolen 
3676,those phaeacian lords were not so trustworthy  they promised me
3677,that they would bring me home to ithaca 
3678,they broke their word and brought me somewhere else 
3679,may zeus who helps the needy make them pay  zeus watches everyone  and punishes the sinner 
3680,let me count my treasure now they may have stolen some when they sailed off 
3681,he counted all the tripods  cauldrons  gold and cloth  but none was missing 
3682,then he paced beside the loud resounding sea  hunched up with homesickness and sobbing in his grief 
3683,athena came towards him  she looked like a shepherd  young and soft skinned as a prince  wearing a folded mantle of fine cloth across her shoulders  on her tender feet were sandals  and she held a javelin 
3684,odysseus was overjoyed to see her 
3685,he cried  oh  friend  you are the very first person that i have met here 
3686,greetings  please  be kind  protect my treasure and myself 
3687,i pray to you and supplicate  as if
3688,you were a god 
3689,i touch your knees  please help me  and tell me  please  what is this place 
3690,an island 
3691,or is it a peninsula that slopes towards the sea from fertile mainland fields 
3692,who lives here 
3693,and with twinkling eyes the goddess said  stranger  you must be a foreigner from distant parts  or foolish  since you ask about this famous country 
3694,many people know it  from those who live towards the east under the rising sun  to those out west
3695,in lands of gloomy dusk 
3696,this is rough country  not fit for grazing horses  and not spacious  but not infertile  corn and wine abound here 
3697,the land is always wet with rain and dew 
3698,there are fine water holes  and it is good for raising goats and cattle  and the trees are varied 
3699,foreigner  i think the name of ithaca is even known in troy  a land they say is far away from greece 
3700,odysseus  who had endured so much 
3701,so long  was overjoyed  to hear from her that he was in his own dear native land 
3702,his words took wings and flew  but he did not tell her the truth  he bit his story back 
3703,his mind was always full of clever schemes 
3704,yes  i have heard of ithaca  although i come from distant crete 
3705,now i am here with all this wealth  i left an equal share of riches for my children back at home 
3706,i am in exile 
3707,on the fields of crete
3708,i killed orsilochus  the speedy sprinter  the son of idomeneus  the king 
3709,i had refused to serve or help his father at troy  i led my own men 
3710,so the son wanted to steal the trojan spoils for which i worked so hard  in war and long sea journeys 
3711,i hid beside the road with one companion  and as he came back from the countryside  i ambushed him  and hit him with my spear 
3712,the sky was dark that night  and no one saw me
3713,kill him with my sharp sword of bronze 
3714,and after i murdered him  i quickly rowed away to visit the phoenicians  and i gave them a share of loot  which made them very glad 
3715,i told them they should transport me to pylos  or famous elis  ruled by the epeians 
3716,but storm winds drove them off away from there against their will  they did not mean to trick me  so swept off course  we came here in the night 
3717,we rowed at top speed into harbor  hungry 
3718,but none of us took any thought of dinner 
3719,we disembarked and all lay down right there 
3720,sweet sleep enfolded me  i was exhausted 
3721,they took my treasure from the ship and set it beside me as i slept upon the sand 
3722,and then they sailed away to well built sidon  and i was left here grieving 
3723,at his words  athena smiled into his eyes 
3724,she took his hand  and changed her body to a woman s  beautiful  tall  and skilled in all the arts 
3725,her words were light as feathers 
3726,to outwit you in all your tricks  a person or a god would need to be an expert at deceit 
3727,you clever rascal  so duplicitous  so talented at lying  you love fiction and tricks so deeply  you refuse to stop even in your own land 
3728,yes  both of us are smart 
3729,no man can plan and talk like you  and i am known among the gods for insight and craftiness 
3730,you failed to recognize me 
3731,i am athena  child of zeus 
3732,i always stand near you and take care of you  in all your hardships 
3733,i made sure that you were welcomed by the phaeacians 
3734,i have come here now to weave a plan with you and hide the treasure which  thanks to me  they gave you to take home 
3735,i will reveal the challenges you face at home 
3736,this is your fate  and you must bear it bravely  not telling any man or woman that you have finished wandering and come back 
3737,suffer in silence  bear their brutal treatment 
3738,odysseus  still wary  answered  goddess  even the smartest man may find it hard to recognize you 
3739,you disguise yourself so many ways 
3740,i do know that you helped me during the trojan war  so long ago 
3741,but when we greeks had sacked the town of priam  and we embarked  and gods dispersed our fleet  i did not see you there on board my ship  daughter of zeus 
3742,you gave me no protection 
3743,lost and confused  i waited for the gods to free me from my pain 
3744,i met you later  in rich phaeacia  and you spoke to me comforting words  and led me to the city 
3745,please  by your father zeus  i cannot think that this is ithaca 
3746,i must be elsewhere 
3747,you want to fool me and make fun of me  tell me the truth  is this my own dear home 
3748,with glowing eyes she said  you always have such keen intelligence  and that is why
3749,i cannot leave you when you need my help 
3750,you have such intuition and such focus 
3751,an ordinary man would rush straight home to see his wife and children when he reached his country  after such a journey 
3752,you decided not to even ask about them  until you test your wife 
3753,she sits at home  passing each night in misery  each day in tears 
3754,for my part  i have never doubted 
3755,i felt sure in my heart you would get home 
3756,after the loss of all your men 
3757,but i did not want conflict with my father s brother  poseidon  who resented you because you blinded his beloved son 
3758,now i will show you ithaca  so you believe 
3759,this is the bay of phorcys  ancient sea god  and at the head there is an olive tree with long leaves  and nearby  the shady cave sacred to nymphs called nereids  to whom you sacrificed so many hundred cattle 
3760,and here is neriton  the wooded mountain 
3761,with that  the goddess made the mist disperse 
3762,the land was visible 
3763,odysseus  after so long a wait and so much pain  was filled with happiness at last 
3764,in joy he kissed the fertile earth of his own country  then lifted high his arms and prayed  o nymphs  i never thought i would come back to you  daughters of zeus 
3765,accept my loving prayers  and i will give you gifts  as in the past 
3766,if my commander  child of zeus  is kind and let us me live and raise my son 
3767,athena looked straight into his eyes and said  be brave 
3768,you need not worry 
3769,let us hurry now to hide the treasure safely in the cave 
3770,and then we must make plans 
3771,the goddess went down in the murky cave  and looked around for hiding spots 
3772,odysseus brought in the presents the phaeacians gave him gold  and tireless bronze and finely woven cloth 
3773,athena set them all inside  and fixed the door stone up  and then the two sat down against the sacred olive and they planned how to destroy the suitors 
3774,eyes aglow  athena said  great king  laertes son  master of plots and plans  odysseus  think how to strike the suitors 
3775,for three years they have been lording in your house and courting your godlike wife with gifts 
3776,she always longs for your return  and grieves 
3777,she leads them on
3778,with promises and messages to each  but her mind moves elsewhere 
3779,odysseus cried  oh  i would have died like agamemnon in my own house  if you had not explained exactly how things stand 
3780,so  goddess  now weave me a strategy to pay them back 
3781,stand by me  give me courage and the drive to fight as when i broke the shining crown of troy 
3782,if you will join me with that zeal and help me  goddess queen  i could do battle
3783,against three hundred men at once 
3784,athena looked straight at him  clear eyed 
3785,she said  i will be with you  truly 
3786,know i stand beside you as we begin our work 
3787,i do believe the suitors who devour your livelihood will spatter your broad floors with blood and brains 
3788,but now i will disguise you  so no human can recognize you 
3789,i will shrivel up the fine skin of your supple arms and legs  ruin your hair  and dress you up in rags 
3790,so everyone will shudder  seeing you 
3791,and i will cloud your eyes  to make you seem ugly to all the suitors  and your wife and to the son you left at home 
3792,now visit the swineherd who  though he is just a slave  adores your son and wise penelope and is your friend 
3793,go look for him among the sows who root beside the corax rock and near the spring of arethusa  drinking black water  eating good nutritious acorns 
3794,which fatten pigs 
3795,stay there and sit with him  and ask him everything 
3796,and i will go to sparta  where the girls are beautiful  to fetch telemachus  the boy you love 
3797,he went to menelaus  to find out if you are still alive 
3798,he asked her sharply  but why did you not tell him 
3799,you must know everything 
3800,did you want him suffering like me  lost out at sea  while others eat his whole inheritance 
3801,with shining eyes
3802,athena answered  come now  do not worry about the boy 
3803,i guided him myself so that he might win glory by his journey 
3804,he is not suffering 
3805,he is away  sitting and banqueting with menelaus 
3806,the suitors do indeed desire to kill him  and wait in ambush for him in their ship 
3807,but they will not succeed  i think 
3808,the earth will cover one or more of those who eat your property 
3809,then with her wand athena
3810,tapped him  his handsome body withered up  his limbs became arthritic 
3811,she bleached out his hair  and made his skin look old and wrinkled  and dimmed his fine bright eyes 
3812,she turned his clothes into a tattered cloak and ragged tunic  dirty with soot 
3813,she wrapped around his shoulders a massive leather deerskin  and she gave him a threadbare tote bag and a walking stick 
3814,their plans were set  they parted 
3815,she went off to sparta  to go fetch telemachus 
3816,a loyal slave leaving the bay  he hiked the rugged path through woodland and across the cliffs  athena had shown him where to go to find the swineherd 
3817,of all those in odysseus household  this noble slave cared most about preserving the master s property 
3818,odysseus found him as he was sitting out on his porch 
3819,his yard was high and visible for miles  of fieldstones topped with twigs of thorny pear 
3820,he built it in the absence of his master 
3821,with no help from laertes or the mistress 
3822,around the yard  he set a ring of stakes  of wood with bark stripped off 
3823,inside the yard  he made twelve sties all next to one another  for breeding sows  with fifty in each one 
3824,the boars slept outside  there were fewer of them  because the suitors kept on eating them 
3825,the swineherd let them have the fattest boars  just three hundred and sixty still remained 
3826,their captain kept four fierce half wild dogs
3827,to guard the gate 
3828,now he was cutting oxhide to make himself some sandals 
3829,of his men  three herded up the pigs  and ran around in all directions  he had sent the fourth to town to take a pig to those proud suitors 
3830,he had no choice  he had to satisfy their cravings for fresh meat 
3831,then suddenly the guard dogs saw odysseus  and rushed towards him with loud barks 
3832,he kept his head  and sank down to the ground and dropped his stick 
3833,they would have hurt him terribly  and shamed him on his own property but acting fast the swineherd dropped his leatherwork and rushed to chase the dogs away 
3834,he yelled at them and pelted them with stones to make them scatter 
3835,and then he told his master  my dogs almost ripped you apart  old man  you would have brought me shame  when the gods are hurting me already 
3836,i am in mourning for an absent master  raising his pigs for other men to eat 
3837,my lord is lost and maybe even hungry  in lands where the people speak in foreign tongues if he is even still alive  still seeing the sunlight 
3838,well now  follow me  old man  fill up on food and wine  then tell me where you come from  and the troubles you have borne 
3839,the noble swineherd heaped up cushy brushwood  and spread a furry goatskin over it his own bed blanket  thick and warm 
3840,odysseus sat down and was delighted at this welcome 
3841,he said  may zeus and all the deathless gods reward you with your heart s desire  because you welcomed me so willingly 
3842,and you  eumaeus  answered  one must honor guests and foreigners and strangers  even those much poorer than oneself 
3843,zeus watches over beggars and guests and strangers 
3844,what i have to give is small  but i will give it gladly 
3845,life is like this for slaves  we live in fear  when younger men have power over us 
3846,my real lord is kept from home by gods 
3847,he would have taken care of me  and given what kindly owners give to loyal slaves  a house with land  and wife whom many men would want as recompense for years of labor which gods have blessed and made to prosper 
3848,master would have been good to me  if he had stayed here till old age 
3849,he must be dead by now 
3850,damn helen and her family  so many have died for her sake 
3851,master went to troy 
3852,to win back agamemnon s honor  fighting the trojans 
3853,then he belted up his tunic and hurried to the pen  and chose two piglets 
3854,inside he butchered them  singed off the bristles  chopped up the meat and roasted it on skewers 
3855,he set it  piping hot  before his guest  sprinkling barley on the top 
3856,he mixed wine in an ivy bowl  as sweet as honey  and then sat down across from him  and urged  now  guest  eat up  this is a poor slave s meal 
3857,a suckling pig 
3858,the suitors eat the hogs 
3859,their hearts have no compassion  they ignore the gods  who watch and hate such crimes and bless good deeds and justice 
3860,even cutthroat pirates  who go to plunder other people s lands  seizing the spoils that zeus has granted them  and sail home in a ship filled full of treasure even they feel the watchful eyes of gods 
3861,these suitors must have heard some god s voice saying  odysseus has died 
3862,so they refuse
3863,to go back to their own homes or to arrange suitable marriages 
3864,instead they sit  wasting his wealth on feasts 
3865,each night and day they butcher sheep  not one but dozens of them  and pour out yet more wine for reckless drinking 
3866,those selfish oafs  my lord was very rich  no others on the mainland or back here in ithaca  nor twenty all combined  possessed as much 
3867,i will list all of it 
3868,twelve herds of cattle on the mainland  twelve
3869,of sheep  and twelve of pigs  and twelve of goats 
3870,he had to hire more laborers to help us 
3871,and out here on the far end of the island  eleven herds of goats are grazing  watched by good men 
3872,every day  a herdsman takes whichever goat seems fattest and most healthy up to the palace 
3873,i  who watch these pigs  must choose the best for them 
3874,odysseus gratefully wolfed the meat and drank the wine in silence 
3875,he was hatching plots to ruin
3876,the suitors 
3877,after he had had enough to eat  he took the wine cup he had drunk from  filled it again and gave it to eumaeus  who took it gladly 
3878,then odysseus said  friend  who bought you 
3879,this rich  noble man that you describe who is he 
3880,you say he died in the war for agamemnon s honor 
3881,perhaps i know him  since he must be famous 
3882,zeus and the other gods will be aware if i have seen him and can bring you news 
3883,he traveled widely 
3884,but the swineherd said  his wife and son will not trust travelers who claim to bring them news 
3885,tramps always lie to get a meal they have no because to tell the truth 
3886,all those who pass through ithaca go to my mistress spinning foolish tales 
3887,she welcomes them and questions them  while tears stream from her eyes  and rightly so  a wife should mourn for her dead husband 
3888,sir  you also would weave tall tales if you got clothes for it 
3889,but in reality  my master s skin has been ripped off his bones by birds of prey and dogs  his life is gone 
3890,or he has been eaten at sea by fish  his bones are lying upon the beach  heaped high with sand 
3891,his death is ruin for us all  especially me  since i will never have so kind a master  however far i go  not even if i go back to the home of my own parents who gave me birth and brought me up 
3892,i wish
3893,that i could see them  in my native land 
3894,but i grieve less for my own family than for odysseus 
3895,i miss him so 
3896,i hesitate to call him by his name  stranger  i would prefer to call him brother  even when he is far away  because he loved and cared for me with so much kindness 
3897,odysseus was self restrained 
3898,he said  my friend  you are so adamant  insisting that he will not come back 
3899,you have no faith 
3900,but this is no tall tale  i swear to you odysseus is on his way 
3901,and when he is in his own house  then i will claim my prize as messenger some better clothes 
3902,till then  i will take nothing  though i need them 
3903,i hate like hades gates the man who caves to poverty  and starts to lie 
3904,i swear by zeus  and by the welcome that you gave me  and by the hearth of great odysseus  where i am going  all this will turn out
3905,as i say now 
3906,odysseus will come  within this very cycle of the moon  between the waning and the waxing time  he will come home  and pay back all those here who disrespect his wife and noble son 
3907,you answered him  swineherd eumaeus  sir  i will not give you this reward  since he will not come home 
3908,relax and drink 
3909,let us think about other things 
3910,do not remind me  my heart is troubled when a person mentions
3911,my faithful master 
3912,never mind your oath 
3913,i hope he comes  as do penelope and old laertes and telemachus 
3914,may it come true 
3915,but i cannot forget my grief for that poor boy  my master s son 
3916,thanks to the gods  he grew up like a tree  handsome and strong  as if to match his father when he becomes a man  but somebody or some god ruined his good sense 
3917,he went to pylos  seeking news about his father 
3918,the suitors lie in wait for when he comes back home  and soon arcesius line will be wiped out on ithaca 
3919,no more 
3920,they may catch him  or he may get away  kept safe by zeus 
3921,now tell me  sir  the truth about your own adventures 
3922,where are you from 
3923,where do your parents live 
3924,where is your town 
3925,on what boat did you sail here 
3926,how did sailors bring you to ithaca 
3927,and who were they 
3928,i know you did not reach this land by foot 
3929,odysseus said cunningly  i will tell you the truth  the whole truth 
3930,how i wish we two could sit at ease here in this cottage  and we had food and sweet strong wine to last as long as we desired  while all the work was done by others  even if i talked a whole year  i would not complete the story of everything the gods have made me suffer 
3931,proudly i say  i come from spacious crete  the son of wealthy castor hylacides 
3932,whose sons by his main wife were numerous  raised in his house 
3933,my mother was a slave  bought as a concubine  and yet my father respected me like all his other sons 
3934,the cretan people held him in high honor as if he were a god  since he was rich and had such noble sons 
3935,but fate arrived to take him down to hades 
3936,then my brothers selfishly seized his property  and gave only a tiny part to me  with barely
3937,a place to live 
3938,but i was not a weakling  or cowardly in fighting 
3939,my great skill and talent helped me win a wife who had a decent dowry all lost now 
3940,but you can see in stubble how the grain once grew  though i am crushed by grief 
3941,i have the gift of courage from athena and from ares 
3942,whenever i chose warriors to ambush our enemies  i never thought of death 
3943,i leapt out far in front  and ran to catch them
3944,and spear them 
3945,that was how i was in war 
3946,i did not like farmwork or housekeeping  or raising children 
3947,i liked sailing better  and war with spears and arrows  deadly weapons 
3948,others may shudder at such things  but gods made my heart love them 
3949,people s preferences are different 
3950,before the greeks went off to march on troy  i led my troops and fleet on nine forays  with great success 
3951,i had my pick of all the spoils  and got much more
3952,when we shared out the winnings 
3953,soon my house grew rich  i was a fine  important man among the cretans 
3954,but far seeing zeus arranged that expedition of disaster  which made so many men collapse and fall 
3955,the people wanted me to sail to troy with idomeneus 
3956,we had no choice  their will was strong  constraining us 
3957,we greeks fought for nine years  and in the tenth we sacked the town of priam  and sailed home 
3958,some god
3959,scattered the greeks  and i was cursed by zeus 
3960,i stayed for just one month at home  enjoying my children and my wife and my possessions 
3961,some impulse made me want to sail to egypt  with nine ships and a godlike crew 
3962,i rushed to get the fleet prepared and gather up the men 
3963,i paid for many animals  to kill as sacrifices for the gods and for the men to cook and eat 
3964,we feasted six days  then on the seventh we embarked
3965,and sailed from crete 
3966,a fair north wind was blowing so we could drift on easily  like floating downstream 
3967,no one got sick  and all our ships came through undamaged 
3968,we sat tight  and let the wind and pilot guide us over seas 
3969,in five days we had reached the river valley of egypt  my fleet docked inside the nile 
3970,i told the loyal men to wait and guard the ships while i sent scouts to check around from points of higher ground 
3971,but they indulged
3972,their own aggressive impulses  and started willfully doing damage to the fields of egypt and enslaved the little children and women  and they killed the men 
3973,the news soon reached the city  people heard the screaming  and right away at dawn  they all arrived 
3974,the plain was filled with warriors on foot  and chariots and gleaming bronze  and zeus  the lord of lightning  caused my men to panic 
3975,they dared not keep on fighting  danger lurked
3976,on every side 
3977,then many of my men were killed with sharp bronze spears  the rest were taken as slaves to work for them 
3978,i wish i too had died in egypt  but more pain remained 
3979,zeus put another plan into my mind 
3980,i took my helmet off my head and dropped my shield and sword  and unarmed i approached the king 
3981,beside his chariot i grasped his knees and kissed them 
3982,he was merciful  he kept me safe  and took me home with him 
3983,riding his chariot 
3984,my eyes were wet 
3985,many egyptians were enraged with me  and tried to kill me with their spears  the king protected me he feared the wrath of zeus  the god of strangers  who hates wickedness 
3986,i stayed there seven years and gained great wealth  all the egyptian people gave me gifts 
3987,but in the eighth  an avaricious man came from phoenicia 
3988,he was good at lying  skilled and well practiced at exploiting people 
3989,he tricked me into going off with him back to phoenicia  where he lived 
3990,i stayed a year  but when the hours and days and months had rolled around again  he made me sail over the seas to libya  pretending that i would go with him to do some trading 
3991,his true plan was to sell me for a profit 
3992,i had suspicions  but i climbed on board 
3993,the ship sailed out with fair north wind behind her from crete out into open sea 
3994,but zeus
3995,planned to destroy the crew 
3996,on leaving crete  no other land was visible  but only the sea and sky 
3997,zeus set a dark blue cloud across our ship that cast a shadow over the sea 
3998,he thundered and then hurled a bolt of lightning at the ship 
3999,the impact whirled the ship right round and filled her up with sulfur 
4000,the men fell overboard and all were swept away by waves  like cormorants beside the dark ship  and gods took away their chance
4001,of getting home 
4002,but in my desperation zeus rescued me  he put the sturdy mast into my hands 
4003,i clung to it and drifted  propelled by storm winds for nine days 
4004,and on the tenth black night  the rolling waters swept me towards thesprotia 
4005,there the king  named pheidon  helped me without expecting recompense because his son had found me all worn out  chilled by the morning air 
4006,he took my hand  raised me and led me to his father s house 
4007,and dressed me  that was where i heard about odysseus the king said he had been a guest there on his journey home 
4008,the king showed me the treasure that odysseus had gathered  gold and bronze and hard worked iron 
4009,the royal stores contained enough to feed his family for ten more generations 
4010,odysseus  the king said  had gone off to dodona  to ask the holy oak what zeus intended 
4011,he had been too long
4012,away from fertile ithaca 
4013,he wondered how best to get back home in some disguise or openly 
4014,the king then swore to me  pouring libations  that he had a boat prepared and crew picked out  to take him back to his dear homeland 
4015,but he sent me first  it happened some thesprotians were already sailing towards grain rich dulichium 
4016,the king told them to treat me well and take me to king acastus 
4017,but their hearts preferred
4018,to bring me once again to misery 
4019,after the ship was out upon the sea  they plotted to enslave me  they stripped off my cloak and tunic  and tossed me these rags in which you see me now 
4020,and when night fell they came to ithaca s bright fields  and tied me tightly with rope and left me on the ship  and quickly went ashore to get some dinner 
4021,the gods themselves unloosed my bonds  they slipped easily off 
4022,i pulled my ragged clothes
4023,over my head  slid down the smooth ship s plank and plunged chest forward in the sea 
4024,i swam fast with both arms  and quickly got away 
4025,i came ashore beside a flowering thicket and huddled there in fear 
4026,they stomped around  shouting  but in a while they gave up looking  and got back on the ship 
4027,the gods themselves hid me with ease  and brought me to this cottage a wise man s home because it is my fate to stay alive 
4028,eumaeus  you replied 
4029,poor guest  your tale of woe is very moving  but pointless  i will not believe a word about odysseus 
4030,why did you stoop to tell those silly lies 
4031,i know about my master s homecoming 
4032,the gods detest him  they loathe him  since they did not let him die at troy or in his friends arms  when the war was winding up  so that the greeks could build a mound to glorify him and his son in times to come 
4033,the robber winds have snatched him 
4034,he has no glory now 
4035,i am a loner  i live here with the pigs  and do not go to town  except when wise penelope calls me to share some news 
4036,the people cluster around her  asking questions some in sorrow about their absent master  others glad to eat at his expense 
4037,i ask no questions  since an aetolian fooled me with his lies 
4038,he came to my house  saying he had killed a man in distant parts and run away 
4039,i welcomed him 
4040,he said that he had seen odysseus with idomeneus in crete  repairing ships that storms had wrecked 
4041,he promised that my lord would come in summer or harvesttime  made rich by heaps of treasure  his crew complete 
4042,a god has brought you here  but do not try to trick me or make nice with lies 
4043,i will be kind to you  old man  not for your stories  but in fear of zeus  the god of strangers  and because i feel
4044,pity for you 
4045,but sly odysseus answered  you are too skeptical  despite my oath  i see you will not trust me  may the gods of mount olympus be our witness that if your master ever comes back home to this house  you will give me clothes to wear  and help me to dulichium i want to go there 
4046,but if he does not arrive  and i am wrong  your slaves can drive me over the cliff tops  so no other beggar tries
4047,to trick you 
4048,but the upright swineherd answered  yes  guest  i would be praised enormously among all men  now and in times to come  if i took you inside and welcomed you  then murdered you  and doing this  with what clean conscience could i pray to zeus 
4049,in any case  now it is dinnertime 
4050,my men should come inside  so we can cook delicious food 
4051,that was their conversation 
4052,in came the herdsmen  and they drove the pigs
4053,into their usual pens to rest  there rose a mighty din of grunting pigs 
4054,the noble swineherd addressed his men 
4055,bring out the best pig for our guest  who comes from distant lands 
4056,and let us all enjoy ourselves 
4057,we suffer in bitter toil for these white tusked pigs  while others eat the food we labor for  and give us nothing 
4058,with a keen bronze axe he chopped the wood 
4059,they brought a fattened pig of five years old and put it on the altar 
4060,the swineherd s heart was good  he kept in mind the gods 
4061,he shaved the bristles off its head  and threw them in the fire  and prayed to all the gods  that through his ingenuity  his master would come home 
4062,he stretched up tall  and used a piece of oaken firewood to strike 
4063,the life departed  and they slit the throat and singed the hide  and chopped it up 
4064,the swineherd made an offering of meat  laid flesh across the fine rich fat  and put it
4065,upon the fire with barley grain on top  and sliced the rest and put it all on skewers  and roasted it with care  then drew the meat off and heaped it high on platters 
4066,next he stood and served it out in seven equal parts  the first with prayers  for hermes and the nymphs  and then he served the others to the men 
4067,he gave odysseus the piece of honor  cut from the spine 
4068,his master was delighted  and said  eumaeus  may zeus bless and love you
4069,as i do  since you give me such good things 
4070,you answered him  swineherd eumaeus  eat  dear guest  enjoy it  simple though it is  gods give  gods take away  as is their will  to gods all things are possible 
4071,with that  he made the sacrifices to the gods  poured a libation from the bright red wine  then gave odysseus  the city sacker  the cup 
4072,at last the swineherd sat to eat 
4073,mesaulius served the food that was the slave
4074,bought by eumaeus in his master s absence  with no help from his mistress or laertes 
4075,he traded him from taphians 
4076,they all reached out to take the good things set before them 
4077,when they had had enough of food and drink  mesaulius cleared things away  the men were full of bread and meat  and wanting sleep 
4078,night fell  a moonless  bitter night 
4079,zeus rained continually  wet zephyr blew his hardest 
4080,odysseus to test out if eumaeus
4081,was kind enough to take his own cloak off  or tell another man to do it said  eumaeus and you others  all of you 
4082,i want to brag a little 
4083,i am dizzy  under the influence of wine  which makes even the wisest people sing and giggle  and dance  and say things best not spoken 
4084,since i have begun this blabbering  here goes  i will be honest 
4085,i wish i was young and strong again  as when we planned an ambush
4086,under the walls of troy the leading men were menelaus and odysseus  and i was chosen as the third commander 
4087,when we had reached the city wall  we lay in bushes  reeds  and marshes  hiding under our shields 
4088,night fell  harsh and icy cold  with north wind and a sleetlike snow  so cold the ice grew on our weapons 
4089,all the others had cloaks  they slept in comfort  tucked beneath their shields 
4090,but i had foolishly forgotten
4091,my cloak and left it  not expecting cold 
4092,i carried just my shield and shining belt 
4093,in the last part of night  as stars were setting  i went near to odysseus and nudged him 
4094,he listened to me carefully 
4095,i said  your majesty  odysseus  great general  i am about to die from this cold weather  i have no cloak 
4096,some spirit tricked me into wearing my tunic only  now there is no way to fix it 
4097,instantly he thought
4098,of this solution 
4099,what a strategist and fighter  very quietly he whispered  hush now  do not let any of the others hear you 
4100,he propped his head up on his elbow  and told them  listen  friends 
4101,i had a dream sent by the gods 
4102,we moved too far away from where the ships are 
4103,someone needs to speak to agamemnon  shepherd of the people  and tell him to send more troops here 
4104,at that  thoas the son of andraimon leapt up 
4105,took off his purple cloak and sprinted down towards the ships 
4106,i snuggled down in comfort under his cloak till golden dawn shone bright 
4107,if only i was young and strong again  then one of these pig keepers on this farm would give a cloak to me  both from respect and friendship 
4108,as it is  they all despise me for wearing dirty rags 
4109,eumaeus  you replied  that was a splendid tale  old man  it worked 
4110,you will get all the clothes and things
4111,a poor old beggar needs at least for now 
4112,but in the morning  you will have to put your old rags on again 
4113,we only have one outfit each  no spares 
4114,my master s son will give you clothes when he arrives  and help you to travel on wherever you desire 
4115,with that  he stood and set a bed for him beside the fire  and threw on it some skins of sheep and goats 
4116,odysseus lay down 
4117,eumaeus tucked him in a big thick cloak 
4118,his extra one  for really bitter weather 
4119,odysseus went to sleep  the young men slept beside him 
4120,but the swineherd did not like to sleep so distant from the pigs  he started to leave 
4121,odysseus was glad the slave took good care of his absent master s things 
4122,eumaeus slung his sharp sword belt across his well toned back  and wrapped around himself his windproof cloak and fine big furry goatskin 
4123,he took a sharpened knife to ward away
4124,humans or dogs  and he went off to sleep out where the pigs with silver tusks were sleeping  a hanging rock protected them from wind 
4125,the prince returns athena went to sparta  to ensure the safe return of prince telemachus 
4126,she found him with pisistratus  both lying on menelaus porch  and nestor s son was fast asleep  but no sweet slumber held telemachus 
4127,his worries for his father kept him awake all through god given night 
4128,owl eyed athena stood by him and said  telemachus  you should no longer travel so far from home  abandoning your wealth 
4129,with greedy men at home 
4130,you must watch out  they may divide and eat up all your wealth  and make your journey useless 
4131,quickly ask for help from menelaus to get home  so you may find your mother safe and blameless 
4132,her father and her brothers are already telling her she should wed eurymachus 
4133,he is the one most generous with gifts to her and to her father 
4134,do not let her take any items from the house  without
4135,your full consent 
4136,you know how women are they want to help the house of any man they marry 
4137,when one darling husband dies  his wife forgets him  and her children by him 
4138,she does not even ask how they are doing 
4139,let your best slave girl watch your property  until the gods give you your own wife 
4140,also  i have more news  take note 
4141,there is a gang of suitors lurking in the stream between your ithaca and rocky same  who
4142,have plans to kill you on your journey home 
4143,but i suspect that some of those who waste your wealth will soon be lying under earth 
4144,now steer your ship far distant from the islands  and sail both day and night 
4145,some god who guards and watches over you will send fair wind behind your sails 
4146,when you first reach the shore of ithaca  your men must drag the ship up to the town  while you first go and visit the swineherd  who is better than most slaves 
4147,spend the night there 
4148,tell him to go to town to tell penelope that you have come safely back home from pylos 
4149,with these words the goddess went back up to mount olympus 
4150,he woke the son of nestor with a kick  and said to him  pisistratus  go fetch the horses  get them harnessed to the carriage  and let us hurry on our way 
4151,he answered  telemachus  this is impossible  for us to drive when it is pitch black night 
4152,however eager we may be to travel 
4153,dawn will come soon 
4154,wait till great menelaus comes out to bring us presents in his carriage  and sends us on our way with friendly words 
4155,a generous host is sure to be remembered as long as his guests live 
4156,then all at once dawn on her golden throne lit up the sky 
4157,king menelaus got up from the bed he shared with fair haired helen and approached them 
4158,seeing him on his way  telemachus
4159,put on his bright white tunic  and then slung his mighty sword across his sturdy shoulders 
4160,so in a warlike guise  the well loved son of godlike king odysseus stood near and spoke to menelaus 
4161,royal son of atreus  now  please  send me home now  to my beloved country 
4162,my heart yearns to go back home 
4163,and menelaus answered  telemachus  i will not keep you here if you are truly desperate for home 
4164,i disapprove of too much friendliness and of too much standoffishness 
4165,a balance is best 
4166,to force a visitor to stay is just as bad as pushing him to go 
4167,be kind to guests while they are visiting  then help them on their way 
4168,so friend  remain just till i fetch some splendid gifts to pile onto your carriage 
4169,wait till you see them  i will instruct the women to prepare a banquet in the hall from our rich stores 
4170,feasting before a long trip brings you honor  it also makes good sense 
4171,and if you want to have me travel with you all through greece  i shall yoke up my horses and escort you through every town  and everywhere we go we will be given gifts a fine bronze tripod  a cauldron  or two mules  or golden cups 
4172,telemachus replied  king menelaus  i want to go home right away 
4173,i have no one back there to watch my property 
4174,i would not want to die while i am searching for father  or to lose my wealth at home 
4175,so general menelaus shouted out to tell his wife and female slaves to make a feast from his rich stores 
4176,eteoneus got out of bed and came he lived nearby 
4177,the general boomed out orders  light the fire and roast the meat  the slave obeyed 
4178,meanwhile  his master went inside the fragrant room containing treasures 
4179,helen went with him 
4180,and megapenthes 
4181,there he took a goblet  two handled  and he told his son to bring a silver bowl 
4182,and helen stood beside the chests in which she kept the special clothes that she had worked with her own hands 
4183,she lifted the most elaborate and largest robe that shone like starlight under all the rest 
4184,then they went through the palace till they reached telemachus 
4185,and fair haired menelaus said to him  may great zeus  the lord of thunder 
4186,husband of hera  make your wish come true may you go back home safely 
4187,i will give you the best of all my treasure  as a mark of deep respect  a bowl of solid silver  circled with gold  hephaestus fashioned it 
4188,the king of sidon  phaedimus  bestowed it on me when i was at his house  en route for home 
4189,now take it  it is yours 
4190,he gave the goblet first  and megapenthes brought the shining silver bowl and put it down
4191,in front of him 
4192,then helen s lovely cheeks flushed as she moved in close 
4193,she held the robe and said  sweet boy  i also have a gift  crafted by my own hands 
4194,remember helen when your own wedding day at last arrives  and let your bride wear this 
4195,until that time  your mother should take care of it 
4196,i wish you great joy 
4197,i hope you reach your well built home  and fatherland 
4198,she handed it to him  he took it gladly 
4199,prince pisistratus
4200,took all the gifts and packed them in the luggage  and marveled at them in his heart 
4201,the king led them inside  they sat on chairs 
4202,a slave girl brought out a beautiful gold water pitcher and silver bowl so she could wash their hands 
4203,she set a polished table at their side 
4204,another lowly girl brought bread and food of every kind 
4205,boethoedes began to carve and serve the meat 
4206,the king s son poured the wine for everyone 
4207,they helped themselves
4208,to all the delicacies spread before them 
4209,when they were satisfied  telemachus and nestor s son strapped on the horses harness  and yoked them to the chariot and drove off from the echoing portico and gate 
4210,but menelaus ran up just behind them  holding a golden cup of honeyed wine in his right hand  so they could pour libations before they left 
4211,he stopped in front of them and spreading wide his arms said  boys  good luck 
4212,give nestor my best wishes he was always as kind as any father while we greeks were making war in troy 
4213,telemachus said carefully  yes  king  when we go there we will pass on what you have said 
4214,i hope i may go back to ithaca and meet odysseus good luck to match my fortune in all your generosity and kindness 
4215,then on the right an eagle flew  it held a big white goose clutched in its claws a tame one 
4216,caught from the yard 
4217,the people  men and women  were running round and yelling after it 
4218,it darted on the right beside the boys  and flew before their horses 
4219,they were all delighted 
4220,nestor s son was first to speak 
4221,my lord  king menelaus  what do you think 
4222,was this a sign sent by some god for us 
4223,or sent for you 
4224,and menelaus  favorite of ares  wondered how he ought to answer 
4225,but helen cut in first and said  now listen 
4226,and i will make a prophecy 
4227,the gods have put it in my heart and i believe it will come true 
4228,just as the eagle flew down from the mountains where he has his home with chicks and parents  seizing this tame goose so will odysseus  who has been gone so long and has endured so much  come back and take revenge 
4229,indeed  he is already at home and planting ruin for the suitors 
4230,telemachus replied  may thundering zeus
4231,fulfill your prophecy at once  if so  i would bow down to you as to a goddess 
4232,he whipped the horses and they galloped off through the town center to the open plain 
4233,all day the harness rattled as they ran 
4234,but when the sun went down and it grew dark  they came to pherae  home of diocles  son of ortilochus  who was the son of alpheus 
4235,he welcomed them and there they spent the night 
4236,when rosy fingered dawn
4237,the early born appeared  they yoked the horses  climbed in the chariot  and drove away from the resounding portico and gate 
4238,the horses flew with gusto at the whip 
4239,soon they were near the rocky town of pylos 
4240,telemachus then asked pisistratus  would you do me a favor 
4241,we are friends because our fathers have been friends forever  and we are age mates  and this trip has made us even more intimate 
4242,please do not bring me
4243,beyond my ship  but leave me here  in case the old man forces me to visit him and be his guest 
4244,i long to get back home 
4245,i have to go  and fast 
4246,the son of nestor wondered how he should best respond 
4247,he thought upon reflection he should turn the horses back to the ship and shore beside the sea 
4248,there he took out the splendid gifts and clothes and gold from menelaus  and he packed them inside the stern  and told telemachus 
4249,hurry  embark now  get your crew in too  before i get back home and tell my father that you are here 
4250,i know him  he is stubborn 
4251,he will not let you go  he will come here to fetch you  and he surely will not leave without you 
4252,he will be in such a rage  with that  he spurred the horses 
4253,long manes flowing  they galloped to the citadel of pylos 
4254,telemachus gave orders  make it all shipshape  my friends  and get on board  so we
4255,can start our journey 
4256,quickly they obeyed and sat along the benches 
4257,as he worked  with prayers and sacrifices to athena  a foreigner approached him  who had killed a man in argos and had run away 
4258,he was a prophet and descended from melampus  who once lived in pylos  land of sheep 
4259,melampus had been rich  and owned a palace  but he left his home  escaping from neleus  a proud  important man 
4260,who seized all his great wealth while he was trapped and tortured in the house of phylacus  because a fury put inside his mind a dangerous obsession with the daughter of neleus 
4261,he managed to escape  and drove the cattle  lowing loudly  off from phylace to pylos 
4262,he avenged the wrong that neleus had done to him  and brought the woman to his brother s house as wife  then went to argos  home of horses 
4263,since there it was his destiny to rule the multitude of argives  and he had two strong sons  mantius  and antiphates  who fathered the heroic o cles  whose son was amphiaraus  the warlord  whom zeus who holds the aegis and apollo adored wholeheartedly 
4264,but he did not live to old age  since he was killed at thebes  because his wife took bribes 
4265,he had two sons  amphilochus and alcmaeon 
4266,the sons
4267,of mantius were clitus  snatched by dawn to join the gods  because he was so handsome  and polypheides  whom apollo gave the best prophetic skill of any mortal after amphiaraus had died 
4268,this prophet grew angry with his father  and migrated to hyperisia  and there he told fortunes for everyone 
4269,it was his son  named theoclymenus  who had approached telemachus while he was pouring wine
4270,and praying to the gods 
4271,the stranger said  my friend  i find you making sacrifices 
4272,i beg you  by religion  by the gods  and by your life and your men s lives  who are you 
4273,who are your parents 
4274,what is your home town 
4275,telemachus said  stranger  i will tell you 
4276,i come from ithaca  my father is odysseus he was 
4277,he must have died some dreadful death by now 
4278,it was for him i got this ship and crew 
4279,i sailed to seek
4280,news of my absent father 
4281,and the stranger replied  i too am far from home 
4282,i killed a man of my own tribe  and i have many brothers and kinsmen  powerful in argos  so i am on the run 
4283,they want to kill me  i have been doomed to homelessness 
4284,but please  let me on board your ship 
4285,i come to you in desperation otherwise i will surely be killed 
4286,those men are after me  telemachus said  yes  you can join us
4287,on board our ship 
4288,and what we have is yours  you are our guest 
4289,he took the stranger s spear  laid it on deck  then climbed on board himself  sat at the stern  and had his guest sit down beside him at the stern 
4290,they loosed the ropes 
4291,telemachus gave orders to the men to seize the tackle  promptly they obeyed  and raised the wooden mast and fastened it into the socket  binding it with forestays  and hauled the white sail up with leather cables 
4292,sharp eyed athena sent fair wind that gusted a wild explosive breath through bright clear sky  the ship began to race across the sea  past crouni and the lovely streams of chalcis 
4293,the sun went down and all the world was dark 
4294,impelled by wind from zeus  the ship sped on past phaea and they came to famous elis ruled by the epeians  from there they steered towards the needle islands  still unsure if they would die 
4295,meanwhile  odysseus
4296,was having dinner with the noble swineherd inside the cottage  and the other men were eating with them 
4297,after they were done  odysseus began to test the swineherd  to see if he would be hospitable  and ask him to stay there  out on the farm  or send him into town 
4298,he said  eumaeus  listen  and listen all of you 
4299,at dawn i plan to go to town to beg i have no wish to be a burden to you all 
4300,i only need directions and a guide who can go with me  i will roam around the city on my own  in search of drink and crusts of bread so it must be 
4301,and if i reach the house of king odysseus  i plan to tell penelope my news  and mingle with the high and mighty suitors  they may give me some food from their rich stores 
4302,i could do anything they want at once 
4303,i have the capability  you see 
4304,hermes the messenger  the god who gives favor and glorifies all human labor  has blessed me with unrivaled skill in all domestic tasks  fire laying  splitting logs  carving and roasting meat  and pouring wine i can do all the chores poor people do to serve the rich 
4305,but angrily you said  eumaeus  no  why would you think of this 
4306,you would be killed if you set foot among that horde of suitors  their aggression reaches
4307,the iron sky 
4308,and those who wait on them are not like you 
4309,they are young men  well dressed  with bright clean hair and handsome faces  serving the bread and wine and meat  piled high upon their polished tables 
4310,stay here 
4311,no one minds your presence not myself  nor my companions 
4312,and when odysseus son arrives  he will provide a proper cloak and tunic  and help you travel where your heart desires 
4313,odysseus  experienced in pain 
4314,answered  i hope zeus loves you as i do  since you have saved me from the agonies of wandering 
4315,the worst thing humans suffer is homelessness  we must endure this life because of desperate hunger  we endure  as migrants with no home 
4316,but since you now want me to stay and wait for your young master  tell me about odysseus parents 
4317,his father  when he left  was on the threshold of age 
4318,are they alive still 
4319,have they died 
4320,he answered  stranger  i will tell you truly 
4321,laertes is alive  but he is always praying to zeus to let him pass away in his own home 
4322,he feels such desperate grief about his son and his beloved wife  whose death made him so heartbroken  he aged before his time 
4323,she died a dreadful death  a death i would not wish for any friend grieving her absent son  the famous hero 
4324,while she was still alive  despite her sadness 
4325,she used to like to talk and chat with me she brought me up herself with her own daughter  strong  pretty ctimene  her youngest child 
4326,she raised us both together  treating me almost as equal  just a little less 
4327,and when we came of age  they sent the girl to same  for a hefty bridal price 
4328,the mother dressed me in fine clothes  a cloak and tunic  tying sandals on my feet  and sent me to the country 
4329,but she still
4330,loved me with all her heart 
4331,i miss them both 
4332,the blessed gods have made my work here prosper  so i have had enough to eat and drink and give to guests 
4333,but i hear no good news about my mistress 
4334,ruin has befallen the house from those invaders 
4335,all her slaves miss talking to their owner  getting gossip  sharing some food and drink with her  and taking scraps to the fields with them the kind of thing that makes slaves happy 
4336,and odysseus
4337,exclaimed  eumaeus  what a little child you were when you were taken far from home and from your parents  tell me more 
4338,did they live in a city that was sacked 
4339,or was it bandits that found you  herding sheep or cows alone 
4340,did they seize hold of you and put you onto their ship  and sell you for a profit in this man s house 
4341,the swineherd answered him  since you have asked this question  stranger  listen  enjoy my story  sitting quietly 
4342,drinking your wine 
4343,these nights are magical  with time enough to sleep and to enjoy hearing a tale 
4344,you need not sleep too early  it is unhealthy 
4345,any other man who feels the need of sleep should go lie down  get up at dawn  have breakfast  and go herd the master s pigs 
4346,but let us  you and i  sit in my cottage over food and wine  and take some joy in hearing how much pain we each have suffered 
4347,after many years
4348,of agony and absence from one s home  a person can begin enjoying grief 
4349,i will tell you my story as you ask 
4350,there is an island you may know it called syria  where the sun turns round  above ortygia 
4351,it has few inhabitants  but it is good land  rich in sheep and wine and grain  no famine ever hurts those there  nor any deadly sickness 
4352,they grow old  and with their gentle arrows  artemis
4353,and silver bowed apollo because their death 
4354,the land is split into two provinces  my father ctesius was king of both 
4355,then avaricious merchants came phoenicians  skilled sailors  with great piles of treasure stored in their black ship 
4356,and in my father s house there was a woman from phoenicia tall and beautiful and skilled in many arts 
4357,those clever rascals tricked her 
4358,one of them first found her washing clothes beside the ship
4359,and lay with her 
4360,sex sways all women s minds  even the best of them 
4361,and then he asked her where she was from and who she was  she showed him my father s palace  and she said  i am from sidon  rich in bronze 
4362,i am the daughter of wealthy arybas  as i was walking back from the fields one day  some taphian pirates kidnapped me  brought me here to this man s house  and sold me to him  for a tidy sum 
4363,her secret lover said  then would you like
4364,to go back home with us  and see your parents and your fine home again 
4365,they are alive and quite rich now 
4366,the woman said  oh  yes  i would  if all you sailors swear an oath to bring me safely home 
4367,at that  they swore as she had asked  and made their solemn vows 
4368,and then the woman said  you must keep mum  and none of you can even speak to me if you bump into me beside the road or at the water fountain otherwise
4369,someone might tell the old man at the house 
4370,then he would get suspicious  chain me up  and plan to have you killed 
4371,remember this  bear it in mind and do your trading quickly  and when your ship is full of stores to take back home with you  send news to me  and fast 
4372,i will bring gold with me as well  whatever wealth i can find to hand 
4373,i also want to give another gift to pay my fare 
4374,i take care of my master s clever son
4375,who always runs around outside with me  i will bring him on board and he will fetch a pretty price from foreigners 
4376,with that  she went back to the palace 
4377,for a year they stayed with us accumulating wealth by trading  and they filled their ship s hold up 
4378,when it was time to go  they sent a man to tell the woman at my father s house 
4379,he was a very cunning man  he wore a golden necklace strung with amber beads 
4380,the slave girls in the palace and my mother stared and began to finger it and ask how much it cost  he nodded to the woman in silence  and then went back to the ship 
4381,she took me by the hand and led me out into the forecourt  where she found some cups left on the tables by my father s men who had been banqueting  and now had gone to council they were having a debate 
4382,she took three cups and hid them in her dress
4383,and carried them away with her 
4384,i followed  knowing no better 
4385,as the sun went down  we hurried through the dark streets to the harbor 
4386,there was the swift phoenician ship 
4387,they all embarked  put us on board as well  and sailed over the watery waves  zeus sent fair wind 
4388,for seven days we sailed and on the eighth  artemis struck the woman with her arrows 
4389,she crashed into the ship s hold like a seagull 
4390,they threw her overboard to feed the fish
4391,and seals  and i was left there  brokenhearted 
4392,the current carried them to ithaca  and then laertes bought me with his wealth 
4393,that was the way my eyes first saw this land 
4394,odysseus replied  my heart is touched to hear the story of your sufferings  eumaeus 
4395,in the end  though  zeus has blessed you  since after going through all that  you came to live with someone kind  a man who gives you plenty to eat and drink 
4396,your life is good 
4397,but as for me  i am still lost  i trekked through many towns before i wandered here 
4398,so went their conversation  then they slept for just a little while  dawn soon arrived upon her throne 
4399,meanwhile  telemachus drew near the mainland 
4400,lowering the sail nimbly  his men took down the mast and rowed to anchorage 
4401,they cast the mooring stones  and tied the cables from the stern  then climbed out in the surf  and waded into shore 
4402,there they made dinner  mixing bright red wine 
4403,when they had had enough to eat and drink  the boy said sensibly  you all should drag the ship towards the town  while i go visit the herdsmen in the fields of my estate 
4404,then i will come to town  at evening time 
4405,at dawn  i will provide a feast for you of meat and wine 
4406,then theoclymenus asked him  but where shall i go  my dear boy 
4407,to whose house 
4408,one of those who rule this land 
4409,or should i go at once to your own mother in your house 
4410,and telemachus replied  well  ordinarily i would invite you 
4411,we are good hosts 
4412,but as it is best not  for your own sake 
4413,i will not be at home  and mother will not see you  she is weaving upstairs upon her loom she does not want the suitors seeing her 
4414,so i suggest you go to someone else s house  the son of skillful polybus  eurymachus 
4415,the ithacans look at him as a god 
4416,he is the dominant suitor and the keenest on marrying my mother and acquiring the riches of odysseus 
4417,zeus knows the future  he alone 
4418,eurymachus may die a dreadful death before that marriage 
4419,as he said this  a bird flew on his right  a hawk  apollo s messenger 
4420,it clutched a pigeon in its talons  feathers scattered between the ship and young telemachus 
4421,then theoclymenus called him aside and grasped him by the hand  and said to him  telemachus  some god has sent this bird to fly on your right hand 
4422,i knew at once it was a sign 
4423,no family in all of ithaca has greater power  you are the kings forever 
4424,he replied  oh  stranger  i hope your words come true  if so  i would give you so many gifts to show my friendship that everyone you met would be impressed 
4425,and then he told his faithful man  piraeus  you were most trustworthy of those who came with me to pylos 
4426,let this stranger come to your own house  be kind to him and give him a cordial welcome till i come 
4427,piraeus answered  however long you are away  i will take care of him 
4428,and then he climbed aboard and told the men to come as well  and loose the cables  which they did  and sat down on the benches 
4429,then telemachus
4430,tied on his sandals  and took from the deck his sharp bronze spear 
4431,the men untied the ropes and sailed towards the town  just as the son of great odysseus had ordered them 
4432,the boy walked quickly till he reached the farmyard 
4433,hundreds of pigs were there and with them slept the swineherd who knew how to help his masters 
4434,father and son at dawn the swineherd and odysseus made breakfast  lit the fire  and sent the herdsmen out with the pigs that they had rounded up 
4435,the dogs  that as a rule would bark at strangers  were quiet when they saw telemachus  they panted at him 
4436,when odysseus saw how they acted  and heard footsteps coming  he said  eumaeus  someone must be coming a friend or somebody you know the dogs are friendly  with no barking 
4437,i can hear
4438,footsteps 
4439,he hardly finished  when his son  his own dear son  was there inside the gate 
4440,amazed  the swineherd jumped up  letting fall the cups in which he had been mixing wine  it spilled 
4441,he ran towards his master  kissed his face and shining eyes and both his hands  and wept 
4442,just as a father  when he sees his own dear son  his only son  his dear most precious boy  returned from foreign lands after ten years of grieving for his loss 
4443,welcomes him  so the swineherd wrapped his arms around godlike telemachus and kissed him  as if he were returning from the dead 
4444,with tears still in his eyes he said  sweet light  you have come back  telemachus 
4445,i thought that i would never see you anymore  after you sailed to pylos 
4446,my dear child  come in  let me enjoy the sight of you now you are back 
4447,come in  you do not often come to the countryside to see us herders 
4448,you stay in town to watch that evil horde of suitors 
4449,and telemachus replied warily  grandpa  yes  i will come in 
4450,i came to see you here with my own eyes  and hear if mother still stays in the house  or if some other man has married her already  and odysseus bed is empty  full of ugly spiderwebs 
4451,the swineherd  the commander  said  indeed  her heart is loyal 
4452,she is in your house 
4453,weeping by night and sad by day 
4454,he took telemachus sword  the boy came in  crossing the stony threshold  and his father offered his seat 
4455,telemachus refused  saying  you sit there  stranger 
4456,i can find a chair around my hut 
4457,the slave can help 
4458,odysseus went back and sat back down 
4459,the swineherd spread fresh brushwood and a fleece on top  so that telemachus could sit 
4460,he set the bread in baskets and brought meat  left over from the meal the day before 
4461,he mixed some wine up in a wooden bowl  and sat down opposite odysseus 
4462,they reached to take the good things set before them 
4463,when they were satisfied  telemachus turned to the noble swineherd 
4464,tell me  grandpa  where did this stranger come from 
4465,by what route did sailors bring him here 
4466,and who were they 
4467,he surely did not walk to ithaca 
4468,eumaeus answered  i will tell you  child 
4469,he is from crete 
4470,he says he wandered  lost through many towns so some god spun his fate 
4471,now he has run away from the thesprotians who brought him  and arrived here on my farm 
4472,he is all yours  your suppliant  to treat however you desire 
4473,telemachus said anxiously  this news of yours  eumaeus  is very worrying to me  how can i invite him to my house 
4474,i am too young
4475,to fight back with my fists if someone picks a fight with me  my mother is unsure if she should stay with me and show respect towards her husband s bed and public gossip  and keep on taking care of things at home  or marry one of them  whichever suitor asserts himself  and brings most lavish gifts 
4476,but since this man has come here  to your house  i will dress him in fine clothes  cloak and tunic  and sandals for his feet  and give a sword 
4477,and help him on his way 
4478,if you are willing  keep him here in the farmhouse  care for him 
4479,i will send you some clothes and all his food  so he will be no bother to these men or you 
4480,i will not let him go to meet the suitors  they are much too violent 
4481,i would be mortified if they abused him 
4482,it would be difficult for one man  even a strong one  to do anything to them 
4483,they are too many 
4484,then odysseus 
4485,frustrated  said  my friend  it is my duty to speak out when i hear the dreadful things those suitors have been doing in your house  against your will  it breaks my heart 
4486,you are a good man  tell me  did you choose to let them bully you 
4487,have the ithacans been turned against you by some god 
4488,or do you blame your brothers  who should be a man s supporters when conflict comes 
4489,if only i had youth to match my will  i wish i were the son
4490,of great odysseus or that i were the man himself come home from wandering 
4491,we can still hope 
4492,let someone chop my head off  if i would not destroy them when i came inside the palace of odysseus  and if i lost since i am only one against so many i would rather die in my own house  than watch such crimes committed  strangers dishonored  slave girls dragged around  raped in my lovely home  men wasting wine
4493,and bread for nothing  for this waiting game  telemachus said soberly  i will explain the situation to you  stranger 
4494,the ithacans are not my enemies  and i do not have brothers i can blame 
4495,zeus gave my family a single line  arcesius had just one son  laertes  who had odysseus  his only son  and he had me  his only son  whom he left back at home  he had no joy of me 
4496,and now there are so many cruel invaders  since all the toughest men from all the islands from same and dulichium and wooded zacynthus  and all those who hold command in rocky ithaca  have come to court my mother  wasting all my wealth 
4497,she does not refuse the awful prospect of remarriage  nor can she end the courtship 
4498,they keep eating  consuming my whole house  and soon they may destroy me too 
4499,these things lie with the gods 
4500,now grandpa  you must hurry to the queen  and tell her i am safe back home from pylos 
4501,i will stay here while you tell her just her  do not let any others hear the news  since many people want to plot my death 
4502,eumaeus  you replied  i understand 
4503,but tell me  on this same trip  should i go and tell poor old laertes 
4504,for a while he used to watch the fields and join the slaves for dinner at the house  when in the mood 
4505,despite his grief for lost odysseus 
4506,but since your ship set sail away to pylos  they say he has stopped eating  will not drink  and does not go to check the fields 
4507,he sits  weeping and sobbing  worn to skin and bone 
4508,telemachus said calmly  that is sad  distressing news 
4509,but no  leave him alone 
4510,if human wishes could come true  my first would be to have my father come back home 
4511,take her your message  hurry back  and do not
4512,trail round the countryside to look for him 
4513,tell mother she should send a girl in secret to run to old laertes with the news 
4514,at that  the swineherd tied his sandals on  and started off towards the town 
4515,athena noticed him leaving from the yard  and stood beside him as a woman  tall and skillful  and beautiful 
4516,odysseus could see her  standing beside the entrance to the cottage 
4517,telemachus could not  the gods are not
4518,equally visible to everyone 
4519,the dogs could see her but they did not bark 
4520,they whimpered and slunk back across the room in fear 
4521,she raised her eyebrows  with a nod  he understood and came out  past the wall  and stood beside her 
4522,then athena told him  odysseus  great strategist  it is time for your son to know the truth  together you have to plan how you will kill the suitors 
4523,then both of you go into town 
4524,i will
4525,join you there soon myself  indeed i am itching to fight 
4526,and then athena touched him  using a golden wand  and dressed him up in fine clean cloak and tunic  and she made him taller and younger looking 
4527,he became tanned  and his cheeks filled out  and on his chin the beard grew dark 
4528,and so her work was done  and off she flew 
4529,odysseus went in 
4530,his son was startled and looked down  afraid in case it was a god 
4531,his words flew out 
4532,stranger  you look so different from before 
4533,your clothes  your skin i think that you must be some god who has descended from the sky 
4534,be kind to us  and we will sacrifice  and give you golden treasures 
4535,pity us  long suffering odysseus replied  i am no god 
4536,why would you think such things 
4537,i am your father  that same man you mourn 
4538,it is because of me these brutal men are hurting you so badly 
4539,then he kissed
4540,his son and cried  tears pouring down his cheeks  he had been holding back till then 
4541,the boy did not yet trust it really was his father  and said  no  you are not odysseus  my father  some god must have cast a spell  to because me further pain 
4542,no mortal man could manage such a thing by his own wits  becoming old and young again unless some god appeared and did it all with ease 
4543,you certainly were old just now  and wearing
4544,those dirty rags 
4545,now you look like a god 
4546,artful odysseus said sharply  no  telemachus  you should not be surprised to see your father 
4547,it is me  no other is on his way 
4548,i am odysseus 
4549,i suffered terribly  and i was lost  but after twenty years  i have come home 
4550,as for the way i look athena did it 
4551,the goddess can transform me as she likes  sometimes a homeless beggar  then she makes me
4552,look like a young man  wearing princely clothes 
4553,for heavenly gods it is not difficult to make a mortal beautiful or ugly 
4554,with that  he sat back down 
4555,telemachus hurled his arms round his father  and he wept 
4556,they both felt deep desire for lamentation  and wailed with cries as shrill as birds  like eagles or vultures  when the hunters have deprived them of fledglings who have not yet learned to fly 
4557,that was how bitterly they wept 
4558,their grieving
4559,would have continued till the sun went down  but suddenly telemachus said  father  by what route did the sailors bring you here  to ithaca 
4560,and who were they 
4561,i know you did not walk 
4562,odysseus replied  son  i will tell you everything 
4563,phaeacians  famous for navigation  brought me here 
4564,they always help their guests travel onward 
4565,i slept as their ship sped across the ocean  they set me down on ithaca  still sleeping 
4566,they brought me marvelous gifts of gold and bronze and clothing  which are lying in a cave  since gods have willed it so 
4567,athena told me to come here and make plans with you to kill our enemies 
4568,how many suitors are there 
4569,what kind of men are they 
4570,i am well known for my intelligence  and i will plot to work out if we two alone can fight them  or if we might need others helping us 
4571,telemachus considered  then said  father 
4572,i always heard how excellent you are  at fighting with a spear  and making plans 
4573,but what you said just now it is too much 
4574,we cannot fight  the two of us  against such strong men  and so many there are dozens  not just a handful 
4575,let me tell you quickly the number of the suitors 
4576,fifty two came from dulichium  all top notch fighters  who brought six henchmen 
4577,twenty four men came from same  twenty more from zacynthus 
4578,and from right here on ithaca came twelve  all strong young men 
4579,they have a house boy with them  named medon  and a poet  and two slaves well trained in carving meat 
4580,if we attack when all those men are crowded in the house  i am afraid you will be paying back their violence at all too high a price 
4581,think harder  can we find some kind of helper  willing to fight for us 
4582,odysseus said  do you think athena and her father 
4583,zeus  would be strong enough to keep us safe 
4584,would any other help be necessary 
4585,telemachus replied  the ones you mention are good defenders 
4586,they sit high among the clouds  and they control both men and gods 
4587,the veteran odysseus replied  those two will quickly join the heat of battle when we begin to grapple with the suitors  when in my house the god of war is testing our fighting force and theirs 
4588,go back at dawn 
4589,and join those overconfident young men 
4590,the swineherd will escort me into town 
4591,i will again be looking like a beggar 
4592,if they abuse me and you see me suffer  you must restrain yourself  repress your feelings  even if they are pelting me with weapons  and even if they grab me by the foot to hurl me out 
4593,just watch  and keep your temper 
4594,politely tell them they should stop this folly 
4595,they will ignore you 
4596,truly now their day
4597,of doom is near at hand 
4598,now listen hard 
4599,athena  my best co conspirator  will nudge my heart  and i will nod to you 
4600,then you must find all weapons in the house that could be used for fighting  go and hide them away inside the upstairs storage room 
4601,and when the suitors ask where they have gone  fob them off  saying  they were near the fire  so i removed them from the breath of smoke  since they were getting damaged  they were losing
4602,the luster that they used to have  before odysseus went off to troy 
4603,praise zeus  i thought of something even more important  if you get drunk you may start quarreling  and hurt each other 
4604,then your lovely dinners and courtship will be ruined 
4605,arms themselves can prompt a man to use them 
4606,tell them that 
4607,leave out two swords  two spears  and two thick shields for you and me to grab before we rush to ambush them 
4608,athena will bewitch them 
4609,helped by sharp witted zeus 
4610,and one more thing  if you are my true son  of my own blood  let no one know that i am in the house 
4611,laertes and the swineherd must not know  nor any of the slave girls  and not even penelope  until we have determined the women s attitude 
4612,we also must test the male slaves  and see who has respect and fears me in his heart  and who does not  and who looks up to you as you deserve 
4613,his glowing son said  father  you will see my courage in the moment 
4614,i am tough 
4615,but it would take too long to go around and test each man like that  and all the while  the suitors would be sitting in your house  wasting your wealth with heedless partying 
4616,so reconsider 
4617,i agree you should find out about the women which of them are innocent  and which dishonor you 
4618,however  i have no desire to traipse
4619,around to test the men  we can do that later  if zeus reveals a sign to you 
4620,such was their conversation 
4621,then the ship in which telemachus had gone to pylos docked in the bay of ithaca s main town 
4622,they disembarked and dragged the ship onto shore 
4623,the slaves brought out the splendid gifts and weapons and took them to the house of clytius 
4624,a messenger was sent to tell the queen telemachus was back in ithaca 
4625,and that he said that they must come to town  dragging the ship  in case she had been weeping in her anxiety about her son 
4626,the swineherd and this messenger met up  on the same mission  to inform the queen 
4627,when both of them arrived  the slave girls clustered around the messenger 
4628,he said  great queen  your dear son has come home  and then the swineherd took her aside and told her what her son had ordered him to say 
4629,when he was done 
4630,he walked out through the hall and out the courtyard  leaving the palace hall to join his pigs 
4631,the suitors were upset and down at heart 
4632,eurymachus the son of polybus said  friends  the journey of this upstart boy succeeded  we were sure that he would fail 
4633,we must launch our best ship  equipped with rowers  to speed across the ocean to the others and tell them to come home at once 
4634,his words were hardly finished when amphinomus
4635,spotted a ship inside the harbor  pointed away from land  the sails were being furled  the men were carrying the oars 
4636,he laughed triumphantly and said  no need to send a messenger  they are already back  some god has told them  or they saw his ship approaching  but could not catch up with it 
4637,so leaping up  they went down to the seashore  and dragged the black ship up onto dry land  and servants proudly brought the weapons out 
4638,they all went crowding to the marketplace  together  and banned any other men from joining them  both young and old 
4639,and then antinous addressed them 
4640,how amazing  the gods have saved this man from death  for days our scouts took turns to watch from windy cliffs 
4641,and when the sun went down  we never spent a night on shore  but sailed to wait till dawn at sea in ambush for telemachus  to make sure we would catch him 
4642,now some god
4643,has brought him home 
4644,we need to make new plans to murder him 
4645,he must not get away 
4646,he will obstruct our courtship if he lives  since he is wise to us  and he will plot  and now the people will be turned against us 
4647,telemachus will gather them  he must be furious  and he will not postpone action 
4648,he will stand up and tell them how we planned to murder him  but failed to do so 
4649,when they hear of our crimes  they will condemn us 
4650,we may get hurt or driven from our land  to foreign territories  we must stop it  catch him out in the countryside  away from town  or on the road 
4651,let us rob him  and share his wealth and property among us and let his mother  and whichever man marries her  keep the house 
4652,but if you think it would be better if we let him live  and keep his father s riches for himself  we should stop flocking here to waste the wealth
4653,inside his house 
4654,we should each go and court her from home  by sending gifts 
4655,one day  the lady will marry  and the lucky man will be the one who sends the most gifts 
4656,they were silent 
4657,but then amphinomus  the famous son of nisus  spoke 
4658,he had come from the wheat fields and pastures of dulichium  with others 
4659,he was intelligent  penelope preferred his speeches over other men s 
4660,wisely he said  my friends  i for my part
4661,have no desire to kill telemachus 
4662,it is a dreadful thing to kill a person of royal blood 
4663,so first we must discover the gods intentions 
4664,if great zeus decrees it  i will kill him myself  and urge you all to join me  if the gods do not approve  i say we must not do it 
4665,so he spoke  and they agreed with what he said 
4666,they stood  and went back to odysseus house  and sat on polished chairs 
4667,penelope
4668,decided she must show herself to these ungentlemanly suitors  since she had found out about the plot to kill her son medon had heard their plans  and he told her 
4669,her women at her side  she went downstairs  into the hall  approached them and then stopped  standing beside the doorpost with a veil across her face 
4670,she told antinous  you are a brute  a sneak  a criminal  the people say you are the smartest boy
4671,of all those your own age on ithaca 
4672,it is not true 
4673,you are insane  how could you devise a plan to kill telemachus 
4674,do you have no respect for ties created by supplication  which zeus watches over 
4675,have you forgotten that your father came here  running in terror from the ithacans  who were enraged because he joined the pirates of taphos  and was hounding the thesprotians  our allies 
4676,so the ithacans were eager
4677,to kill him  rip his heart out  and devour his wealth 
4678,odysseus protected him  now you consume your benefactor s wealth  and court his wife  and try to kill his son  and you are hurting me  i tell you  stop  and make the other suitors stop as well 
4679,he said  penelope  you need not worry 
4680,put all this from your mind 
4681,there is no man and never will be  who can harm your boy while i am still alive upon this earth 
4682,i swear to you  if someone tries  my sword will spill his blood  your city sacking husband often would take me on his lap  and give me tidbits of meat with his own hands  and sips of red wine 
4683,so telemachus is now the man i love the most in all the world 
4684,the boy is in no danger  not from us there is no help for death brought by the gods 
4685,he spoke to mollify her  all the while he was devising plans to kill her son 
4686,she went up to her light and airy bedroom  and wept for dear odysseus  her husband  until athena gave her eyes sweet sleep 
4687,as evening fell  the swineherd came back home to find odysseus 
4688,he and his son had killed a year old pig and made a meal 
4689,athena came beside odysseus and touched him with her wand again to make him ragged and old  to make sure when the swineherd came in  he would not recognize his master 
4690,in case he told penelope the secret 
4691,he came inside 
4692,telemachus spoke first 
4693,eumaeus  you are back  what is the news in town 
4694,are those proud suitors in my house  back from the ambush  or still lurking there to catch me on my way back home 
4695,eumaeus answered  i did not want to trek through town asking that question 
4696,i preferred to share my news as fast as possible and then come back 
4697,one of your own men went with me 
4698,a messenger  he told your mother first 
4699,i saw one more thing  as i passed the hill of hermes  right above the town i saw a ship draw into harbor  full of men and loaded up with shields and spears 
4700,i thought it could be them  but i cannot be sure 
4701,then prince telemachus began to smile and met his father s eyes  he did not let eumaeus see 
4702,when they were finished cooking  they shared the dinner equally  and all
4703,had plenty  then they took the gift of sleep 
4704,insults and abuse when newborn dawn appeared with hands of flowers  telemachus  odysseus son  fastened his handsome sandals on his feet  took up his sturdy spear that fit his hand  and headed out 
4705,he told the swineherd  grandpa  i must go into town  to see my mother 
4706,until we meet  i think she will not stop her lamentations  tears  and bitter sobbing 
4707,now i need you to take this poor old stranger to town to beg his supper  any man
4708,who feels like it can feed him 
4709,i cannot put up with everyone right now  i have too many worries 
4710,if he gets annoyed  the worse for him 
4711,i always like to tell the honest truth 
4712,odysseus replied  my friend  i do not even want to stay 
4713,beggars should wander round the town and country 
4714,i will get food from charitable people 
4715,i am too old to stay here as a farmhand  obeying orders from an overseer 
4716,this man will take me  as you told him to  as soon as i have warmed up by the fire 
4717,i only have these rags  the morning frost may do me in you say the town is far 
4718,at that  telemachus strode quickly out  thinking about his plan to hurt the suitors 
4719,and when he reached the royal house  he propped his spear against a pillar  and went in  across the stony threshold 
4720,eurycleia the nurse  was first to notice his arrival 
4721,as she was laying fleeces on the chairs 
4722,weeping  she rushed at him 
4723,the other women owned by strong willed odysseus assembled and kissed telemachus head and shoulders to welcome him 
4724,then wise penelope came from her bedroom  looking like a goddess  like artemis or golden aphrodite  and flung her arms around her darling son  and wept 
4725,she kissed his face and shining eyes  and through her tears her words flew out 
4726,you came 
4727,telemachus  sweet light  i was so sure that i would never see you anymore after you sailed to pylos secretly  not telling me  to get news of your father 
4728,tell me  what have you seen 
4729,telemachus said calmly  mother  do not try to make me upset  or stir my feelings 
4730,i survived the danger 
4731,go upstairs and take your bath  put on clean clothes and take your women with you into your bedroom 
4732,sacrifice and pray
4733,to all the gods  that one day zeus may grant revenge 
4734,now i am going into town 
4735,i will invite the stranger who arrived right after me on ithaca 
4736,i sent him ahead  with my brave men  and told piraeus to take him home and treat him with all kindness until i come 
4737,his flying words hit home 
4738,she washed  put on clean clothes  and prayed to all the gods  and made them lavish sacrifices  asking that one day zeus would bring revenge 
4739,telemachus took up his spear and marched out through the hall  two swift dogs at his side 
4740,athena poured unearthly grace upon him 
4741,everyone was amazed to see him coming 
4742,the suitors gathered round and spoke to him in friendly tones  at heart  they meant him harm 
4743,keeping away from most of them  he joined mentor and antiphus and halitherses  who were his father s friends from long ago 
4744,they questioned him in detail 
4745,then piraeus
4746,approached with theoclymenus  the stranger whom he had brought through town towards the center 
4747,at once telemachus set out and rushed to stand beside the stranger 
4748,and piraeus spoke first 
4749,telemachus  send women quickly to my house  so i may give back the gifts that menelaus gave you 
4750,but with caution telemachus replied  piraeus  no 
4751,we do not know exactly what will happen  and if the suitors in my house by stealth
4752,should kill me and divide my father s wealth between themselves  i would prefer that you enjoy the gifts than any of those men 
4753,and if i kill them  planting doom among them  bring me the gifts  and we will both be happy 
4754,with this  he led the weary stranger back to his house  where he laid their cloaks across chairs  they went to bathe 
4755,the slave girls washed them  rubbed them with oil  and dressed them in wool cloaks and tunics 
4756,then they left the baths and sat
4757,on chairs 
4758,a girl brought out a golden pitcher and poured the washing water on their hands  over a silver bowl 
4759,she set a table beside them  and a humble slave girl brought a generous array from their rich stores 
4760,penelope was leaning on a chair beside the door  facing telemachus  spinning fine strands of wool 
4761,they helped themselves to food and drink 
4762,when they had had enough  penelope  preoccupied  spoke up 
4763,telemachus  i will go upstairs now  to lie down on my bed  which has become a bed of mourning  always stained with tears  since my odysseus went off to troy with those two sons of atreus 
4764,but you have failed to tell me if you gathered news about your father s journey home  now tell me  before the suitors come 
4765,telemachus answered her calmly 
4766,mother  i will tell you 
4767,we went to pylos  visiting king nestor 
4768,he made me very welcome in his palace  under his roof  as if i were his son returning after many years away 
4769,he cared for me like one of his own sons 
4770,but he said he had not heard anything from anyone about odysseus  alive or dead 
4771,he sent me on  with horses and carriage  to the son of atreus  great general menelaus 
4772,there i saw helen for whose sake  by the will of gods 
4773,the greeks and trojans suffered through the war 
4774,when menelaus asked why i had come to glorious sparta  i told him the truth in detail  and he answered  stupid cowards  the bed they want to lie down in belongs to someone truly resolute 
4775,as when a deer lays down her newborn suckling fawns inside the leafy den of some fierce lion  and goes off to the slopes and grassy valleys to graze 
4776,then he comes back to his own bed
4777,and cruelly destroys both little ones 
4778,so will odysseus destroy them all 
4779,by father zeus  athena  and apollo  i pray he is as strong as long ago  on lesbos  when he wrestled philomedes and hurled him to the ground  and all the greeks cheered 
4780,may he fight the suitors that same way  so all of them will find their courtship ends badly  and their lives soon 
4781,and i will answer your questions frankly  and tell what i learned
4782,from the old sea god  who can tell no lies 
4783,he said he saw him in distress  the nymph calypso has him trapped upon her island  inside her house 
4784,he cannot come back home to his own country  since he has no fleet or crew to row across the sea s broad back 
4785,that was what famous menelaus said 
4786,my tasks accomplished  i sailed off 
4787,the gods gave me fair wind which swiftly brought me home 
4788,his story stirred emotions in her heart 
4789,then godlike theoclymenus spoke up 
4790,my lady  wife of great odysseus  this news is incomplete 
4791,i will reveal the whole truth with a prophecy 
4792,i swear by zeus and hospitality and by the hearth of great odysseus  the place where i have come  he is already here in ithaca at rest or on his way 
4793,he must have learned what bad things they are doing  and he is plotting ruin for them all 
4794,i know because i saw a sign while sitting on board the ship i told telemachus 
4795,penelope said carefully  well  stranger  i hope this does come true 
4796,i would reward you with so much warmth and generosity that everyone you met would see your luck 
4797,meanwhile  outside odysseus house  the suitors relished games of darts and discus  playing outside as usual  with no thought of others 
4798,then at dinnertime  when flocks
4799,of sheep were trekking home from every field  led by their shepherds  medon spoke 
4800,he was the suitors favorite slave boy  whom they always brought to their feasts 
4801,my lords  you have enjoyed your games 
4802,now come inside to eat 
4803,there is no harm in having meals at proper times 
4804,they followed his advice  stood up and went inside the palace 
4805,they spread out their cloaks over the chairs  and killed plump goats  large rams  some fatted pigs  and one domestic cow 
4806,and cooked them for the feast 
4807,odysseus was making haste to leave the countryside for town 
4808,the swineherd spoke in lordly tones 
4809,stranger  my master says that you can come to town today  as you desire though i would rather leave you here to watch the farm 
4810,but i am nervous that the master may reproach me  and a master s curses fall heavily on a slave 
4811,now we must go 
4812,the hour is late and it will soon get colder 
4813,the sun is sinking low 
4814,odysseus answered  i understand 
4815,we can go now  you lead the way 
4816,but if you have a stick  give it to me to lean on  since i hear the path is slippery 
4817,with that  he slung his bag across his shoulders by its string 
4818,it was all tattered  full of holes 
4819,eumaeus gave him a serviceable stick 
4820,they left  the dogs and herdsmen stayed to guard the farm 
4821,the swineherd led his master into town
4822,resembling a poor old beggar  leaning upon a stick and dressed in dirty rags 
4823,they walked along the stony path  and near the town  they reached an ornate fountain  flowing with clear streams  where the people came for water 
4824,it had been built by ithacus  neritus  and polyctor 
4825,a circle of black poplars grew round it  nurtured by the spring 
4826,cool water poured from the rocks above 
4827,there was an altar built over it in honor of the nymphs 
4828,all passersby made offerings to them 
4829,melanthius the son of dolius  with two more herders  met them there 
4830,he was driving the finest goats to feed the suitors 
4831,on seeing them  he spoke abusively  in brash  offensive language that enraged odysseus 
4832,one scoundrel leads another  makes sense  gods join like things with like 
4833,you foul pig man  where are you taking this old swine 
4834,a scrounger  who will rub on many doors 
4835,demanding scraps  not gifts for warriors 
4836,if you let me have him to guard my farm  and muck the pens and toss the kids their fodder  he could drink whey and fatten his stick legs 
4837,but he does not want work 
4838,he likes to traipse around the town and beg for chow to stuff his greedy belly 
4839,i predict  if he reaches the palace of odysseus  a mass of hands will hurl stools at his head  to pelt him through the house and bruise his ribs 
4840,with that  he sauntered past him  and lunged out to kick him on the hip bone 
4841,what a fool  odysseus was not pushed off the path  he stood there fixed in place  and wondered whether to rush at him  armed with his stick  and kill him  or grab him by the ears and push him down onto the ground 
4842,instead  he braced himself and kept his temper 
4843,when the swineherd saw melanthius insulting him  he prayed  arms high 
4844,o fountain nymphs  o zeus daughters 
4845,if ever king odysseus brought bones of lamb and goat in luscious fat for you  then now fulfill my prayer  may spirits guide him home  my master will put paid to all the bluster of this rude man  who loafs round town and let us the animals be ruined by bad herders 
4846,melanthius the goatherd sneered at him  oh  very nice  this dog knows how to talk  and it has learned some tricks 
4847,one day i will take him by ship and row him far away
4848,from ithaca  and get a heap of treasure by selling him 
4849,i wish apollo would shoot silver arrows at telemachus tomorrow in his house  or that the suitors would kill him 
4850,i am sure odysseus is far away and never coming back 
4851,with that  he left them they were walking slowly  and he rushed on ahead of them 
4852,he went inside his master s house  and sat among the suitors  with eurymachus  his favorite 
4853,the slaves brought out a piece of meat for him  and a submissive house girl brought him bread 
4854,the swineherd and odysseus went in  and stood  surrounded by the strumming sound of the resounding lyre that phemius was tuning for his song 
4855,odysseus grabbed at the swineherd s hand and said  eumaeus  this is odysseus splendid palace 
4856,it could be recognized among a thousand 
4857,the rooms are all connected  and the courtyard
4858,is fenced in by a wall with cornices  and there are sturdy double doors 
4859,no man could break through here 
4860,i notice many men are feasting  i smell meat  and hear the lyre  which gods have made companion to the feast 
4861,eumaeus answered  right  you are perceptive 
4862,now we must plan 
4863,will you go inside first to join the suitors  while i stay out here 
4864,or do you want to wait  and i will go 
4865,but do not stay too long 
4866,if someone sees you 
4867,you will be pelted  maybe beaten up 
4868,unflappable odysseus said  yes  i thought of that 
4869,you go  i will stay here 
4870,i have been hit before 
4871,i know hard knocks 
4872,i am resilient 
4873,i suffered war and being lost at sea 
4874,so let this be 
4875,there is no way to hide a hungry belly 
4876,it is insistent  and the curse of hunger is why we sail across relentless seas  and plunder other people 
4877,as they spoke 
4878,argos  the dog that lay there  raised his head and ears 
4879,odysseus had trained this dog but with no benefit he left too soon to march on holy troy 
4880,the master gone  boys took the puppy out to hunt wild goats and deer and hares 
4881,but now he lay neglected  without an owner  in a pile of dung from mules and cows the slaves stored heaps of it outside the door  until they fertilized the large estate 
4882,so argos lay there dirty 
4883,covered with fleas 
4884,and when he realized odysseus was near  he wagged his tail  and both his ears dropped back 
4885,he was too weak to move towards his master 
4886,at a distance  odysseus had noticed  and he wiped his tears away and hid them easily  and said  eumaeus  it is strange this dog is lying in the dung  he looks quite handsome  though it is hard to tell if he can run  or if he is a pet  a table dog 
4887,kept just for looks 
4888,eumaeus  you replied  this dog belonged to someone who has died in foreign lands 
4889,if he were in good health  as when odysseus abandoned him and went to troy  you soon would see how quick and brave he used to be 
4890,he went to hunt in woodland  and he always caught his prey 
4891,his nose was marvelous 
4892,but now he is in bad condition  with his master gone  long dead 
4893,the women fail to care for him 
4894,slaves do not want to do their proper work  when masters are not watching them 
4895,zeus halves our value on the day that makes us slaves 
4896,with that  the swineherd went inside the palace  to join the noble suitors 
4897,twenty years had passed since argos saw odysseus  and now he saw him for the final time then suddenly  black death took hold of him 
4898,telemachus first saw the swineherd coming 
4899,he gave a nod to tell him to come over 
4900,glancing around  eumaeus saw the stool used by the boy who carved the suitors meat 
4901,he picked it up and set it down beside telemachus table 
4902,there he sat  the slave boy brought him meat and bread 
4903,and then odysseus approached and stepped inside  looking like some poor homeless sad old man  he hobbled on his stick  then slumped himself down on the ash wood threshold  leaning back against the cypress doorpost  which a workman
4904,had smoothed and straightened long ago 
4905,the boy summoned the swineherd over  and picked up a wheat loaf from the basket and as much meat as his hands could hold  and gave it to him 
4906,he said  please take this food out to that stranger  and tell him he should walk around the hall and beg from all the suitors  shame is not a friend to those in need 
4907,the swineherd went and told odysseus  telemachus gives you this food and says you ought to beg
4908,from all these suitors  shame  he says  is not fitting for those who have to live by handouts 
4909,odysseus prayed cautiously  o zeus  bless this telemachus  and may he have all that his heart desires 
4910,and with both hands he took the food and set it at his feet  on top of his old ragged bag  and ate  and listened to the singer in the hall 
4911,as he was finishing  the music stopped  the suitors shouted  and athena stood
4912,beside odysseus  and prompted him to go among the suitors  begging scraps  to find out which of them were bad or good although she had no thought of saving any out of the massacre which was to come 
4913,he went around and begged from left to right  holding his hand out  like a practiced beggar 
4914,they gave him food in pity  and they wondered who this man was and whereabouts he came from 
4915,they asked each other  and melanthius 
4916,the goatherd  said  you suitors of the queen  listen to me about this stranger here 
4917,i saw this man before  the swineherd brought him 
4918,i know no more  i do not know his background 
4919,antinous began to scold the swineherd 
4920,pig man  you famous idiot  why did you bring this man here 
4921,do we not have already plenty of homeless people coming here to spoil our feasts 
4922,is it not bad enough that they crowd round and eat your master s wealth 
4923,you had to ask this other one as well 
4924,eumaeus  you replied  antinous  you are a lord  but what you say is trash 
4925,who would invite a stranger from abroad unless he had the skills to help the people a prophet  or a doctor  or a builder  or poet who can sing and bring delight 
4926,no one would ask a beggar  they bring only their hunger 
4927,out of all the suitors  you are meanest to the slaves  especially me 
4928,but if the prudent queen and godlike prince still live here in this house  i do not mind 
4929,telemachus said  shush 
4930,antinous does not deserve an answer 
4931,he is always picking a fight  and goading on the others 
4932,then turning to antinous  he said  you care for me so nicely  like a father  you told me i should force the stranger out 
4933,may no god make that happen  go to him and give him something  i can spare the food 
4934,go on  i tell you  you should pay no heed to mother or the other household slaves belonging to my father 
4935,you were not concerned about them anyway 
4936,you want to gorge yourself  not share with other people 
4937,antinous replied  you little show off  what nasty temper  what an awful comment  if all the suitors gave the same as me  this house could keep him checked for three whole months 
4938,he had a footstool underneath the table 
4939,for resting his soft feet on while he feasted  he brandished it 
4940,the others all gave food and filled the beggar s bag 
4941,odysseus had finished with his test  he could have walked back to the threshold  no harm done 
4942,instead  he stood beside antinous and said  friend  give me something 
4943,you must be the best of all the greeks 
4944,you look like royalty  so you should give more food than all the rest  and i will make you known throughout the world 
4945,i used to be a rich man  with a palace 
4946,when needy beggars came from anywhere  no matter who they were  i gave them food 
4947,my slaves were numberless  my wealth was great  i had the life men say is happiness 
4948,but zeus destroyed it all  he wanted to 
4949,he prompted me to travel with some pirates to egypt  that long journey spelled my ruin 
4950,i moored my galleys in the river nile and told my loyal men to stay and guard them 
4951,and sent out scouts to all the lookout points 
4952,but they were too impulsive  and they sacked the beautiful egyptian fields  and seized women and children  and they killed the men 
4953,the screaming reached the town  the people heard  and rushed to come and help  at dawn the plain was all filled up with foot soldiers and horses and flashing bronze 
4954,then zeus  who loves the thunder  caused panic in my men disastrous panic 
4955,danger was all around us  and not one
4956,stood firm 
4957,the sharp bronze swords killed many men  and others were enslaved as laborers 
4958,but they gave me to somebody they met  a foreigner named dmetor  king of cyprus 
4959,i came from there 
4960,such is my tale of woe 
4961,antinous replied  what god imposed this pest to spoil our feast 
4962,stay over there  not near my table or you can get lost  get killed in egypt or enslaved in cyprus  you barefaced beggar  you come up to us 
4963,and these men give you treats unthinkingly  we have so much  and people do not mind sharing another person s wealth 
4964,sharp witted odysseus drew back from him and said  you handsome idiot  you would not give a grain of salt from your own house 
4965,you sit enjoying someone else s food  and yet you will not give a crumb from this great banquet to me  antinous was furious  and scowling said  that does it  you insult me 
4966,you lost the chance to leave with dignity  he lifted up his stool and hurled it at odysseus right shoulder  near his back 
4967,it did not knock him over  like a rock he stood there  shook his head  and silently considered his revenge 
4968,then he went back  sat on the threshold and set down the bag  all full of food  and told them  listen  suitors of this world famous queen  i have to speak 
4969,when men are fighting for their own possessions 
4970,for cows or sheep  there is no shame in wounds 
4971,but now antinous has wounded me because i came here hungry  hunger brings such suffering to humans 
4972,if there are gods of the poor  or furies to avenge us  may he be struck by death  instead of marriage  he answered  stranger  shut up  or be off  if you keep talking  we young men will drag you across the palace by your hands and feet and have you flayed alive  but all the others
4973,reproached antinous insistently 
4974,you ought not to have hit a poor old beggar  if he turns out to be a god from heaven it will end badly  gods disguise themselves as foreigners and strangers to a town  to see who violates their holy laws  and who is good 
4975,antinous ignored the suitors words 
4976,the blow increased the pain inside telemachus heart  but he let fall no tears 
4977,he calmly shook his head
4978,and thought about revenge 
4979,penelope heard what had happened in the hall  and said to all her slaves  i hope apollo shoots antinous  just as he hit the beggar  and old eurynome replied  if only our prayers were answered  none of them would live to see the dawn ride in upon her throne 
4980,penelope said  yes  dear  they are all our enemies and mean to do us harm 
4981,antinous is the worst  he is like death 
4982,some poor old stranger wandered to this house and asked the men for food  compelled by need 
4983,the others helped him out and filled his bag  antinous hurled a footstool at his shoulder 
4984,she had this conversation in her room with her attendants  while odysseus was eating dinner 
4985,then she called the swineherd 
4986,eumaeus  have the stranger come to me  so i may welcome him  and ask if he has heard or witnessed anything about
4987,long lost odysseus 
4988,the stranger seems as if he must have traveled far 
4989,eumaeus replied  your majesty  i wish these men would quiet down  the tales the stranger tells would charm your heart 
4990,for three days and three nights i had him stay with me  he ran away from off a ship  and came to my house first  he started to describe his sufferings  and had not finished 
4991,like a singer  blessed by gods with skill in storytelling people
4992,watch him and hope that he will sing forever so this man s tale enchanted me  he says odysseus and he are old guest friends through their forefathers 
4993,this man lived in crete  the home of minos  and he traveled here a rambling route  with dangers compassed round 
4994,he says odysseus is still alive and near here  in the rich thesprotian land  and he is bringing home a pile of treasure 
4995,penelope said  call him over  let him
4996,tell me in person  while the suitors have their fun here in my house or at the doors  their mood is festive 
4997,in their homes they have untasted food and wine  which their house slaves devour  while they are flocking to our house each day to slaughter oxen  sheep  and goats  to feast and drink our wine  with no restraint 
4998,our wealth is decimated 
4999,there is no man here like odysseus  who could defend the house 
5000,but if odysseus comes back
5001,to his own native land  he and his son will soon take vengeance for their violence 
5002,telemachus sneezed loudly and the noise resounded through the hall 
5003,penelope laughed  and she told eumaeus  call the stranger  my son just sneezed at what i said you heard 
5004,it is a sign of death for all the suitors  no one can save them from their ruin now 
5005,but listen  if i find this stranger speaking the truth  give him nice clothes a cloak and tunic 
5006,at that  the swineherd went and stood beside odysseus 
5007,his words had wings 
5008,now sir  penelope  telemachus mother  has summoned you 
5009,she feels impelled to ask about her husband  painful though it is  if you tell her the truth and she will know you will get clothes  you desperately need them 
5010,and you can ask for food all through the town  and fill your belly 
5011,anyone who wants can give you scraps 
5012,strong willed odysseus
5013,answered  eumaeus  i will tell the truth  the whole truth  to penelope  and soon 
5014,i know about odysseus  we shared in suffering 
5015,but i am very nervous about the rowdy suitors 
5016,their aggression touches the iron sky 
5017,when i was walking across the hall just now  quite harmlessly  that man hurled something at me  and he hurt me  telemachus did nothing to protect me  and nor did anybody else 
5018,so now 
5019,tell her to stay right there until night falls  however eager she may be 
5020,at dusk  she can come nearer  sit beside the fire  and ask about her husband s journey home 
5021,i do have dirty clothes you know it well  since it was you i came to first for help 
5022,the swineherd headed back  he crossed the threshold  and sharp penelope said  are you not bringing the traveler 
5023,is something wrong 
5024,is he too scared or shy 
5025,a homeless man
5026,can ill afford such shame 
5027,eumaeus answered  his words were common sense  he wants to stay out of the suitors way  they are aggressive 
5028,he says you should stay here until sunset 
5029,it is much better for you too  my queen  to speak to him alone 
5030,penelope replied  the stranger is no fool at least 
5031,there never were such bullies as these men  and they intend us harm 
5032,the swineherd went back to the crowd of suitors  and approached
5033,telemachus  and tucked his head down close  so no one else would hear 
5034,my friend  he said  i have to go and watch the pigs  and all your property  and mine 
5035,you should take care of everything  but most of all  yourself 
5036,do not get hurt 
5037,so many mean you harm 
5038,i pray that zeus obliterates them all  before they injure us  telemachus answered  may it be so 
5039,first eat  then go  come back at dawn with animals for meat 
5040,the rest is up to me and up to gods 
5041,so then eumaeus sat down on the stool  and ate and drank  then went back to his pigs  leaving the palace full of banqueters 
5042,it was already late  past afternoon  music and dancing entertained the suitors 
5043,two beggars then came a man who begged throughout the town of ithaca  notorious for greed 
5044,he ate and drank nonstop  so he was fat but weak  with no capacity for fighting 
5045,the name his mother gave him as a child was arnaeus  but all the young men called him irus  because he was their messenger 
5046,now this man tried to chase odysseus from his own home  and cursed him 
5047,get away  old man  get out  or else you will be dragged
5048,out by the foot  do you not see the suitors winking to tell me i must throw you out 
5049,this is embarrassing for me  i must make you get up right now  or we must fight  scowling at him  odysseus said  fool  i did not do you wrong or speak against you 
5050,i am not jealous of another beggar receiving gifts  however much he gets 
5051,this doorway can accommodate us both 
5052,do not hog all the wealth  it is not yours 
5053,you seem to be a homeless man  like me  gods give all mortal blessings 
5054,do not stir me to fight or lose my temper 
5055,i am old but i will crack your ribs and smash your face to bloody pulp then i will have a day of peace tomorrow  you will not return here to the palace of odysseus 
5056,irus the vagabond was furious 
5057,this greedy pig yaks on like some old woman scrubbing an oven  i will hurt him  punch him
5058,two fisted  and rip out his teeth  as farmers pull out the tusks from pigs that damage crops 
5059,get ready  let them watch 
5060,how could you be so dumb  to pick a fight with someone younger 
5061,so on the threshold at the palace doors their furious aggression reached its peak 
5062,antinous  that saintly lord  incited the fight and with a chuckle told the suitors  my friends  we never had so fine a show brought to this house before 
5063,the gods be thanked 
5064,these two are getting ready for a brawl 
5065,quick  let us goad them on  they all jumped up  laughing  and gathered round the ragged beggars 
5066,antinous addressed them 
5067,listen  suitors  goat stomachs stuffed with fat and blood are roasting over the fire for dinner 
5068,let the beggar who wins the fight choose one of these and take it  and he can always eat with us in future  and we will let no other beggar come to share our company 
5069,they all agreed 
5070,the strategist odysseus deceived them  saying  my friends  there is no way a man as old as me  worn down by suffering  can fight a younger man  my hunger forces bad choices  tempting me to take the beating 
5071,but swear a mighty oath that none of you will step up to help irus out and hit me roughly with fists and make me lose to him 
5072,all of them swore the oath as he had asked 
5073,the holy prince telemachus said  guest 
5074,if your brave spirit urges you to fight against this challenger  you need not worry about the others 
5075,anyone who strikes you will face a multitude 
5076,i am your host  eurymachus and this antinous are sensible and they agree with me  they all consented  and odysseus took off his rags and tied them round his waist  revealing massive thighs and mighty shoulders  enormous chest and sturdy arms 
5077,athena
5078,stood near him and increased his strength  to suit the shepherd of the people 
5079,all the suitors were flabbergasted  and they said  this means the end of irus brought upon himself  what muscles underneath the old man s rags  irus was deeply troubled and afraid  his heart sank 
5080,but the house slaves made him gird his tunic and get ready 
5081,he was shaking 
5082,antinous said  haha  you big show off  you would be better dead than so afraid
5083,of some old man worn down by suffering 
5084,if this man beats you  proving he is stronger  i will toss you on board a ship and send you off to king echetus in mainland greece  the lord of cruelty and pain 
5085,he will cut off your nose and ears with pitiless bronze  and then your genitals  and he will give them raw to his dogs to eat 
5086,these words increased his shakiness 
5087,escorted to the ring  he stood 
5088,both raised their fists 
5089,odysseus 
5090,who had endured so many insults  wondered if he should hit him hard enough to kill him  or give him just a tap to knock him down 
5091,a light touch would be best  he thought  in case the suitors cottoned on 
5092,they came to blows 
5093,first irus hit odysseus shoulder  odysseus punched irus on his neck below the ear  and broke his jaw 
5094,red blood gushed from his mouth  and with a moan he fell  teeth chattering  legs flailing 
5095,then the suitors
5096,threw up their hands to cheer  and died of laughter 
5097,odysseus seized irus by the foot  dragging him through the gateway to the courtyard  and propped him by the wall 
5098,he put a staff into his hand  and said  sit there and keep the dogs and pigs away  you good for nothing  you must not bully visitors and beggars  or you will suffer even worse than this  then picking up his ragged bag  he slung it across his shoulders by the strap and sat
5099,beside the door again 
5100,the suitors went inside and raised their cups 
5101,may all the gods and zeus give you your heart s desire  that irus was sponging everywhere  the greedy pig 
5102,you put a stop to him  and we will send him to echetus  the king of mass destruction 
5103,odysseus was thrilled to hear this omen 
5104,antinous set out the big goat s stomach  stuffed full of blood and fat  in front of him 
5105,amphinomus provided two bread baskets 
5106,and a gold cup of wine  and welcomed him 
5107,sir  be our guest  and may your future luck be good  though now you have so many troubles 
5108,odysseus replied  his wits about him  amphinomus  you seem intelligent  like nisus of dulichium  your father  i heard about his wealth and excellence  and that you are his son 
5109,you are well spoken 
5110,take note of what i say 
5111,of all the creatures that live and breathe and creep on earth  we humans
5112,are weakest 
5113,when the gods bestow on us good fortune  and our legs are spry and limber  we think that nothing can ever can go wrong  but when the gods bring misery and pain  we have to bear our suffering with calm 
5114,our mood depends on what zeus sends each day 
5115,i once had what most people count as wealth  great riches 
5116,i committed many crimes  of violence  abuses of my power  abetted by my brothers and my father 
5117,no one should turn away from what is right  a man should quietly accept whatever the gods may give 
5118,i see how wickedly the suitors are behaving wasting wealth and failing to respect the wife of one who soon will come back to his family and homeland 
5119,very soon  may spirits guide you home  so you do not meet him when he comes 
5120,when he confronts the suitors in this hall there will be blood 
5121,he poured an offering
5122,of sweet wine to the gods  and took a sip  then passed the cup back to amphinomus  who took it  and then paced around the house  troubled at heart  his head bowed low  he saw the danger in his mind 
5123,but he was not fated to live  athena had condemned him to be defeated by telemachus with his strong spear 
5124,amphinomus sat down on the same chair that he sat on before 
5125,athena  with her gray eyes glinting  gave
5126,thoughtful penelope a new idea  to let the suitors see her  so desire would open up inside them like a sail  and so her son and husband would respect her 
5127,mysteriously  she laughed  and told her slave  eurynome  i have a new desire  to let the suitors see me  though i hate them 
5128,i also want to give my son advice  not to spend so much time with those proud men 
5129,they talk impressively  but their intentions
5130,are bad 
5131,eurynome replied  my child  your words make sense 
5132,but you should wash and oil your skin  not go with blotches on your face to have this conversation with your son 
5133,you should not grieve forever  and your boy is older now 
5134,you always begged the gods to let you see him grown up  with a beard 
5135,penelope replied with circumspection  eurynome  i know you care for me  but do not tell me i should wash myself
5136,and put on oil 
5137,the gods destroyed my beauty that day my husband left in hollow ships 
5138,go call my slave girls  hippodameia and autonoe they must come with me into the hall 
5139,i do not want to go to meet the men alone 
5140,it would be shameful 
5141,so the old woman went and called the girls 
5142,athena s eyes were bright with plans 
5143,she poured sweet sleep onto penelope  who lay down on her couch  her joints relaxed  she slept 
5144,athena gave her gifts of godlike power  to make the men astonished when they saw her 
5145,she put ambrosial beauty on her face  the kind that aphrodite  wreathed in myrtle  uses before she dances with the graces 
5146,she also made her shapelier and taller  and made her skin more white than ivory 
5147,the goddess left 
5148,the girls came in  their talking woke up the queen 
5149,she felt her cheeks and said  despite my bitter grief  a peaceful sleep
5150,enveloped me  if only artemis would bring me gentle death right now to end my misery 
5151,i waste my life in longing for my beloved husband  who was good at everything the best of the achaeans 
5152,she went down from her sunny room upstairs 
5153,the two slaves went with her 
5154,she reached the suitors  and stood beside the central pillar  holding her gauzy veil before her face 
5155,her two trustworthy slaves stood either side of her 
5156,the suitors weakened at the knees  desire bewitched them  and they longed to lie with her 
5157,she spoke to her dear son  telemachus 
5158,telemachus  you are not thinking straight 
5159,when you were still a child  you had good sense 
5160,now you are bigger  you have reached adulthood 
5161,you are so tall and so good looking now  people can see you are a rich man s son  even a foreigner would know at once 
5162,and yet your judgment is askew 
5163,what happened 
5164,that you allowed a guest to be insulted 
5165,if strangers in our house are so abused  what then 
5166,you will be shamed  your reputation will be destroyed  telemachus replied with calculated purpose 
5167,mother  i do not blame you for being angry 
5168,in my heart i do know right and wrong 
5169,i used to be a child  i am not now 
5170,but i cannot even afford to think my own heart s thoughts 
5171,those evil suitors keep distracting me 
5172,and i have no one on my side 
5173,this fight between the stranger and that beggar irus did not turn out as they had wished  the stranger was much the stronger 
5174,father zeus  apollo  athena  may the suitors in our house be beaten and bow down their heads  some in the house  and some outside 
5175,may each man s body grow weak like irus  out there at the gate  sitting with head slumped down  as if he were intoxicated  he cannot stand up
5176,nor go back home 
5177,his body is too frail 
5178,and then eurymachus spoke up and said  o queen penelope  wise  prudent daughter of great icarius  if all the greeks could see you now  there would be far more suitors feasting here in your house  from dawn to dusk  because no other woman equals you in beauty  stature  and well balanced mind 
5179,penelope replied with caution 
5180,no  the deathless gods destroyed my looks that day
5181,the greeks embarked for troy  and my own husband odysseus went with them 
5182,if he came and started taking care of me again  i would regain my good name and my beauty 
5183,i am weighed down by grief 
5184,a spirit set so many troubles on me  at the time that he left ithaca  my husband grabbed my wrist  took my right hand  and said to me  now wife  i do not think we armored greeks will all come home unharmed from troy 
5185,they say
5186,the trojans are good warriors with arrows and javelins  and they ride chariots drawn by swift horses  which can quickly turn the tide of war  in which so many die 
5187,some god may bring me home  or i may be captured out there in troy 
5188,i do not know 
5189,you must remember this  my parents need to be well cared for in our house  as much as now or more so with me gone away 
5190,when our son s beard has grown  you must get married
5191,to any man you choose  and leave your house 
5192,those were my husband s words 
5193,the time has come  the night when i must marry is at hand 
5194,terrible  i am cursed  zeus took away my happiness 
5195,another bitter thought oppresses me  it is not right or proper to court a decent woman in this way  a rich man s wife  competing for her hand 
5196,they ought to bring fat sheep and cows to feed my family  and give fine gifts  not eat
5197,what is not theirs  and offer nothing back 
5198,odysseus  who had endured so much  was happy she was secretly procuring presents  and charming them with pretty words  while her mind moved elsewhere 
5199,antinous said  wise penelope  take all the presents that any of the greeks would like to bring 
5200,refusing gifts is not polite 
5201,but we will not go back to our own farms or elsewhere  until you choose the best of us to marry 
5202,they all agreed and sent their men for gifts 
5203,antinous brought out a splendid robe  embroidered  with twelve brooches of pure gold pinned to the fabric 
5204,and eurymachus gave her a necklace  finely worked in gold set in with amber beads that shone like sunlight 
5205,two slaves brought earrings from eurydamas 
5206,they sparkled beautifully  and triple clusters like berries hung from each 
5207,pisander s slave brought her a lovely choker  finely made 
5208,all of the suitors gave her different gifts 
5209,the queen went upstairs to her room  her slaves carried the splendid presents 
5210,then the suitors turned back to watch the dancing and enjoy the captivating music 
5211,they stayed there in pleasure  till black evening came 
5212,they set three braziers to light the whole great hall  stuffed with dry wood  well seasoned and fresh cut  combined with kindling 
5213,the slave girls owned by firm odysseus took turns to light them 
5214,the king himself had all his wits about him  and said  slave girls  odysseus  your master  has been long gone 
5215,go back and sit beside the queen and comfort her 
5216,spin yarn or comb the wool 
5217,i can provide these men with light 
5218,if they decide to stay here till bright dawn rides on her lovely throne  i will not be defeated 
5219,i am tough 
5220,at that  the girls began to giggle  peeking at each other 
5221,pretty melantho  child of dolius 
5222,had been brought up by queen penelope  who gave her toys and treated her just like a daughter 
5223,but melantho  unconcerned about penelope  was sleeping with eurymachus 
5224,she started to insult odysseus  and taunt him 
5225,poor old stranger  you are insane  you did not want to sleep out in the smithy or the public shelter  instead  you come here talking high and mighty among this crowd of men 
5226,are you not scared 
5227,wine may have dulled your senses  or perhaps you always say such idiotic things 
5228,has your defeat of irus made you crazy 
5229,that beggar 
5230,then watch out  a better man may fight you soon  and punch your face so hard you will be kicked out of this house all drenched in blood 
5231,odysseus scowled back and said  you little dog  i will soon go and tell telemachus what you have said  so he can slice you limb from limb  that made the women
5232,tremble with fear  they thought he spoke the truth 
5233,they scattered through the house 
5234,he took his stand beside the braziers to keep them lit  and looked at all the suitors 
5235,in his heart he formed his plans  which soon would be fulfilled 
5236,athena wanted pain to sink down deep inside odysseus 
5237,she made the suitors keep taunting him 
5238,eurymachus was jeering to make the others laugh 
5239,now listen  suitors  i have an intuition that this man
5240,has come into odysseus house through some god s will 
5241,his head is shining brightly under the lanterns light perhaps because he is completely bald  and then he turned and asked odysseus  the city sacker  stranger  if i was hiring  would you like to labor on a distant farm for me 
5242,you would be paid for sure  if you could plant tall trees  and build stone walls  and i would give you your meals all year and clothes  including footwear 
5243,but you are only skilled at wickedness 
5244,you have no wish to work 
5245,you like to beg  traipsing around to stuff your greedy belly 
5246,crafty odysseus said  how i wish  eurymachus  that we could have a contest in springtime in the meadow  when the days are growing longer  i would have a scythe of perfect curvature and so would you 
5247,the grass would be abundant  we would test our skill by working all day long  not eating
5248,until late evening 
5249,or if we could plow using a pair of fine and well fed oxen  strong and both equal in their power to pull  and if we had four acres of good soil  then you would see if i know how to cut a furrow straight 
5250,or if zeus suddenly made war begin tomorrow  and i had two spears  a shield  and a helmet all of bronze close fitted to my head  you would see me amid the throng of fighters at the front
5251,and you would not hurl insults at my belly 
5252,you act aggressive  and you think you are a big strong man  because you spend your time among this tiny group of lowborn louts 
5253,but if odysseus appeared  the doors which are quite wide would start to seem too narrow  as you were struggling to get away 
5254,scowling with rage  eurymachus replied  you nasty hobo  i will make you pay for showing off in front of all of us 
5255,you should be scared  the wine has made you stupid  or maybe you are always talking nonsense  or you are all puffed up from having won over the beggar irus  then he hurled a footstool at odysseus  who ducked behind amphinomus in fear  it hit the right hand of the slave boy serving wine  the wine jug fell and clattered on the ground 
5256,the boy fell backwards on the dust and moaned 
5257,the suitors shouts resounded through the shadows 
5258,too bad this foreign drifter did not die before he came here causing all this bother  these arguments with beggars are disrupting our banquet  it is spoiling our nice evening 
5259,this silly fuss is dominating things 
5260,telemachus spoke up with dignity 
5261,most noble lords  this is insanity 
5262,perhaps you dined too well  or else some god is stirring you 
5263,now you have finished dinner  go home and sleep  whenever you are ready 
5264,i will not force you out 
5265,they bit their lips  surprised at the self confidence he showed 
5266,amphinomus  the famous son of nisus  grandson of lord aretias  spoke out to all of them 
5267,my friends  what he has said was fair  no one need take offense 
5268,do not abuse the stranger  nor the slaves who work in great odysseus house 
5269,the boy should fill the cups with wine  so we can pour libations  then go home 
5270,telemachus
5271,can take care of the stranger after all  the beggar came to his house 
5272,they agreed 
5273,and moulius  the slave amphinomus had brought there from dulichium  mixed wine for all of them and shared the drinks around 
5274,they poured libations to the gods and sipped the cheering wine 
5275,when they had had enough  each of them went back home  to his own bed 
5276,the queen and the beggar odysseus was left there in the hall  and with athena  he was hatching plans for how to kill the suitors 
5277,words flew fast  telemachus  we have to get the weapons and hide them 
5278,when the suitors see them gone and question you  come up with good excuses 
5279,you can explain  the soot had damaged them  when king odysseus marched off to troy their metal gleamed  now they are growing dull 
5280,i put them safe away from all that smoke 
5281,some spirit also warned me if you drink too much and argue  you could hurt each other  dishonoring your banquet and your courtship 
5282,weapons themselves can tempt a man to fight 
5283,telemachus obeyed his father s word 
5284,he summoned eurycleia  and he told her  shut up the women in their rooms  while i carry my father s weapons to the storeroom 
5285,they have got dirty since my father left when i was just a little boy 
5286,i want
5287,to keep them safe  protected from the smoke 
5288,the loving nurse said  child  i wish you would take charge of all the household management and guard the wealth 
5289,which girl should bring the torch 
5290,you said the slaves were not allowed to walk in front of you 
5291,he said  this stranger will 
5292,a man who eats my bread must work for me  even if he has come from far away 
5293,she made no answer but locked up the doors that led inside the hall 
5294,odysseus
5295,and his bright boy jumped up and got the helmets and studded shields and pointed spears 
5296,athena stood by them with a golden lamp  she made majestic light 
5297,telemachus said  father  my eyes have noticed something very strange 
5298,the palace walls  the handsome fir wood rafters and crossbeams and the pillars high above are visible  as if a fire were lit 
5299,some god from heaven must be in the house 
5300,but cautiously odysseus replied 
5301,hush  no more questions  discipline your thoughts 
5302,this is the way of gods from mount olympus 
5303,you need to go to bed 
5304,i will stay here  to aggravate the slave girls and your mother  and make her cry  and let her question me  telemachus went through the hall  lit up by blazing torches  to his room 
5305,sleep came  and there he lay till dawn 
5306,odysseus stayed in the hall  still plotting with athena how to destroy the suitors 
5307,then the queen 
5308,her wits about her  came down from her room  like artemis or golden aphrodite 
5309,slaves pulled her usual chair beside the fire  it was inlaid with whorls of ivory and silver  crafted by icmalius  who had attached a footstool  all in one 
5310,a great big fleece was laid across the chair  and pensively penelope sat down 
5311,the white armed slave girls came and cleared away the piles of bread  the tables  and the cups 
5312,from which the arrogant suitors had been drinking 
5313,they threw the embers from the braziers onto the floor  and heaped fresh wood inside them for light and warmth 
5314,and then melantho scolded odysseus again 
5315,hey  stranger  will you keep causing trouble  roaming round our house at night and spying on us women here 
5316,get out  you tramp  be happy with your meal  or you will soon get pelted with a torch  be off  odysseus began to scowl 
5317,and made a calculated speech 
5318,insane  you silly girl  why are you mad at me 
5319,because i am all dirty  dressed in rags  and begging through the town 
5320,i have no choice 
5321,that is how homeless people have to live 
5322,i used to have a house  and i was rich  respectable  and often gave to beggars  i helped whoever came  no matter what 
5323,i had a lot of slave girls too  and all the things we count as wealth  the happy life 
5324,zeus ruined it 
5325,he must have wanted to 
5326,girl  may you never lose the rank you have among the other slave girls if your mistress gets angry  or odysseus arrives 
5327,it might still happen 
5328,but if he is dead and never coming back  his son is now a man  praise be apollo 
5329,he will notice any misconduct from the women here 
5330,he is a grown up now 
5331,penelope had listened warily  and now she spoke
5332,to scold the slave 
5333,you brazen  shameless dog  what impudence  i see what you are doing  wipe that impertinent expression off  you knew quite well i told you so myself that i might keep the stranger in the hall to question him about my missing husband 
5334,i am weighed down by grief 
5335,and then she turned to tell eurynome  bring out a chair and put a cushion on it  so this stranger can sit and talk with me  i want to ask him
5336,some questions 
5337,so the woman brought a chair of polished wood  and set a cushion on it 
5338,odysseus knew how to bide his time 
5339,he sat  and circumspect penelope began the conversation 
5340,stranger  first i want to ask what people you have come from 
5341,who are your parents 
5342,where is your home town 
5343,cunning odysseus said  my good woman  no mortal on the earth would speak against you  your glory reaches heaven 
5344,you must be
5345,the daughter of a holy king who ruled a mighty people with good laws  his rule made the black earth grow wheat and barley  trees were full of fruit  the sheep had lambs  the sea provided fish  and people thrived 
5346,this is your house 
5347,you have the right to question me  but do not ask about my family or native land 
5348,the memory will fill my heart with pain 
5349,i am a man of sorrow 
5350,i should not sit in someone else s house
5351,lamenting 
5352,it is rude to keep on grieving 
5353,the slaves  or even you  might criticize and say my tearfulness is caused by wine 
5354,penelope said cautiously  well  stranger  the deathless gods destroyed my strength and beauty the day the greeks went marching off to troy  and my odysseus went off with them 
5355,if he came back and cared for me again  i would regain my beauty and my status 
5356,but now i suffer dreadfully  some god
5357,has ruined me  the lords of all the islands  same  dulichium  and zacynthus  and those who live in ithaca  are courting me though i do not want them to  and spoiling my house 
5358,i cannot deal with suppliants  strangers and homeless men who want a job 
5359,i miss odysseus  my heart is melting 
5360,the suitors want to push me into marriage  but i spin schemes 
5361,some god first prompted me to set my weaving in the hall and work
5362,a long fine cloth 
5363,i said to all my suitors  although odysseus is dead  postpone requests for marriage till i finish weaving this sheet to shroud laertes when he dies 
5364,my work should not be wasted  or the people in argos will reproach me  if a man who won such wealth should lie without a shroud 
5365,they acquiesced 
5366,by day i wove the web  and in the night by torchlight  i unwove it 
5367,i tricked them for three years  long hours went by
5368,and days and months  but then  in the fourth year  with help from my own fickle  doglike slave girls  they came and caught me at it 
5369,then they shouted in protest  and they made me finish it 
5370,i have no more ideas  and i cannot fend off a marriage anymore 
5371,my parents are pressing me to marry  and my son knows that these men are wasting all his wealth and he is sick of it 
5372,he has become quite capable of caring for a house
5373,that zeus has glorified 
5374,and now  you must reveal your ancestry 
5375,you were not born from rocks or trees  as in a fairy tale 
5376,the master of deception answered  wife of great odysseus  laertes son  why will you not stop asking me about my family 
5377,i will speak  if i must 
5378,but you are making all my troubles worse 
5379,it is the way of things  when someone is away from home as long as i have been 
5380,roaming through many cities  many dangers 
5381,still  i will tell you what you ask 
5382,my homeland is crete  a fertile island out at sea 
5383,i cannot count how many people live there  in ninety cities  and our languages are mixed  there are achaeans  native cretans  and long haired dorians and pelasgians 
5384,knossos is there  a mighty city where minos  the intimate of zeus  was king for nine years  and my father was his son 
5385,the brave deucalion  whose other son was idomeneus  who sailed to troy with the two sons of atreus 
5386,my name is aethon  and i am the younger brother 
5387,in crete  i saw odysseus  and gave him guest gifts 
5388,a storm had driven him off course at malea  and carried him to crete  although he yearned for troy 
5389,he narrowly escaped the winds and found a refuge  mooring his ships in amnisus  beside the cave
5390,of eileithyia 
5391,he came up to town  and asked to see my brother  who  he said  was his good friend  a man he much admired 
5392,but idomeneus had sailed to troy ten days before 
5393,i asked him and his crew inside and gave them all a lavish welcome  our stores were ample  and i made the people bring barley and red wine and bulls to butcher  to satisfy their hearts 
5394,those noble greeks stayed for twelve days  a mighty north wind trapped them 
5395,so strong a person could not stand upright  some spirit must have summoned it to curse them 
5396,but on the thirteenth day  the wind died down  they sailed away 
5397,his lies were like the truth  and as she listened  she began to weep 
5398,her face was melting  like the snow that zephyr scatters across the mountain peaks  then eurus thaws it  and as it melts  the rivers swell and flow again 
5399,so were her lovely cheeks dissolved with tears 
5400,she wept for her own husband 
5401,who was right next to her 
5402,odysseus pitied his grieving wife inside his heart  but kept his eyes quite still  without a flicker  like horn or iron  and he hid his tears with artifice 
5403,she cried a long  long time  then spoke again 
5404,now stranger  i would like to set a test  to see if you did host my husband and the men that followed him in your own house  as you have said 
5405,describe his clothes  and what he looked like  and his men 
5406,odysseus the trickster said  my lady  that would be hard to say his visit was so long ago 
5407,it has been twenty years 
5408,but i will tell the image in my mind 
5409,kingly odysseus wore a purple cloak  of double folded wool  held fastened by a golden brooch with double pins  that was elaborately engraved 
5410,in its front paws a dog held down a struggling dappled fawn 
5411,all those who saw it marveled how the dog
5412,could grip the fawn  and how the fawn could kick its legs and try to get away  though both were made of gold 
5413,i noticed his white tunic was soft as dried up onion peel  and shiny as sunlight 
5414,it astonished many women 
5415,but note  i do not know if he had brought these clothes from home  or if a crew member had given them to him on board the ship  or some guest friend 
5416,odysseus had many dear friends  since very few could match his worth 
5417,and i myself gave him a sword of bronze  a double folded purple cloak  and tunic edged with a fringe 
5418,i sent him off in glory when he embarked 
5419,he had a valet with him  i do remember  named eurybates  a man a little older than himself  who had black skin  round shoulders  woolly hair  and was his favorite out of all his crew because his mind matched his 
5420,these words increased her grief 
5421,she knew the signs that he had planted
5422,as evidence  and sobbed  she wept profusely 
5423,pausing  she said  i pitied you before  but now you are a guest and honored friend 
5424,i gave those clothes to him that you describe  i took them from the storeroom  folded them  and clasped that brooch for him 
5425,but i will never welcome him home 
5426,a curse sailed on that ship when he went off to see evilium the town i will not name 
5427,he answered shrewdly  your majesty  odysseus wife 
5428,stop ruining your pretty skin with tears  and grieving for your husband  brokenhearted 
5429,i do not blame you  any woman would mourn for a husband by whom she had children  even if he were not the kind of man they say your husband was a godlike hero 
5430,but stop your crying 
5431,listen 
5432,i will tell you a certainty 
5433,i will be frank with you 
5434,i heard odysseus is coming home 
5435,he is alive and near here  in thesprotia 
5436,by hustling  he gained a heap of treasure that he is bringing home 
5437,he lost his ship at sea  and let his loyal men be killed when he had left thrinacia  helius and zeus despised odysseus  because his men had killed the cattle of the sun 
5438,so all those men were drowned beneath the waves  but he himself was clinging to the rudder and washed up in the land of the phaeacians  the cousins of the gods 
5439,they honored him
5440,as if he were a god himself  and gave him abundant gifts  and tried to send him home safely 
5441,he would have been here long ago  but he decided he should travel more and gather greater wealth 
5442,no man on earth knows better how to make a profit 
5443,pheidon  the king of the thesprotians  told me this 
5444,he poured libations and he swore to me there was a ship already launched and crew all set to take him home 
5445,but pheidon said
5446,good bye to me first  as a ship of theirs happened to be already on its way to barley rich dulichium 
5447,he showed me the treasure that odysseus had gained enough to feed his children and grandchildren for ten whole generations 
5448,pheidon said odysseus had gone to dodona  to ask the rustling oak leaves whether zeus advised him  after all those years away  to go home openly or in disguise 
5449,i tell you  he is safe and near at hand 
5450,he will not long be absent from his home and those that love him 
5451,i swear this by zeus  the highest  greatest god  and by the hearth where i am sheltering 
5452,this will come true as i have said 
5453,this very lunar month  between the waning and the waxing moon odysseus will come 
5454,penelope said warily  well  stranger  i do hope that you are right 
5455,if so  i would reward you
5456,at once with such warm generosity that everyone you met would see your luck 
5457,in fact  it seems to me  odysseus will not come home 
5458,no one will see you off with kind good byes 
5459,there is no master here to welcome visitors as he once did and send them off with honor 
5460,was there ever a man like him 
5461,now slaves  give him a wash and make a bed with mattress  woolen blankets and fresh clean sheets  to keep him warm till dawn
5462,assumes her golden throne 
5463,then bathe and oil him  seat him inside the hall  beside my son  and let him eat 
5464,if any of these men is so corrupt that he would harm our guest  the worse for him  he will get nowhere here  however much he rages 
5465,stranger  how could you have evidence that i excel all other women in intelligence  if you were kept in rags  your skin all sunburnt  in my house 
5466,human beings have short lives 
5467,if we are cruel  everyone will curse us during our life  and mock us when we die 
5468,the names of those who act with nobleness are brought by travelers across the world  and many people speak about their goodness 
5469,but devious odysseus said  wife of great odysseus  i started hating blankets and fine clean sheets the day i rowed from cloudy  mountainous crete 
5470,i will lie down as i have spent so many sleepless nights 
5471,on some rough pallet  waiting for bright dawn 
5472,i do not care for footbaths  do not let any of these slave women in your house come near my feet  unless there is an old one whom i can trust  who has endured the same heartbreak and sorrow as myself 
5473,if so  i would not mind if she should touch my feet 
5474,penelope said thoughtfully  dear guest  how well you speak  no visitor before who came into my house from foreign lands
5475,has ever been so scrupulous 
5476,i have a sensible old woman  who brought up my husband 
5477,she first took him in her arms from his own mother as a newborn child 
5478,she is quite weak  but she can wash your feet 
5479,get up now  eurycleia  wash your master s age mate 
5480,by now  odysseus himself must have old wrinkled feet and hands like these 
5481,we mortals grow old fast in times of trouble 
5482,the old slave she would hot tears  and held her hands
5483,across her face  and wailed  oh  child  i am so useless to you now  zeus hated you beyond all other men  although you are so god fearing  no human ever burned so many thigh bones to the lord of thunder  or sacrificed so much to him 
5484,you prayed that you would reach a comfortable old age and raise your son to be respected 
5485,now you are the only one who cannot reach your home 
5486,and when that poor odysseus
5487,stays at the palaces of foreign kings  i think the women slaves are mocking him as these bad girls are hounding you 
5488,you have refused to let them wash you  to avoid abuse 
5489,but wise penelope has told me to wash you  and reluctantly i will  for her sake and for yours you move my heart 
5490,now listen 
5491,many strangers have come here in trouble and distress 
5492,but i have never seen any man whose body  voice  and feet
5493,are so much like my master s 
5494,he replied shrewdly  old woman  everyone who sees the two of us says we are much alike  you were perceptive to observe the likeness 
5495,then the old woman took the shining cauldron used for a footbath  and she filled it up with water lots of cold  a splash of hot 
5496,odysseus sat there beside the hearth  and hurriedly turned round to face the darkness 
5497,he had a premonition in his heart
5498,that when she touched him  she would feel his scar and all would be revealed 
5499,she kneeled beside him  and washed her master 
5500,suddenly  she felt the scar 
5501,a white tusked boar had wounded him on mount parnassus long ago 
5502,he went there with his maternal cousins and grandfather  noble autolycus  who was the best of all mankind at telling lies and stealing 
5503,hermes gave him this talent to reward him for burning many offerings to him 
5504,much earlier  autolycus had gone to ithaca to see his daughter s baby  and eurycleia put the newborn child on his grandfather s lap and said  now name your grandson this much wanted baby boy 
5505,he told the parents  name him this 
5506,i am disliked by many  all across the world  and i dislike them back 
5507,so name the child odysseus 
5508,and when he is a man  let him come to his mother s people s house 
5509,by mount parnassus 
5510,i will give him treasure and send him home rejoicing 
5511,when he grew  odysseus came there to claim his gifts 
5512,his cousins and autolycus embraced him  and greeted him with friendly words of welcome 
5513,his grandma  amphithea  wrapped her arms around him like a vine and kissed his face and shining eyes 
5514,autolycus instructed his sons to make the dinner 
5515,they obeyed and brought a bull of five years old and flayed it 
5516,and chopped it all in pieces  and then sliced the meat with skill and portioned it on skewers and roasted it with care  and shared it out  and everybody got the same amount 
5517,the whole day long they feasted  till the sun went down and darkness fell 
5518,then they lay down and took the gift of sleep 
5519,when early dawn  the newborn child with rosy hands  appeared  autolycus went hunting with his dogs and with his sons  odysseus went too 
5520,up the steep wooded side of mount parnassus they climbed and reached its windswept folds 
5521,the sun rose from the calmly flowing depths of ocean to touch the fields  just as the hunters came into a glen 
5522,the dogs had dashed in front  looking for tracks 
5523,autolycus sons came after  with odysseus who kept close to the dogs  and brandished his long spear 
5524,a mighty boar lurked there  its lair was thick  protected from the wind  the golden sun
5525,could never strike at it with shining rays  and rain could not get in  there was a pile of fallen leaves inside 
5526,the boar had heard the sound of feet the men and dogs were near 
5527,out of his hiding place he leapt to face them  his bristles standing up  his eyes like fire  and stood right next to them 
5528,odysseus was first to rush at him  his long spear gripped tight in his hand 
5529,he tried to strike  the boar struck first  above his knee  and charging sideways
5530,scooped a great hunk of flesh off with his tusk  but did not reach the bone 
5531,odysseus wounded the boar s right shoulder  and the spear pierced through 
5532,the creature howled and fell to earth 
5533,his life flew out 
5534,autolycus sons bustled around and skillfully bound up the wound received by great odysseus  and stopped the black blood with a charm  and took him back to their father s house  and nursed him well  then gave him splendid gifts  and promptly sent him
5535,back home to ithaca  and he was glad 
5536,his parents welcomed him and asked him questions  wanting to know how he had got the wound 
5537,he told them he was hunting with his cousins on mount parnassus  and a boar attacked him  the white tusk pierced his leg 
5538,the old slave woman  holding his leg and rubbing with flat palms  came to that place  and recognized the scar 
5539,she let his leg fall down into the basin 
5540,it clattered  tilted over  and the water
5541,spilled out across the floor 
5542,both joy and grief took hold of her 
5543,her eyes were filled with tears  her voice was choked 
5544,she touched his beard and said  you are odysseus  my darling child  my master  i did not know it was you until i touched you all around your leg 
5545,she glanced towards penelope  to tell her it was her husband 
5546,but penelope did not look back  she could not meet her eyes  because athena turned her mind aside 
5547,odysseus grabbed her throat with his right hand and with the left  he pulled her close and whispered  nanny  why are you trying to destroy me 
5548,you fed me at your breast  now after all my twenty years of pain  i have arrived back to my home 
5549,you have found out  a god has put the knowledge in your mind 
5550,be silent  no one must know  or else i promise you  if some god helps me bring the suitors down  i will not spare you when i kill the rest 
5551,the other slave women  although you were my nurse 
5552,with calculation  eurycleia answered  my child  what have you said  you know my mind is firm  unshakable  i will remain as strong as stone or iron 
5553,let me promise you this  if you defeat the suitors  i will tell you which women in the palace dishonor you  and which are free from guilt 
5554,odysseus already had a plan 
5555,nanny  why do you mention them 
5556,no need 
5557,i will myself make my own observations of each of them 
5558,be quiet now  entrust the future to the gods 
5559,the old nurse went to fetch more washing water  all the rest was spilt 
5560,she washed and oiled him  and then he pulled his chair beside the fire again  to warm himself  and covered up his scar with rags 
5561,and carefully penelope spoke to him 
5562,stranger  i have one small question i want to ask you 
5563,it will soon be time
5564,to lie down comfortably at least for those who can enjoy sweet sleep  no matter what 
5565,but i have been afflicted by some god with pain beyond all measure 
5566,in the day  i concentrate on my work and my women s  despite my constant grief 
5567,but when night comes  and everybody goes to sleep  i lie crying in bed and overwhelmed by pain  worries and sorrows crowd into my heart 
5568,as when the daughter of pandareus 
5569,the pale gray nightingale  sings beautifully when spring has come  and sits among the leaves that crowd the trees  and warbles up and down a symphony of sound  in mourning for her son by zethus  darling itylus  whom she herself had killed in ignorance  with bronze 
5570,just so  my mind pulls two directions should i stay here beside my son  and keep things all the same my property  my slave girls  and my great house to show respect towards
5571,my husband s bed and what the people say 
5572,or should i marry one of them whichever is best of all the suitors and can bring most presents 
5573,when my son was immature  and young  i could not leave my husband s house 
5574,he would not let me  now that he is big and all grown up  he urges me to go  he is concerned that they are eating up his property 
5575,now how do you interpret this dream of mine 
5576,i dreamed that twenty geese
5577,came from the river to my house  and they were eating grain and i was glad to see them 
5578,then a huge eagle with a pointed beak swooped from the mountain  broke their necks  and killed them 
5579,i wept and wailed  inside the dream  the women gathered around me  and i cried because the eagle killed my geese 
5580,then he came back and sitting on the jutting roof beam  spoke in human language  to restrain my grief 
5581,penelope  great queen  cheer up 
5582,this is
5583,no dream  it will come true 
5584,it is a vision 
5585,the geese are suitors  i was once an eagle  but now i am your husband 
5586,i have come back home to put a cruel end to them 
5587,then i woke up  looked round  and saw the geese still eating grain beside the trough as they had done before 
5588,odysseus  well known for his intelligence  said  my dear woman  there is no way to wrest another meaning out of the dream  odysseus himself
5589,said how he will fulfill it  it means ruin for all the suitors 
5590,no one can protect them from death 
5591,but shrewd penelope said  stranger  dreams are confusing  and not all come true 
5592,there are two gates of dreams  one pair is made of horn and one of ivory 
5593,the dreams from ivory are full of trickery  their stories turn out false 
5594,the ones that come through polished horn come true 
5595,but my strange dream did not come out that way  i think 
5596,i wish
5597,it had  as does my son 
5598,the day of doom is coming that will take me from the house of my odysseus 
5599,i will arrange a contest with his axes 
5600,he would set them all in a row  like ship s props 
5601,from a distance he shot an arrow through all twelve of them 
5602,i will assign this contest to the suitors 
5603,whoever strings his bow most readily  and shoots through all twelve axes  will win me  and i will follow him 
5604,i will be parted
5605,from here  this lovely house  my marriage home  so full of wealth and life  which i suppose i will remember even in my dreams 
5606,scheming odysseus said  honored wife of great odysseus  do not postpone this contest 
5607,they will fumble with the bow and will not finish stringing it or shooting the arrow through  before odysseus  the mastermind  arrives 
5608,she chose her words with care  if you would sit and entertain me 
5609,guest  i would never wish to go to sleep 
5610,but humans cannot stay awake forever  immortal gods have set a proper time for everything that mortals do on earth 
5611,i will go up and lie down on my bed  which is a bed of grief  all stained with tears that i have cried since he went off to see evilium  the town i will not name 
5612,i will lie there  and you lie in this house  spread blankets on the floor  or have the slaves
5613,make up a bed 
5614,with that  she went upstairs  accompanied by slave girls 
5615,in her room  she cried for her dear husband  till sharp sighted athena poured sweet sleep onto her eyes 
5616,the last banquet odysseus was lying at the entrance on an untreated oxhide  over which he heaped a pile of fleeces from the sheep the suitors sacrificed 
5617,eurynome spread a thick blanket over him 
5618,he lay there but did not sleep  his mind was plotting how to kill the suitors 
5619,then the girls who had been sleeping with suitors slipped outside  giggling and happy to be out together 
5620,his heart was roused to rage  he wondered whether
5621,to jump at them and slaughter every one  or let them have one very final night with those proud suitors and his heart was barking  just as a mother dog will stand astride her little puppies  bristling to fight  if she sees any man she does not know  so his heart growled inside him  he was shocked at their behavior 
5622,he slapped his chest and told himself  be strong  my heart 
5623,you were hounded by worse the day the cyclops ate
5624,your strong companions 
5625,but you kept your nerve  till cunning saved you from the cave  you thought that you would die there 
5626,so his heart held firm and constant  but he writhed around  as when a man rotates a sausage full of fat and blood  the huge fire blazes  and he longs to have the roasting finished 
5627,so he squirmed  this way and that  and wondered how he could attack the shameless suitors  being one against a multitude 
5628,athena came
5629,from heaven and stood near him  at his head  resembling a woman  and she said  why are you wide awake  unlucky man 
5630,this is your house  this is your wife inside  and your own child  the son you hoped to have 
5631,clever odysseus said  goddess  yes  all that is true 
5632,but i am wondering how i can attack those upstarts  who are always clustered together  while i am alone 
5633,my biggest fear is this  if you and zeus
5634,help me to kill them  then what 
5635,where can i run to escape my punishment 
5636,you tell me  with glinting eyes athena said  so stubborn  most men trust friends even weaker  mortal friends  whose judgment is far worse than mine 
5637,i am a goddess  and throughout your many trials  i have watched over you 
5638,if we were ambushed  surrounded by not one but fifty gangs of men who hoped to murder us you would escape  and even poach their sheep and cows 
5639,now go to sleep 
5640,to stay on guard awake all night is tiring 
5641,quite soon you will distance yourself  odysseus  from trouble 
5642,with that  the goddess drenched his eyes with sleep  then flew back to olympus 
5643,sleep took hold  relaxed him  and released him from his worries 
5644,meanwhile  his faithful wife was wide awake  crying and sitting upright on her bed against soft pillows 
5645,when her sobs subsided  she prayed 
5646,o artemis  majestic goddess 
5647,daughter of zeus  if only you would shoot an arrow in my heart and kill me now  or let a gust of wind take hold of me and carry me across the misty clouds and fling me where the waters of the ocean pour forth and back again  as when the breezes took up the daughters of pandareus  after the gods destroyed their parents  leaving the daughters orphaned 
5648,aphrodite helped them  and gave them honey  cheese  and mellow wine 
5649,and hera gave them beauty and good sense  above all other women  artemis increased their height  athena taught them how to be most skillful in all handiwork 
5650,then aphrodite went to mount olympus to ask zeus  thunderlord  to grant the girls good marriages he knows all things  all fates  both good and bad 
5651,but harpies seized and forced them to serve the cruel furies 
5652,may the gods annihilate me just like them  or may
5653,artemis strike me dead  with my gaze fixed upon odysseus  let me not make a lesser husband glad 
5654,when someone weeps all through the day quite overwhelmed by grief  but sleeps at night  forgetting everything  her pain is bearable 
5655,but i am cursed with nightmares by some god 
5656,last night  a man was sleeping by me  just like him when he marched off to war 
5657,my heart was cheered  it seemed a vision  not a dream 
5658,as she said this 
5659,the golden dawn arrived 
5660,odysseus heard his wife weeping  and became confused  he thought that she was standing by his head  and that she had already recognized him 
5661,he took the cloak and fleece with which he slept  and put them on a chair inside the palace  and took the oxhide outside to the courtyard  then raised his arms and prayed 
5662,o father zeus  o gods  if you have brought me back on purpose across dry land and sea to my own home 
5663,after you made me suffer all that pain  let someone inside speak in words of omen  and zeus  display another sign outside 
5664,zeus  lord of cunning  heard him  and he thundered from bright olympus  high above the clouds  odysseus was happy 
5665,then a woman  a wheat grinder  inside the house nearby  spoke words of omen 
5666,twelve slaves worked the mills to grind the wheat and barley for the king 
5667,the rest had finished and had gone to sleep 
5668,the weakest one was still at work 
5669,she paused her mill  and spoke he heard it as an omen 
5670,zeus  king of gods and humans  you made thunder boom from a cloudless sky a sign for someone 
5671,fulfill a poor slave s prayer  that this will be the last day that the suitors dine in style here in the old king s house 
5672,my knees are sore from this exhausting work of grinding grain for them 
5673,i pray this is their final meal  this sign and zeus thunder made her master
5674,glad  and more certain he would get revenge on those who did him wrong 
5675,the other women gathered and lit a fire in the hearth 
5676,godlike telemachus got out of bed and dressed  and slung his sword across his back 
5677,he tied his sandals on his well oiled feet  and took his sharp and sturdy bronze tipped spear 
5678,standing across the threshold  he called out to eurycleia 
5679,nanny  did you women make sure our guest was honored  with a meal
5680,and comfortable bed 
5681,or did he lie there neglected 
5682,this is typical of mother  she may be clever  but she acts on whims  she treats unwanted guests with great respect  and rudely sends the better ones away 
5683,the nurse said tactfully  child  do not blame her  not now 
5684,he drank some wine  and chose a chair 
5685,he said he had already had his dinner she asked him 
5686,and at bedtime  she brought out a cot  so that the girls could make his bed 
5687,poor destitute old man  he would not take nice bedding 
5688,he slept outside on the porch  on oxhide and a fleece  we spread a cloak on top of him 
5689,telemachus marched off out of the palace  with his sword in hand  accompanied by two swift dogs  and went down to the meeting place of the achaeans 
5690,then noble eurycleia  child of ops  called to the slaves 
5691,now hurry  you girls sweep the floors and sprinkle them 
5692,spread purple cloths
5693,across the chairs 
5694,you others  sponge the tables  and wash the double handled cups and bowls 
5695,and you  go fetch the water from the spring 
5696,be quick  they will be coming soon  it is a festival for all of them today 
5697,they listened carefully and followed orders 
5698,twenty ran off to fetch the dark spring water  the other well trained slaves were working hard
5699,around the house 
5700,the able bodied men came in and chopped the wood 
5701,they knew their work 
5702,the women got back from the spring  and with them the swineherd came with three fat pigs his best 
5703,he penned them in the yard to root around  and kindly asked odysseus  my friend  are they now treating you with more respect  or still abusing you  just as before 
5704,odysseus  the cunning strategist  replied  eumaeus  may the gods avenge these upstarts for their wickedness and schemes  the scoundrels have abused me in a house
5705,which is not theirs  they show no shame  while they were talking in this way  melanthius arrived with two more herders 
5706,they were driving the very fattest she goats from the flock a contribution to the suitors banquet 
5707,he tied the goats up on the portico  and started picking on odysseus 
5708,stranger  are you still here  still causing trouble  with begging and annoying those inside 
5709,i promise you a beating if you stay 
5710,your begging is not welcome  this is not the only place in greece where there is food 
5711,inscrutable odysseus said nothing  he bowed his head in silence  contemplating his murderous plans 
5712,the third and final herdsman  philoetius  an overseer  came herding fat he goats and an uncalved heifer  brought by a ferryman to ithaca the ferries also carry passengers when anybody needs to get across 
5713,philoetius tied up his animals outside  and asked the swineherd  who is this new guest who has arrived 
5714,who are his people 
5715,where is his native land 
5716,his ancestry 
5717,poor man  he has a kingly look  his bearing is like a lord s 
5718,when gods spin threads of pain  even great kings are made to wander far and suffer greatly 
5719,then he shook his hand and greeted him 
5720,good morning  sir  you are down on your luck  i hope things change for you 
5721,no god is more destructive  zeus  than you  you are the father of humanity  but you do not take pity on our pain 
5722,my eyes are wet  my skin is damp with sweat  as i think of odysseus 
5723,if he still lives and sees the sun  he must be lost  and dressed in rags like these 
5724,or if he has already died  oh  lord odysseus  i am so sorry  he entrusted me with my first herd when i was just a boy 
5725,in cephallenia 
5726,his cattle now are countless  they would not have multiplied so well for someone else 
5727,but now these men are telling me to drive the cows to them for food 
5728,they do not care about the boy  or tremble at the eyes of watchful gods 
5729,my master has been gone a long time now 
5730,they want to share his wealth among themselves  and i keep turning over in my mind that it would not be right to take the cows
5731,and go to foreign lands  when master s son is here 
5732,but it is worse to sit and suffer  just taking care of other people s cattle 
5733,i would have run away and gone to serve another king  things are unbearable 
5734,but i keep hoping my unlucky master will come back from wherever he may be and scatter all these suitors in his halls 
5735,crafty odysseus replied  i see you are intelligent 
5736,so i will swear
5737,a solemn oath to you 
5738,i vow by zeus  and hospitality  and by this hearth  that while you are still here  odysseus will come back home  and if you want  you can watch as the boys who swagger here are killed 
5739,the cowherd answered  stranger  may zeus make your words come true and you would see my strength  and how prepared my hands would be to fight 
5740,eumaeus also prayed to all the gods to bring his many minded master home 
5741,as they were talking in this way  the suitors were planning how to kill telemachus 
5742,but then an eagle flew high on their left  holding a wild dove 
5743,amphinomus said to them  friends  this plan of ours  this murder  will fail 
5744,so let us think about our banquet 
5745,they all agreed  and went inside the house of godlike king odysseus 
5746,they spread cloths on the chairs and sofas  and they killed large sheep  fat goats  big pigs  and one tame cow 
5747,they cooked the innards and divided them  and mixed the wine in bowls  the swineherd poured it into the cups 
5748,philoetius served bread in baskets  and melanthius passed round the wine 
5749,they helped themselves to all the food 
5750,then thinking carefully  telemachus seated odysseus inside the hall  beside the stony threshold  and he brought a table and a stool 
5751,he served him meat and poured a gold cup full of wine  and said 
5752,now you are sitting here and drinking wine among them 
5753,i will stop them touching you or mocking you 
5754,this is no public house  odysseus acquired it for me  and you there  suitors  please  no blows or insults 
5755,we do not want to start an argument 
5756,they bit their lips  surprised to hear the boy speaking so boldly  and antinous  eupeithes son  declared  my lords  we must accept the threats telemachus has made 
5757,annoying though they are 
5758,zeus would not let us kill him or else by now we could have stopped his speechifying in our banquet hall 
5759,telemachus ignored him  and meanwhile  the house boys drove one hundred animals through town for sacrifice 
5760,the ithacans assembled at apollo s shady grove the lord of archery 
5761,inside the house  the suitors cooked the meat kebabs  took out the skewers  then divided up the portions
5762,a splendid feast 
5763,they served odysseus an equal portion with their own  his son  telemachus  had ordered them to do so 
5764,but still athena would not let the suitors refrain from hurtful insults and abuse  so even deeper bitterness would sink into the heart of great odysseus 
5765,one lawless man from same named ctesippus  encouraged by extraordinary wealth  had come to court odysseus wife
5766,because he had been absent for so long 
5767,he shouted to the other reckless suitors  listen  this stranger got an equal share  as is appropriate 
5768,it would  of course  be wrong to disrespect a guest who comes to visit our telemachus 
5769,let me give him a welcome gift  so he can give gifts to the bath attendant or some other house slave here in the palace 
5770,then he grabbed an ox foot from the basket  and he hurled it
5771,towards odysseus  who smoothly ducked  bowing his head  and smiled in scornful rage 
5772,the ox foot struck the wall 
5773,telemachus scolded ctesippus 
5774,you were very lucky you failed to hit the stranger  he avoided the blow himself 
5775,i would have thrust my sword right through your belly  and your father would have held your funeral  and not your wedding 
5776,so from now on  you all should stay in check  here in my house 
5777,i used to be a child 
5778,but now i understand things  good and bad 
5779,i have to watch and put up with all this  the slaughtered sheep  the food  the wine 
5780,it is hard for a single man to put a stop to such a multitude 
5781,but please back down from your hostility to me  or if you do still want to kill me with bronze swords  go on  i want you to 
5782,it would be better to die  than have to watch you suitors acting so horribly abusing strangers  dragging
5783,the house girls through my home  molesting them 
5784,they all fell silent 
5785,agelaus spoke 
5786,my friends  his words are fair 
5787,do not get angry or argue back with him 
5788,do not abuse the stranger  or odysseus slaves 
5789,telemachus  i offer some advice to you and to your mother  with respect 
5790,i hope you can accept it 
5791,while you thought your many minded father would come home  there was no harm in holding us at bay 
5792,and waiting  in case he came back again 
5793,now it is obvious he will not come 
5794,so boy  sit by your mother  and advise her to choose the best  most generous of us to marry  then you can enjoy the wealth left by your father  eat and drink  and she can go take care of someone else s house 
5795,telemachus inhaled  then answered  yes  by zeus and by my father s sufferings lost far from ithaca  or maybe dead
5796,i will because no delay  and i will tell her to pick a husband  and i will provide a lavish dowry 
5797,but i am reluctant to force her if she does not want to go 
5798,may no god make that happen  so he spoke 
5799,athena turned the suitors minds  they laughed unstoppably 
5800,they cackled  and they lost control of their own faces 
5801,plates of meat began to drip with blood 
5802,their eyes were full of tears  and they began to wail in grief 
5803,the prophet theoclymenus addressed them 
5804,what awful thing is happening to you 
5805,your faces  heads  and bodies are wrapped up in night  your screams are blazing out like fire 
5806,the ornate palace ceilings and the walls are spattered with your blood 
5807,the porch is full of ghosts  as is the courtyard ghosts descending into the dark of erebus 
5808,the sun has vanished from the sky  and gloomy mist is all around 
5809,at these words  they all laughed 
5810,eurymachus spoke up 
5811,this new arrival has lost his mind  quick  fellows  throw him out  make him go to the marketplace he thinks it is like night in here  the prophet answered  eurymachus  i will not ask for guides 
5812,i have good eyes and ears and feet  my mind is working perfectly  and i am leaving 
5813,i sense some evil coming for you all  who sit here in odysseus house tormenting and oppressing other people 
5814,not one of you will get away 
5815,with that  he left the palace and went down to meet piraeus  and was welcomed there 
5816,the suitors  with glances at each other  tried to tease telemachus by laughing at his guests 
5817,what awful luck you have with visitors  here is this dirty beggar  always wanting more food and wine  who is unskilled in farmwork or fighting a mere burden on the earth  that other one just stood there prophesying 
5818,now listen i propose a better plan 
5819,pack up your strangers on a boat as slaves  send them to sicily  and make a profit  telemachus ignored the suitors words  and watched his father quietly  still waiting for when they should attack the shameless suitors 
5820,the beautiful penelope had wisely set up her chair to face them  and she listened to what each man was saying 
5821,they had killed numerous animals  and made their banquet
5822,with laughter 
5823,but no dinnertime could be less welcome than the one the mighty man and goddess would soon bring them  in revenge  because they started it and wronged him first 
5824,an archery contest with glinting eyes  athena put a thought into the mind of wise penelope  the daughter of icarius  to place the bow and iron axes in the hall of great odysseus  and set the contest which would begin the slaughter 
5825,she went up to her own room 
5826,her muscular  firm hand picked up the ivory handle of the key a hook of bronze 
5827,then with her slaves she walked down to the storeroom where the master kept
5828,his treasure  gold and bronze and well wrought iron 
5829,the curving bow and deadly arrows lay there  given by iphitus  eurytus son  the godlike man he happened to befriend at wise ortilochus house  far off in lacedaemon  in messenia 
5830,odysseus had gone to claim a debt some people of messenia had come in rowing boats and poached three hundred sheep from ithaca  they took their shepherds too 
5831,laertes and the other older men had sent odysseus to fetch them back when he was still a boy 
5832,and iphitus had come there for his horses  twelve fine mares  each suckling a sturdy mule 
5833,these horses would later because his death  when he had gone to visit heracles  who welcomed him  but killed him  so that he could take the horses betraying hospitality  and heedless about the watchful gods 
5834,before all that 
5835,when iphitus first met odysseus  he gave this bow to him  inherited from his own father 
5836,and odysseus gave iphitus a sword and spear  to mark their bond 
5837,but iphitus was dead before the friends could visit one another s houses 
5838,so when odysseus black fleet sailed to war  he did not take the bow  but stored it in his own house  to use in ithaca in memory of his friend 
5839,the queen had reached
5840,the storeroom  and she stepped across the threshold of polished oak  a skillful carpenter had set it level  fixed the frame  and built the dazzling double doors 
5841,she quickly loosed the door thong from its hook  pushed in the key and with true aim  thrust back the fastenings 
5842,the fine doors  as the key struck home  began to bellow as a bull at pasture bellows 
5843,at once  they flew apart 
5844,she stepped inside  onto the pallet where the scented clothes
5845,were stored in chests  and reached to lift the bow down from its hook  still in its shining case 
5846,she sat down on the floor to take it out  resting it on her lap  and started sobbing and wailing as she saw her husband s bow 
5847,at last  she dried her eyes  and in her arms picked up the curving bow and quiver  packed with many deadly arrows  and she went to meet her arrogant suitors 
5848,slaves lugged out a hamper with their master s many axes
5849,of bronze and iron  for the competition 
5850,the queen came near the suitors  and she stopped beside a pillar with a filmy veil across her face 
5851,two slave girls stood with her 
5852,she said  now listen  lords 
5853,you keep on coming to this house every day  to eat and drink  wasting the wealth of someone who has been away too long 
5854,your motives are no secret 
5855,you want to marry me  i am the prize 
5856,so i will set a contest 
5857,this great bow
5858,belonged to godlike king odysseus 
5859,if anyone can grasp it in his hands and string it easily  and shoot through all twelve axes  i will marry him  and leave this beautiful rich house  so full of life  my lovely bridal home 
5860,i think i will remember it forever  even in my dreams 
5861,she told eumaeus he should set the bow and pale gray iron axes up before the suitors  and in tears the swineherd
5862,took them  and did as she had asked 
5863,the cowherd wept also when he saw his master s bow 
5864,antinous began to scold and taunt them 
5865,he said  you idiots  you tactless peasants  so thoughtless  so undisciplined  you fools  your selfish crying is upsetting her  poor lady  she is sad enough already at losing her beloved husband 
5866,sit and eat in silence  or go do your wailing outside  and leave us suitors here to try
5867,the deadly contest of the bow 
5868,i think it will be difficult  not one of us can match odysseus 
5869,i saw him once in childhood  and i still remember him 
5870,he hoped he would be first to string the bow and shoot through all the axes 
5871,but he would be first to taste an arrow from the hands of great odysseus  whom he had mocked  urging the others on to do the same 
5872,then prince telemachus addressed them all 
5873,zeus must have made me stupid  my dear mother  despite her usual common sense  has said that she will marry someone else and leave this house 
5874,but i am laughing  and my heart feels foolish gladness 
5875,well  come on  you suitors 
5876,you want this prize a woman unlike any in holy pylos  argos or mycenae  or here in ithaca or on the mainland 
5877,no woman in achaea is like her 
5878,there is no need for me to praise my mother 
5879,you know her worth 
5880,so do not make excuses  do not put off the contest of the bow 
5881,we want to watch 
5882,and i will try myself 
5883,if i succeed in stringing it and shooting all through  i will no longer mind if mother goes off with someone else  and leaves me here 
5884,success would prove me man enough to carry my father s arms 
5885,he stood up straight and tall  tossed off his purple cloak  unstrapped his sword  and dug a trench to set the axes up 
5886,all in a line  and trod the earth down flat 
5887,they were amazed to see him work so neatly  though he had never seen it done before 
5888,he stood astride the threshold and began to try the bow 
5889,three times his muscles trembled  straining to draw it back  three times he failed to string the bow and shoot all through the axes 
5890,he would have tried a fourth time  he was keen to keep on pulling 
5891,but odysseus shook his head  stopping him 
5892,telemachus
5893,said  ugh  it seems that i will always be too weak and useless 
5894,or perhaps i am too young and inexperienced at fighting in self defense when someone starts a quarrel 
5895,you all are stronger than i am 
5896,you try  and we can end the contest 
5897,with these words  he set the bow down on the floor  propped up against the polished  jointed double door  and tucked the arrow up against the handle 
5898,he sat back down where he had sat before 
5899,antinous called out  now  friends  get up  from left to right  beginning with the man next to the wine slave  they agreed 
5900,the first was leodes  their holy man  who always sat in the farthest corner  by the wine bowl 
5901,he was the only one who disapproved of all their bullying 
5902,he grasped the bow and stood astride the threshold  and he tried to string it  but he failed 
5903,his hands were soft  untrained by labor  and he grew worn out
5904,trying to pull it back 
5905,he told the suitors  my friends  i cannot do it 
5906,someone else should have a turn 
5907,this bow will take away courage  life force  and energy from many noble young men  but better we should die  than live and lose the goal for which we gather in this house every day 
5908,each man still hopes for marriage with odysseus wife  penelope 
5909,but if one tries and fails to string the bow  let him go use his wealth
5910,to court some other fine  well dressed greek lady 
5911,and after that  penelope will marry whichever man can bring most gifts for her the man whom fate has chosen 
5912,with these words  he set the bow back down  and leaned it up against the polished  jointed double door  tucking the pointed arrow by the handle 
5913,antinous responded with a jeer 
5914,my goodness  leodes  what scary words  all your tough talk has made me really angry 
5915,you cannot string the bow  so you are claiming that it will take the life from proper men 
5916,you surely were not born for archery 
5917,the rest of us are actual warriors  we will soon string this bow 
5918,he told the goatherd  melanthius  come on now  light a fire and pull a chair beside it  with a fleece  and bring out from the pantry a big hunk of fat  so we young men can warm the bow  grease it  and try it  and so end this contest 
5919,melanthius obeyed at once  he lit a blazing fire  and pulled a chair beside it  spreading a fleece on top  and brought the wheel of fat 
5920,the young men warmed the bow  but still they could not string it 
5921,they were far too weak 
5922,antinous and eurymachus  the leaders  strongest and most impressive of the suitors  had still not had their turn 
5923,meanwhile the swineherd and cowherd had both gone outside the house 
5924,odysseus himself came after them 
5925,and when they were outside the gates  beyond the courtyard  in a friendly voice he said  cowherd and swineherd  i am hesitating whether to speak out openly  my impulse is to be frank 
5926,what if some god should guide odysseus  and suddenly  as if from nowhere  he was here how would you act 
5927,would you be with the suitors  or with him 
5928,how are your hearts inclined 
5929,the cowherd said  o father zeus  please make this wish come true 
5930,that he may come  may spirits guide him home  then you would see how well prepared i am to fight for him  eumaeus prayed in turn that all the gods would bring odysseus back home 
5931,the man who thought of everything now knew their minds  and said to them  i am here now 
5932,i suffered terribly for twenty years  and now i have come back to my own land 
5933,i see that you two are the only slaves who welcome my arrival 
5934,i have not
5935,heard any others praying i would come back to my home 
5936,i promise  if some god brings down the noble suitors by my hands  i will give each of you a wife and wealth  and well constructed houses  near my own 
5937,you two will be telemachus brothers 
5938,now let me show you clearer proof  so you can know me well and trust me  see my scar  made by the boar s white tusk  when i had gone to hunt on mount parnassus with my cousins 
5939,so saying  he pulled back his rags and showed the great big scar 
5940,they stared and studied it  then both burst into tears 
5941,they threw their arms around odysseus  and kissed his face and hugged him  overjoyed at seeing him 
5942,odysseus embraced them back and kissed them 
5943,they would have wept till sunset  but he stopped them  and said  stop now  if someone steps outside and sees you crying  they may tell the men 
5944,go in  not both at once but taking turns 
5945,first me  then you  then you 
5946,and this will be our sign  when all the noblemen refuse to let me have the bow and set of arrows  then you must bring them through the hall  eumaeus  and put them in my hands 
5947,command the women to shut up tight the entrance to the hall  and go to their own quarters  if they hear men screaming or loud noises  they must not come out  but stay there quietly  and work 
5948,and you  philoetius  lock up the gates
5949,leading out from the courtyard with the bolt and put the rope on too 
5950,we must move fast 
5951,with that  he went inside  and sat back down on the same chair he sat on earlier 
5952,then the two slaves went in 
5953,eurymachus was handling the bow and warming it  turning it back and forth beside the fire 
5954,but even after that  he could not manage to string it  and he groaned  and yelled in fury  this is disastrous  for all of us 
5955,i do not even mind so much about the marriage 
5956,there are lots of other women on ithaca  and in the other cities 
5957,but that we should be proven so much weaker than king odysseus  that we should fail to string his bow  our deep humiliation will be well known for many years to come  antinous said  no  eurymachus  it will not be like that  as you well know 
5958,no one should shoot a bow today  it is
5959,a feast day for apollo  we should sit calmly and leave the axe heads standing there 
5960,no one will come and take them 
5961,let the boy pour wine  so we can make drink offerings  and leave the bow for now 
5962,at dawn  call back melanthius  to bring the finest goats  so we can make our offerings to the god  apollo  lord of archery  then try the bow again  and finish up the contest 
5963,they all agreed with him 
5964,attendants poured
5965,water to wash their hands  and boys began to mix the wine in bowls  and poured a serving in every cup  so they could make libations and drink 
5966,odysseus  the lord of lies  had carefully considered how to fool them 
5967,he said  now hear me  suitors of the queen  let me reveal the promptings of my heart 
5968,eurymachus and lord antinous  i ask you specially  because you spoke so well  now set the bow aside  and turn
5969,towards the gods 
5970,at dawn  the god will choose the victor and give him success 
5971,for now  give me the polished bow  so i can try my strength and find out if my hands still have the suppleness and vigor of my youth  or if it has been lost in all my years of homelessness and poverty 
5972,they bristled  nervous in case he strung the polished bow 
5973,antinous said  foreigner  you fool  are you not grateful that we let you stay here
5974,and eat with noblemen like us  and share our feast  and hear us talk 
5975,no other beggars can hear our conversation 
5976,this good wine has made you drunk 
5977,it does have that effect on those who gulp and fail to pace themselves 
5978,wine even turned the famous centaur s head 
5979,when eurytion visited the lapiths  inside the house of brave pirithous the wine made him go crazy  and he did terrible things 
5980,the warriors were outraged 
5981,and dragged him from the house 
5982,their ruthless swords cut off his ears and cropped his nose right off 
5983,he wandered  still insane and blown about by gusts of madness 
5984,from that day  the centaurs and humans have been enemies 
5985,his drinking was harmful to himself 
5986,if you should string that bow  it would be worse for you 
5987,no man will treat you kindly in our house 
5988,we will send you by ship to echetus  the king of cruelty  you will find no escape 
5989,sit quietly  drink up  and do not quarrel with younger men 
5990,astute penelope said  no  antinous  it is not right to disrespect a guest telemachus has welcomed to this house 
5991,and do you think that if this stranger s hands were strong enough to string the bow  he would take me away to marry him and live with him 
5992,of course not  he does not even dream of such a thing 
5993,no need to spoil the feast by worrying
5994,about such things  there is no need of that 
5995,eurymachus said  shrewd penelope  it is indeed unlikely that this man would marry you 
5996,but we would feel ashamed if some rude person said  those men are weak  they court a fighter s wife  but cannot string his bow  some random beggar has shown up and strung it easily  and shot right through all of the axes  they will talk like that  and we will be humiliated  calmly 
5997,penelope replied  eurymachus  people who waste the riches of a king have lost their dignity 
5998,why fuss at this 
5999,the stranger is quite tall and muscular  his father must be noble 
6000,go on  give him the bow  and let us watch 
6001,i tell you  if he strings it by the blessing of apollo  i will give him a proper cloak and tunic  fine clothes and sandals  and a two edged sword and dagger  sharp enough to ward away
6002,both men and dogs  and i will help him go wherever he desires to go 
6003,with quick intake of breath  telemachus replied  no  mother  no one has a better right than i to give the bow to anyone or to refuse it 
6004,no one on this island or out towards the pasturelands of elis  and no man in this house can force my hand  even if i should choose to give the bow to him to take away 
6005,go up and work
6006,with loom and distaff  tell your girls the same 
6007,the bow is work for men  especially me  i am the one with power in this house 
6008,she was amazed  and went back to her room  taking to heart her son s assertive words 
6009,inside her bedroom with her girls  she wept for her dear husband  her odysseus  until clear eyed athena let her sleep 
6010,meanwhile  the swineherd lifted up the bow 
6011,the suitors made an uproar 
6012,dirty pig man 
6013,where are you taking it 
6014,are you insane 
6015,the dogs you raised yourself will eat you up when you are out there with your pigs alone  if we find favor with apollo and the other deathless gods 
6016,he was afraid  because there were so many people shouting inside the hall  and set the bow he carried down on the ground 
6017,telemachus called out  in forceful tones 
6018,no  grandpa  keep on going  keep carrying the bow  you will soon see
6019,you have to choose which master to obey 
6020,though i am younger than you  i am stronger  watch out  or i will chase you to the fields  pelting your back with stones 
6021,i wish i had an equal edge on all those who invaded my home to court my mother and make mischief 
6022,i would soon throw them out and make them pay  at that  the suitors all began to laugh  their anger at telemachus was gone 
6023,eumaeus went across the hall and gave
6024,the bow to competent odysseus 
6025,and then he summoned eurycleia  saying  telemachus gave orders you must lock the doors into the hall and tie them fast 
6026,if any of you women hear a noise of screaming men  stay up there in your quarters  do not come out  keep quiet and keep working 
6027,at that  she held her tongue and locked the doors that led into the feast hall 
6028,philoetius scurried outside to bolt the outer gates
6029,that led into the courtyard 
6030,on the porch lay a fresh knotted cable made of byblos  with that  he tied the gates  rushed in and sat back down  and looked towards odysseus 
6031,the master was already handling the bow and turning it this way and that  to see if worms had eaten at the horn while he was gone 
6032,the suitors told each other  he stares at it as if he were an expert in bows 
6033,he acts the part  perhaps he has
6034,a bow like this at home or plans to make one 
6035,see how this pitiful migrant fingers it  one confident young suitor said  i hope his future luck will match how well he does in stringing it  so he had tricked them all 
6036,after examining the mighty bow carefully  inch by inch as easily as an experienced musician stretches a sheep gut string around a lyre s peg and makes it fast odysseus  with ease 
6037,strung the great bow 
6038,he held it in his right hand and plucked the string  which sang like swallow song  a clear sweet note 
6039,the suitors  horrified  grew pale  and zeus made ominous thunder rumble 
6040,odysseus  who had so long been waiting  was glad to hear the signal from the son of double dealing cronus 
6041,he took up an arrow  which was lying on the table 
6042,the others were all packed up in the quiver  soon to be used 
6043,he laid it on the bridge 
6044,then pulled the notch end and the string together  still sitting in his chair 
6045,with careful aim  he shot 
6046,the weighted tip of bronze flew through each axe head and then out the other side 
6047,he told his son  telemachus  your guest does you a credit 
6048,i hit all the targets and with no effort strung the bow 
6049,i am still strong  despite their jibes about my weakness 
6050,though it is daytime  it is time to feast  and later  we can celebrate with music 
6051,the joyful part of dinner 
6052,with his eyebrows he signaled  and his son strapped on his sword  picked up his spear  and stood beside his chair  next to his father  his bronze weapons flashing 
6053,bloodshed odysseus ripped off his rags 
6054,now naked  he leapt upon the threshold with his bow and quiverfull of arrows  which he tipped out in a rush before his feet  and spoke 
6055,playtime is over 
6056,i will shoot again  towards another mark no man has hit 
6057,apollo  may i manage it  he aimed his deadly arrow at antinous 
6058,the young man sat there  just about to lift his golden goblet  swirling wine around 
6059,ready to drink 
6060,he had no thought of death 
6061,how could he 
6062,who would think a single man  among so many banqueters  would dare to risk dark death  however strong he was 
6063,odysseus aimed at his throat  then shot 
6064,the point pierced all the way through his soft neck 
6065,he flopped down to the side and his cup slipped out of his hand  and then thick streams of blood gushed from his nostrils 
6066,his foot twitched and knocked the table down  food scattered on the ground 
6067,the bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood 
6068,seeing him fall  the suitors  in an uproar  with shouts that filled the hall  jumped up and rushed to search around by all the thick stone walls for shields or swords to grab but there were none 
6069,they angrily rebuked odysseus 
6070,stranger  you shot a man  and you will pay  you will join no more games you have to die  for certain  you have killed the best young man in all of ithaca 
6071,right here  the vultures
6072,will eat your corpse 
6073,those poor fools did not know that he had killed antinous on purpose  nor that the snares of death were round them all 
6074,clever odysseus scowled back and sneered  dogs  so you thought i would not come back home from troy 
6075,and so you fleeced my house  and raped my slave girls  and you flirted with my wife while i am still alive  you did not fear the gods who live in heaven  and you thought no man would ever come to take revenge 
6076,now you are trapped inside the snares of death 
6077,at that  pale fear seized all of them 
6078,they groped to find a way to save their lives somehow 
6079,only eurymachus found words to answer 
6080,if it is you  odysseus  come back  then we agree  quite right  the greeks have done outrageous things to your estate and home 
6081,but now the one responsible is dead antinous  it was all his idea 
6082,he did not even really want your wife 
6083,but had another plan  which zeus has foiled  to lie in ambush for your son  and kill him  then seize the throne and rule in ithaca 
6084,now he is slain quite rightly 
6085,please  my lord  have mercy on your people  we will pay in public  yes  for all the food and drink 
6086,we each will bring the price of twenty oxen  and pay you all the gold and bronze you want 
6087,your anger is quite understandable 
6088,odysseus saw through him  with a glare
6089,he told him  even if you give me all your whole inheritance  and even more  i will not keep my hands away from slaughter until i pay you suitors back for all your wickedness 
6090,you have two choices  fight  or run away  just try to save your lives  not one of you will get away from death 
6091,at that their knees grew weak  their hearts stopped still 
6092,eurymachus again addressed the suitors 
6093,my friends  this man will not hold back his hands 
6094,seizing the bow and arrows  he will shoot us right from that polished threshold  till he kills each one of us 
6095,be quick  make plans for battle 
6096,draw out your swords  use tables as your shields against the deadly arrows 
6097,all together  rush at him  try to drive him off the threshold  and out of doors  then run all through the town  and quickly call for help 
6098,this man will soon have shot his last  he drew his sharp bronze sword and with a dreadful scream he leapt at him 
6099,but that same instant  lord odysseus let fly and hit his chest  beside the nipple  and instantly the arrow pierced his liver 
6100,the sword fell from his hand 
6101,he doubled up and fell across the table  spilling food and wine across the floor 
6102,he smashed his head against the ground  and in his desperate pain kicked up the chair  and darkness drenched his eyes 
6103,amphinomus attacked odysseus 
6104,he drew his sharp sword  hoping he could force him
6105,to yield his place 
6106,telemachus leapt in and thrust his bronze spear through him from behind  ramming it through his back and out his chest 
6107,face first he crashed and thudded to the ground 
6108,telemachus dashed back he left his spear stuck in the body  he was terrified that if he bent to pull it out  some greek would jump on him and stab him with a sword 
6109,he ran and quickly reached his loyal father 
6110,he stood beside him and his words flew out 
6111,now father  i will fetch a shield for you and two spears and a helmet made of bronze  and i will arm myself  and bring more arms for our two herdsmen  since we all need weapons 
6112,odysseus  the master planner  answered  run fast while i still have a stock of arrows  before they force me from the doors i am fighting alone up here 
6113,his son obeyed 
6114,he hurried to the storeroom for the arms  and took eight spears  four shields  and four bronze helmets
6115,each fitted out with bushy horsehair plumes 
6116,he hurried back to take them to his father  and was the first to strap the armor on 
6117,the two slaves also armed themselves  and stood flanking their brilliant  resourceful leader 
6118,as long as he had arrows  he kept shooting  and one by one he picked the suitors off  inside his own home 
6119,then at last the king ran out of arrows  he set down his bow next to the sturdy doorpost  leaning up
6120,against the palace walls  all shining white 
6121,he slung the four fold shield across his shoulders  and put the well made helmet on his head 
6122,the crest of horsehair gave a fearsome nod 
6123,he grasped a bronze tipped spear in either hand 
6124,there was a back gate in the castle walls  providing access to the passageway  with tightly fitted doors 
6125,odysseus ordered the noble swineherd to stand there to guard it there was only one way out 
6126,agelaus called out to all the suitors 
6127,friends  one of us should slip out through that gate and quickly tell the people  raise alarms 
6128,that soon would put a stop to this man s shooting 
6129,melanthius the goatherd answered  no  my lord  that entryway is much too narrow  and dangerously near the palace doors 
6130,one man  if he was brave  could keep it guarded against us all 
6131,so i will bring you armor out of the storeroom  which i think is where
6132,those two  our enemies  have hidden it 
6133,melanthius the goatherd climbed up past the arrow slits inside the castle walls  into the chamber 
6134,there he took twelve shields  twelve spears and twelve bronze helmets  each one crested with horsehair 
6135,then he hurried back downstairs and handed all the weapons to the suitors 
6136,odysseus could see that they had arms  their spears were brandished 
6137,his heart stopped  his legs trembled he was so shocked at their presumption 
6138,at once his words flew out to tell his son  one of the women  or melanthius  is waging war against us  in my house  wisely telemachus owned up at once 
6139,father  it was my fault  i am to blame 
6140,i left the heavy storeroom door ajar 
6141,someone on their side must have kept good watch 
6142,go there  eumaeus  shut the door  and see if any of the women are against us  or else  as i suspect  melanthius 
6143,meanwhile  melanthius was going back to get more weapons from the room 
6144,the swineherd saw him and told odysseus  my lord  that little sneak  the man we all suspected  is going to the stores  odysseus  you always have a plan for what to do  so should i kill him  as i think is best  or bring him here to you  so you can punish his many crimes against you in your house 
6145,odysseus already had a plan 
6146,telemachus and i will keep the suitors trapped in the hall however much they rage 
6147,you two  truss up his hands and feet behind him  drag him inside the storeroom  string him up  tying a knotted rope high on the column  and hoist him to the rafters 
6148,torture him with hours of agony before he dies 
6149,his word was their command  they hurried off  and reached the weaponry 
6150,melanthius was unaware of them 
6151,as he was searching
6152,for arms  they stopped on each side of the door and waited 
6153,when he stepped across the threshold  holding a lovely helmet in one hand  and in the other hand  a rusty shield  once carried by laertes in his youth  but now in storage  with its seams all loose 
6154,the two men jumped on him and grabbed his hair to drag him in and threw him on the floor  shaking with fear 
6155,they bound his hands and feet and yanked them painfully behind his back 
6156,just as the lord of suffering had told them 
6157,they tied him with a knotted rope and hoisted his body up the column to the rafters 
6158,swineherd eumaeus  you began to mock him  keep watch the whole night through  melanthius  tucked up in this soft bed it serves you right  and wait there for the golden throne of dawn leaving the sea  that hour when you would lead your goats to this house for the suitors dinner 
6159,there he was left  bound cruelly and stretched 
6160,the herdsmen armed themselves and left the room  shutting the door  and joined their cunning leader 
6161,they stood there on the threshold  tense with purpose  just four against so many men inside 
6162,the child of zeus  athena  came to meet them  her voice and looks resembled those of mentor 
6163,odysseus was happy when he saw her  and said  remember our old friendship  mentor  i have been good to you since we were boys 
6164,so help me now  he guessed it was athena 
6165,who rouses armies 
6166,from the hall  the suitors shouted their opposition 
6167,agelaus called  mentor  do not let odysseus sway you to help him and to fight against us 
6168,i think this is how things will go 
6169,when we have killed this father and his son  you will die also  if you do as you intend  and pay with your own life for all your plots 
6170,our bronze will strip your life away from you  and we will seize whatever you may own
6171,and mix it with the loot we get from here 
6172,your sons will not survive here in these halls  nor will your wife and daughters still walk free in ithaca 
6173,at that athena s heart became enraged  and angrily she scolded odysseus 
6174,where is your courage now 
6175,you fought nine years on end against the trojans  for white armed helen  zeus favorite child 
6176,you slaughtered many men when war was raging  and formed the plan that made the city fall 
6177,now you are home at last  how can you flinch from being brave and using proper force against these suitors 
6178,come now  stand by me and watch how mentor  son of alcimus  will treat your enemies as recompense for all your service 
6179,but she did not grant decisive victory  she kept on testing odysseus courage  and his son s 
6180,she flew up like a swallow through the smoke and nestled in the rafters of the roof 
6181,now agelaus  demoptolemus  eurynomus  pisander  amphimedon  and polybus were urging on the suitors 
6182,those were the most heroic of the group who still survived and battled for their lives  the others were defeated by the bow and raining arrows 
6183,agelaus told them  that mentor s boasts were empty  friends  he left  and they are all alone there at the entrance 
6184,now force this cruel man to stay his hands 
6185,do not hurl spears at him all in a mass  but you six must shoot first and pray lord zeus we strike odysseus and win the fight 
6186,once he is down  the others will be nothing 
6187,the six men threw their spears as he had said  at once athena made their efforts fail 
6188,one pierced the doorpost of the palace hall  another hit the closely fitted door  another s spear of ash and heavy bronze fell on the wall 
6189,the group of four avoided
6190,all of the suitors spears 
6191,odysseus had waited long enough 
6192,my friends  he said  they want to slaughter us and strip our arms  avenge my former wrongs  and save your lives  now shoot  they hurled their spears at once and hit 
6193,odysseus killed demoptolemus  telemachus  euryades  the swineherd slaughtered elatus  and the cowherd killed pisander 
6194,they all fell and bit the earth 
6195,the other suitors huddled in a corner 
6196,the four rushed up and from the corpses pulled their spears 
6197,again the suitors threw their weapons  again athena made them fail 
6198,one spear struck at the doorpost  and another pierced the door  another ash spear hit the wall 
6199,amphimedon s blow grazed telemachus right by the wrist  the bronze tore through his skin 
6200,ctesippus hurled his spear  it only scratched the swineherd s shoulder  just above his shield  flew past and fell down on the floor behind him 
6201,the competent  sharp eyed odysseus and his companions hurled their piercing spears into the swarming throng 
6202,the city sacker skewered eurydamas  telemachus slashed amphimedon  and the swineherd struck at polybus  the cowherd sliced right through ctesippus chest  and crowed  you fool  you loved insulting us now you have stopped your boasting 
6203,the gods have got the last word  they have won 
6204,this is a gift to pay you for that kick
6205,you gave odysseus when he walked through his own house  as a homeless man in need 
6206,odysseus moved closer with his spear  and pierced agelaus  telemachus thrust at leocritus  and drove his bronze into his belly 
6207,he fell down headfirst  face smashed against the floor 
6208,then from the roof athena lifted high her deadly aegis 
6209,the frightened suitors bolted through the hall like cattle  roused and driven by a gadfly
6210,in springtime  when the days are getting longer 
6211,as vultures with their crooked beaks and talons swoop from the hills and pounce on smaller birds that fly across the fields beneath the clouds  the victims have no help and no way out  as their attackers slaughter them  and men watch and enjoy the violence 
6212,so these four fighters sprang and struck  and drove the suitors in all directions 
6213,screaming filled the hall  as skulls were cracked  the whole floor ran with blood 
6214,leodes darted up to supplicate odysseus  he touched his knees 
6215,please  mercy  i did no wrong  i swear  in word or deed to any of the women in the house 
6216,i tried to stop the suitors  tried to urge them to keep their hands clean  but they would not listen 
6217,those fools deserved their fate 
6218,but i did nothing  i am a priest yet i must lie with them 
6219,will good behavior go unrewarded 
6220,the calculating hero scowled at him 
6221,if  as you claim  you sacrificed for them  you must have often prayed here in my hall that i would not regain the joys of home  and that my wife would marry you instead  and bear you children 
6222,you will not escape 
6223,suffer and die  agelaus had dropped his sword when he was killed 
6224,with his strong arm odysseus swung  slashed down and sliced right through the priest s neck  and his head  still framing words  rolled in the dust 
6225,the poet phemius 
6226,who had been forced to sing to please the suitors  was huddling by the back door with his lyre  anxiously considering his choices  to slip outside and crouch beneath the altar of mighty zeus  the god of home owners  where his old masters burned so many thigh bones  or he could run towards odysseus and grasp him by the knees and beg for mercy 
6227,he made his mind up  he would supplicate 
6228,he set his hollow lyre on the ground
6229,between the mixing bowl and silver chair  and dashed to take odysseus knees  beseeching him in quivering winged words 
6230,i beg you  lord odysseus  have mercy  think  if you kill me now  you will be sorry  i have the power to sing for gods and men 
6231,i am self taught all kinds of song are planted by gods inside my heart 
6232,i am prepared to sing for you  as if before a god 
6233,wait  do not cut my throat  just ask your son 
6234,he will explain it was against my will that i came here to sing to them after dinner 
6235,they were too fierce and they outnumbered me  i had no choice 
6236,then strong telemachus turned quickly to his father  saying  stop  hold up your sword this man is innocent 
6237,and let us also save the house boy  medon 
6238,he always cared for me when i was young unless the herdsmen have already killed him  or he already met you in your rage 
6239,medon was sensible  he had been hiding under a chair  beneath a fresh cowhide  in order to escape from being killed 
6240,hearing these words  he jumped up from the chair  took off the cowhide and assumed the pose of supplication near telemachus  and said  friend  here i am  please spare my life  your father is too strong  and furious against the suitors  who skimmed off his wealth and failed to honor you 
6241,please  talk to him 
6242,canny odysseus smiled down and said  you need not worry  he has saved your life 
6243,so live and spread the word that doing good is far superior to wickedness 
6244,now leave the hall and go outside  sit down  joining the famous singer in the courtyard  so i can finish what i have to do inside my house 
6245,the two men went outside  and crouched by zeus altar  on the lookout for death at any moment all around 
6246,odysseus scanned all around his home for any man who might be still alive  who might be hiding to escape destruction 
6247,he saw them fallen  all of them  so many  lying in blood and dust  like fish hauled up out of the dark gray sea in fine mesh nets  tipped out upon the curving beach s sand  they gasp for water from the salty sea 
6248,so lay the suitors  heaped across each other 
6249,odysseus  still scheming  told his son 
6250,i need to say something to eurycleia 
6251,hurry  telemachus  and bring her here 
6252,telemachus was glad to please his father 
6253,he pushed the door ajar and called the nurse 
6254,nanny  come quick  you have been here for years 
6255,you supervise the female palace slaves 
6256,my father has to talk to you  come on  she had no words to answer him  but opened the doors into the great and sturdy hall 
6257,telemachus went first and led the way 
6258,among the corpses of the slaughtered men she saw odysseus all smeared with blood 
6259,after a lion eats a grazing ox  its chest and jowls are thick with blood all over  a dreadful sight 
6260,just so  odysseus had blood all over him from hands to feet 
6261,seeing the corpses  seeing all that blood  so great a deed of violence  she began to crow 
6262,odysseus told her to stop and spoke with fluent words 
6263,old woman  no 
6264,be glad inside your heart  but do not shout 
6265,it is not pious  gloating over men who have been killed 
6266,divine fate took them down  and their own wicked deeds 
6267,they disrespected all people that they met  both bad and good 
6268,through their own crimes they came to this bad end 
6269,but tell me now about the household women 
6270,which ones dishonor me 
6271,and which are pure 
6272,the slave who loved her master answered  child  i will tell you exactly how things stand 
6273,in this house we have fifty female slaves whom we have trained to work  to card the wool  and taught to tolerate their life as slaves 
6274,twelve stepped away from honor  those twelve girls ignore me  and penelope our mistress 
6275,she would not let telemachus instruct them  since he is young and only just grown up 
6276,let me go upstairs to the women s rooms  to tell your wife some god has sent her sleep 
6277,the master strategist odysseus
6278,said  not yet  do not wake her 
6279,call the women who made those treasonous plots while i was gone 
6280,the old nurse did so 
6281,walking through the hall  she called the girls 
6282,meanwhile  odysseus summoned the herdsmen and telemachus and spoke winged words to them 
6283,now we must start to clear the corpses out 
6284,the girls must help 
6285,then clean my stately chairs and handsome tables with sponges fine as honeycomb  and water 
6286,when the whole house is set in proper order 
6287,restore my halls to health  take out the girls between the courtyard wall and the rotunda 
6288,hack at them with long swords  eradicate all life from them 
6289,they will forget the things the suitors made them do with them in secret  through aphrodite 
6290,sobbing desperately the girls came  weeping  clutching at each other 
6291,they carried out the bodies of the dead and piled them up on top of one another  under the roof outside 
6292,odysseus
6293,instructed them and forced them to continue 
6294,and then they cleaned his lovely chairs and tables with wet absorbent sponges  while the prince and herdsmen with their shovels scraped away the mess to make the sturdy floor all clean 
6295,the girls picked up the trash and took it out 
6296,the men created order in the house and set it all to rights  then led the girls outside and trapped them they could not escape between the courtyard wall and the rotunda 
6297,showing initiative  telemachus insisted  i refuse to grant these girls a clean death  since they poured down shame on me and mother  when they lay beside the suitors 
6298,at that  he wound a piece of sailor s rope round the rotunda and round the mighty pillar  stretched up so high no foot could touch the ground 
6299,as doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly home to their nests  but someone sets a trap they crash into a net  a bitter bedtime 
6300,just so the girls  their heads all in a row  were strung up with the noose around their necks to make their death an agony 
6301,they gasped  feet twitching for a while  but not for long 
6302,then the men took melanthius outside and with curved bronze cut off his nose and ears and ripped away his genitals  to feed raw to the dogs 
6303,still full of rage  they chopped his hands and feet off 
6304,then they washed their own  and they went back inside 
6305,odysseus
6306,told his beloved nurse  now bring me fire and sulfur  as a cure for evil things  and i will fumigate the house 
6307,and call penelope  her slaves  and all the slave girls inside the house 
6308,she answered with affection  yes  dear  all this is good 
6309,but let me bring a cloak and shirt for you 
6310,you should not stand here your strong back covered only with those rags 
6311,that would be wrong  odysseus  the master of every cunning scheme  replied  no  first
6312,i need a fire here  to smoke the hall 
6313,his loving slave complied and brought the fire and sulfur  and odysseus made smoke  and fumigated every room inside the house and yard 
6314,meanwhile  the old nurse ran all through the palace summoning the women 
6315,by torchlight they came out from their apartments  to greet odysseus with open arms 
6316,they kissed his face and took him by the hands in welcome 
6317,he was seized by sweet desire
6318,to weep  and in his heart he knew them all 
6319,the olive tree bed chuckling with glee  the old slave climbed upstairs to tell the queen that her beloved husband was home 
6320,her weak old knees felt stronger now  with buoyant steps she went and stood beside her mistress  at her head  and said  dear child  wake up and see  at long last you have got your wish come true  odysseus has come  he is right here inside this house  at last  he slaughtered all the suitors who were wasting his property and threatening his son 
6321,but cautiously penelope replied  you poor old thing  the gods have made you crazy 
6322,they have the power to turn the sanest person mad  or make fools turn wise 
6323,you used to be so sensible  but they have damaged you 
6324,why else would you be mocking me like this  with silly stories  in my time of grief 
6325,why did you wake me from the sleep that sweetly wrapped round my eyes 
6326,i have not slept so soundly since my odysseus marched off to see
6327,that cursed town evilium 
6328,go back  if any other slave comes here to wake me and tell me all this nonsense  i will send her back down at once  and i will not be gentle 
6329,your old age will protect you from worse scolding 
6330,but eurycleia answered with affection  dear child  i am not mocking you 
6331,i am telling the truth  odysseus is here  he is the stranger that they all abused 
6332,telemachus has known for quite some time 
6333,but sensibly he kept his father s plans a secret  so odysseus could take revenge for all their violence and pride 
6334,penelope was overjoyed  she jumped from bed and hugged the nurse  and started crying 
6335,her words flew fast 
6336,dear nanny  if this is the truth  if he has come back to this house  how could he have attacked those shameless suitors  when he is just one man  and there were always so many crowded in there 
6337,eurycleia
6338,answered  i did not see or learn the details 
6339,i heard the sound of screaming from the men as they were killed 
6340,we huddled in our room and kept the doors tight shut  until your son called me his father sent him 
6341,then i saw odysseus surrounded by dead bodies 
6342,they lay on top of one another  sprawled across the solid floor 
6343,you would have been thrilled if you saw him  like a lion  drenched in blood and gore 
6344,now they are all piled up
6345,out by the courtyard gates  and he is burning a mighty fire to fumigate the palace  restoring all its loveliness 
6346,he sent me to fetch you 
6347,come with me  so both of you can start to live in happiness 
6348,you have endured such misery 
6349,your wish came true  he is alive  he has come home again  and found you and your son  and he has taken revenge on all the suitors who abused him 
6350,penelope said carefully  do not
6351,start gloating 
6352,as you know  my son and i would be delighted if he came 
6353,we all would 
6354,however  what you say cannot be true 
6355,some god has killed the suitors out of anger at their abuse of power and their pride 
6356,they failed to show respect to visitors  both good and bad 
6357,their foolishness has killed them 
6358,but my odysseus has lost his home  and far away from greece  he lost his life 
6359,the nurse replied  dear child  how can you say
6360,your husband will not come  when he is here  beside the hearth 
6361,your heart has always been mistrustful 
6362,but i have clear evidence  when i was washing him  i felt the scar made when the boar impaled him with its tusk 
6363,i tried to tell you  but he grabbed my throat and stopped me spoiling all his plans 
6364,come with me  i swear on my own life  if i am lying  then kill me  wise penelope said  nanny  it must be hard for you to understand
6365,the ways of gods  despite your cleverness 
6366,but let us go to meet my son  so i can see the suitors dead  and see the man who killed them 
6367,so she went downstairs 
6368,her heart could not decide if she should keep her distance as she was questioning her own dear husband  or go right up to him and kiss his face and hold his hands in hers 
6369,she crossed the threshold and sat across from him beside the wall  in firelight 
6370,he sat beside the pillar 
6371,and kept his eyes down  waiting to find out whether the woman who once shared his bed would speak to him 
6372,she sat in silence  stunned 
6373,sometimes when she was glancing at his face it seemed like him  but then his dirty clothes were unfamiliar 
6374,telemachus scolded her 
6375,mother  cruel  heartless mother  why are you doing this  rejecting father 
6376,why do you not go over  sit beside him  and talk to him 
6377,no woman in the world
6378,would be so obstinate  to keep your distance from him when he has come back after twenty long years of suffering  your heart is always harder than rock  but thoughtfully she answered  my child  i am confused 
6379,i cannot speak  or meet his eyes 
6380,if this is really him  if my odysseus has come back home  we have our ways to recognize each other  through secret signs known only to us two 
6381,hardened odysseus began to smile 
6382,he told the boy  you must allow your mother to test me out  she will soon know me better 
6383,while i am dirty  dressed in rags  she will not treat me with kindness or acknowledge me  meanwhile  we must make plans 
6384,if someone murders even just one man  even one who had few friends in his community  the killer is forced to run away and leave his homeland and family 
6385,but we have killed the mainstay of ithaca  the island s best young men 
6386,so what do you suggest 
6387,telemachus said warily  you have to work it out 
6388,they say you have the finest mind in all the world  no mortal man can rival you in cleverness 
6389,lead me  and i will be behind you right away 
6390,and i will do my best to be as brave as i can be 
6391,odysseus was quick to form a plan 
6392,he told him  here is what i think is best 
6393,the three of you should wash and change your clothes 
6394,and make the slave girls go put on clean dresses 
6395,then let the godlike singer take the lyre and play a clear and cheerful dancing tune  so passersby or neighbors hearing it will think it is a wedding 
6396,we must not allow the news about the suitors murder to spread too far until we reach the woods of our estate  and there we can decide the best path forward offered us by zeus 
6397,they did as lord odysseus had said 
6398,they washed and changed their tunics  and the slave girls prepared themselves 
6399,the singer took the lyre  and roused in them desire to hear sweet music  and dance 
6400,the house resounded with the thump of beating feet from all the dancing men and girls in pretty sashes 
6401,those outside who heard the noises said to one another  so somebody is marrying the queen who had so many suitors  headstrong woman  she must have lacked the strength to wait it out
6402,and keep her husband s house safe till he came 
6403,they spoke with no idea what really happened 
6404,eurynome the slave woman began to wash strong willed odysseus 
6405,she rubbed him with olive oil  and dressed him in a tunic and handsome cloak 
6406,and then athena poured attractiveness from head to toe  and made him taller and stronger  and his hair grew thick and curly as a hyacinth 
6407,as when a craftsman whom athena or hephaestus
6408,has trained in metalwork  so he can make beautiful artifacts  pours gold on silver so she poured beauty on his head and shoulders 
6409,after his bath he looked like an immortal 
6410,he sat down in the same chair opposite his wife and said  extraordinary woman  the gods have given you the hardest heart 
6411,no other wife would so reject a husband who had been suffering for twenty years and finally come home 
6412,well  nanny  make
6413,a bed for me  so i can rest 
6414,this woman must have an iron heart  penelope said shrewdly  you extraordinary man  i am not acting proud  or underplaying this big event  yet i am not surprised at how you look 
6415,you looked like this the day your long oars sailed away from ithaca 
6416,now  eurycleia  make the bed for him outside the room he built himself 
6417,pull out the bedstead  and spread quilts and blankets on it 
6418,she spoke to test him  and odysseus was furious  and told his loyal wife  woman  your words have cut my heart  who moved my bed 
6419,it would be difficult for even a master craftsman though a god could do it with ease 
6420,no man  however young and strong  could pry it out 
6421,there is a trick to how this bed was made 
6422,i made it  no one else 
6423,inside the court there grew an olive tree with delicate long leaves  full grown and green 
6424,as sturdy as a pillar  and i built the room around it 
6425,i packed stones together  and fixed a roof and fitted doors 
6426,at last i trimmed the olive tree and used my bronze to cut the branches off from root to tip and planed it down and skillfully transformed the trunk into a bedpost 
6427,with a drill  i bored right through it 
6428,this was my first bedpost  and then i made the other three  inlaid with gold and silver and with ivory 
6429,i stretched ox leather straps across  dyed purple 
6430,now i have told the secret trick  the token 
6431,but woman  wife  i do not know if someone a man has cut the olive trunk and moved my bed  or if it is still safe 
6432,at that  her heart and body suddenly relaxed 
6433,she recognized the tokens he had shown her 
6434,she burst out crying and ran straight towards him and threw her arms around him  kissed his face  and said  do not be angry at me now 
6435,odysseus  in every other way you are a very understanding man  the gods have made us suffer  they refused to let us stay together and enjoy our youth until we reached the edge of age together 
6436,please forgive me  do not keep bearing a grudge because when i first saw you  i would not welcome you immediately 
6437,i felt a constant dread that some bad man would fool me with his lies 
6438,there are so many
6439,dishonest  clever men 
6440,that foreigner would never have got helen into bed  if she had known the greeks would march to war and bring her home again 
6441,it was a goddess who made her do it  putting in her heart the passion that first caused my grief as well 
6442,now you have told the story of our bed  the secret that no other mortal knows  except yourself and me  and just one slave  actoris  whom my father gave to me
6443,when i came here  who used to guard our room 
6444,you made my stubborn heart believe in you 
6445,this made him want to cry 
6446,he held his love  his faithful wife  and wept 
6447,as welcome as the land to swimmers  when poseidon wrecks their ship at sea and breaks it with great waves and driving winds  a few escape the sea and reach the shore  their skin all caked with brine 
6448,grateful to be alive  they crawl to land 
6449,so glad she was to see her own dear husband 
6450,and her white arms would not let go his neck 
6451,they would have wept until the rosy dawn began to touch the sky  but shining eyed athena intervened 
6452,she held night back  restraining golden dawn beside the ocean  and would not let her yoke her swift young colts  shining and bright 
6453,odysseus  mind whirling  said  wife  we have not come yet to the end of all our troubles  there are more to come  many hard labors which i must complete 
6454,the spirit of tiresias informed me  that day i went inside the house of hades to ask about the journey home for me and for my men 
6455,but come now  let us go to bed together  wife  let us enjoy the pleasure of sweet sleep 
6456,penelope  who always thought ahead  said  when you wish 
6457,the bed is yours 
6458,the gods have brought you home  back to your well built house 
6459,but since a god has made you speak about these future labors 
6460,tell me what they involve 
6461,i will find out eventually  and better to know now 
6462,he answered warily  you really are extraordinary 
6463,why would you make me tell you something to because you pain 
6464,it hurts me too  but i will tell the truth  not hide it from you 
6465,tiresias foretold that i must travel through many cities carrying an oar  till i reach men who do not know the sea  and do not eat their food with salt  or use
6466,boats painted red around the prow  or oars  which are the wings of ships 
6467,he said that i will know i have arrived when i encounter someone who calls the object on my back a winnowing fan 
6468,then i must fix my oar firm in the earth  and make a sacrifice to lord poseidon  of a ram and ox and stud boar  perfect animals  then come back home and give a hecatomb to all the deathless gods who live above the sky 
6469,if i do this  i will not die at sea  i will grow old in comfort and will meet a gentle death  surrounded by my people  who will be rich and happy 
6470,sensibly penelope said  if the gods allow you to reach old age in comfort  there is hope that there will be an end to all our troubles 
6471,they talked like this 
6472,meanwhile  the slaves were working  eurynome and eurycleia laid soft blankets on the sturdy bed by torchlight 
6473,the nurse went off to sleep  and eurynome picked up the torch and led them to their bed  then went to her room 
6474,finally  at last  with joy the husband and the wife arrived back in the rites of their old marriage bed 
6475,meanwhile  the herdsmen and telemachus stopped dancing  made the women stop  and went to bed inside the darkened house 
6476,and when the couple had enjoyed their lovemaking  they shared another pleasure telling stories 
6477,she told him how she suffered as she watched the crowd of suitors ruining the house  killing so many herds of sheep and cattle and drinking so much wine  because of her 
6478,odysseus told her how much he hurt so many other people  and in turn how much he had endured himself 
6479,she loved to listen  and she did not fall asleep until he told it all 
6480,first  how he slaughtered the cicones  then traveled to the fields
6481,of lotus eaters  what the cyclops did  and how he paid him back for ruthlessly eating his men 
6482,then how he reached aeolus  who welcomed him and helped him  but it was not yet his fate to come back home  a storm snatched him and bore him off across the sea  howling frustration 
6483,then  he said  he came to laestrygonia  whose people wrecked his fleet and killed his men 
6484,and he described the cleverness of circe  and his journey
6485,to hades to consult tiresias  and how he saw all his dead friends  and saw his mother  who had loved him as a baby  then how he heard the sirens endless voices  and reached the wandering rocks and terrible charybdis  and how he had been the first to get away from scylla 
6486,and he told her of how his crew devoured the sun god s cattle  zeus roared with smoke and thunder  lightning struck the ship  and all his loyal men were killed 
6487,but he survived  and drifted to ogygia 
6488,he told her how calypso trapped him there  inside her hollow cave  and wanted him to be her husband  she took care of him and promised she could set him free from death and time forever 
6489,but she never swayed his heart 
6490,he suffered terribly  for years  and then he reached phaeacia  where the people looked up to him as if he were a god  and sent him in a ship back home again
6491,to his dear ithaca  with gifts of bronze and gold and piles of clothes 
6492,his story ended  sweet sleep released his heart from all his cares 
6493,athena  bright eyed goddess  stayed alert  and when she thought odysseus had finished with taking pleasure in his wife and sleep  she roused the newborn dawn from ocean s streams to bring the golden light to those on earth 
6494,odysseus got up and told his wife  wife  we have both endured our share of trouble 
6495,you wept here as you longed for my return  while zeus and other gods were keeping me away from home  although i longed to come 
6496,but now we have returned to our own bed  as we both longed to do 
6497,you must look after my property inside the house 
6498,meanwhile  i have to go on raids  to steal replacements for all the sheep those swaggering suitors killed  and get the other greeks to give me more  until i fill my folds 
6499,but first i will
6500,go to the orchard in the countryside to see my grieving father 
6501,then at dawn the news will spread that i have killed the suitors 
6502,your orders  wife though you are smart enough to need no orders are  go with your slaves upstairs  sit quietly  and do not talk to anyone 
6503,he armed himself and called the herdsmen and telemachus  and told them to put on armor too breastplates of bronze 
6504,odysseus led all of them outside 
6505,the light was bright across the earth 
6506,athena hid them with night and brought them out of town 
6507,restless spirits then hermes called the spirits of the suitors out of the house 
6508,he held the golden wand with which he casts a spell to close men s eyes or open those of sleepers when he wants 
6509,he led the spirits and they followed  squeaking like bats in secret crannies of a cave  who cling together  and when one becomes detached and falls down from the rock  the rest flutter and squeak just so the spirits squeaked  and hurried after hermes  lord of healing 
6510,on open roads they crossed the ocean stream  went past the rock of leucas and the gates of helius the sun  and skittered through the provinces of dreams  and soon arrived in fields of asphodel  the home of shadows who have been worn to weariness by life 
6511,they found achilles ghost there  and patroclus  and ajax  the most handsome of the greeks after unmatched achilles 
6512,agamemnon had just arrived to join them  in deep grief
6513,for his own death  and with him came the others killed by aegisthus and his bodyguards 
6514,achilles ghost spoke first 
6515,o agamemnon  men used to say that out of all the heroes  zeus  lord of lightning  favored you the most  because you had command of a great army in troy where greeks endured the pain of war 
6516,but death  which no man living can avoid  was destined to arrive at the wrong time 
6517,if only you had died at troy and won
6518,the glory of your rank as a commander  all of the greeks and allies would have built a tomb for you  and afterwards your son would have received great honor 
6519,as it is  it was your fate to die a dreadful death 
6520,the ghost of agamemnon answered him  achilles  son of peleus  you were lucky to die at troy  away from argos 
6521,the finest warriors of greece and troy fought round your corpse and died 
6522,you lay a hero 
6523,magnificent amid the whirling dust  your days of driving chariots forgotten 
6524,we fought all day  and would have fought forever  but zeus sent winds to stop us 
6525,then we brought you back to our ships  and laid you on a bier  away from battle  and we bathed your skin in heated water and anointed you with oil 
6526,we wept for you and cut our hair 
6527,your mother heard the news  and with her nymphs she came up from the waves 
6528,an eerie wailing
6529,sounded across the sea 
6530,the men began to tremble  and they would have rushed on board  if wise old nestor had not made them stop 
6531,he always had the best advice for us  and said  my lords  stay here 
6532,it is his mother  coming with her immortal water nymphs to find her own dead son 
6533,at this  the greeks regained their courage 
6534,the old sea king s daughters gathered around you weeping  and they dressed you in clothes of the immortals 
6535,all nine muses
6536,sang lamentations in their lovely voices 
6537,no one could keep from crying at the sound  so moving was their song 
6538,the gods and men were mourning seventeen long nights and days and then we gave you to the pyre  and killed many fat sheep and cattle for your corpse 
6539,you burned in clothes from gods  you were anointed with oil and honey 
6540,troops of warriors on foot and horseback  fully armed  went marching around your pyre  and made a mighty din 
6541,at last hephaestus flame consumed your flesh 
6542,when morning came  we gathered your white bones  achilles  and anointed them with oil and unmixed wine 
6543,your mother gave an urn of gold with double handles  which she said hephaestus made and dionysus gave her 
6544,your white bones lay inside it  lord achilles  mixed with the bones of your dead friend patroclus 
6545,we laid the urn beside antilochus  the friend you most respected after him 
6546,the army of greek warriors assembled  and with all reverence we heaped a mound out on the headland by the hellespont  large enough to be visible to those at sea  both now and in the years to come 
6547,your mother asked the gods for splendid prizes and put them in the midst of an arena  so the best athletes could compete for them 
6548,you have seen many burials of heroes  when young men tie their tunics to compete 
6549,but you would have been startled at the riches that silver footed thetis brought for you 
6550,you were so dearly loved by all the gods 
6551,you did not lose your name in death 
6552,your fame will live forever  everyone will know achilles 
6553,as for me  what good was it that i wound up the war 
6554,when i came home aegisthus and my wicked  fiendish wife murdered me  zeus had planned it 
6555,while they talked  hermes the guide came near them  with the suitors
6556,killed by odysseus 
6557,the two great lords  astonished at the sight  rushed up to them  and agamemnon s spirit recognized the son of his old friend  menelaus  with whom he stayed in ithaca 
6558,he said  amphimedon  what happened to you all 
6559,why have you all come down here to the land of darkness 
6560,you are all so young and strong  you must have been the best boys in your town 
6561,maybe poseidon raised great waves and winds
6562,to wreck your fleet 
6563,or were you all attacked by men on land while you were poaching cows or flocks of sheep  or fighting for a city and women 
6564,you must tell me  we are friends 
6565,do you remember when i visited your home  when menelaus and myself were trying to persuade odysseus to join the fleet and sail with us to troy 
6566,it took a whole damned month to cross the sea  we had to work so hard to sway that man 
6567,who sacked the city 
6568,amphimedon s spirit answered  great general  agamemnon  yes  i do remember everything you say 
6569,and i will tell  in every gruesome detail  the manner of our death 
6570,odysseus was gone for many years 
6571,we came to court his wife  who had no wish to marry us  but would not tell us no or make an end 
6572,she planned black death for us  and tricked us  too 
6573,she set a mighty loom up in the hall 
6574,and wove a wide fine cloth  and said to us  young suitors  now odysseus is dead 
6575,i know that you are eager for the wedding  but wait till i am finished with this cloth  so that my weaving will not go to waste 
6576,it is a shroud for when laertes dies  so that the women in the town do not blame me because a man who gained such wealth was buried with no winding sheet 
6577,her words convinced us 
6578,so by day she wove the cloth 
6579,and then at night by torchlight  she unwove it 
6580,for three long years she fooled us  when the hours and months had passed  the fourth year rolled around  and then a girl who knew the truth told us  and we found her unraveling her work 
6581,we made her finish it 
6582,when she had washed the marvelous huge sheet  she showed it to us  bright as the sun or moon 
6583,and then some spirit of ruin brought odysseus from somewhere to ithaca  he went out to the fields 
6584,to where the swineherd lived 
6585,his own dear son sailed in his black ship back from sandy pylos 
6586,the two of them made plans to murder us 
6587,they showed up at the palace first the boy  and then odysseus propped on a stick and dressed in dirty rags 
6588,he seemed to be a poor old homeless man  who suddenly appeared  led by the swineherd 
6589,none of us could recognize him  even those of us who were a little older than myself 
6590,we hurled insulting words and missiles at him  and for a while he patiently endured abuse in his own home 
6591,but when the will of zeus awakened him  with his son s help  he put the splendid weapons in the storeroom and locked the door 
6592,then came his cunning plan  he told his wife to set for us the axes and bow 
6593,the competition meant our doom  the start of slaughter 
6594,none of us could string the mighty bow we all were far too weak 
6595,but when it was his turn  we shouted out that nobody should give the bow to him  no matter what he said 
6596,telemachus alone insisted that he ought to have it 
6597,at last odysseus  with calm composure  took it and strung it easily  and shot all through the iron axes 
6598,then he stood astride the threshold with a fearsome scowl  and started shooting fast 
6599,his arrow struck antinous  our leader 
6600,with sure aim
6601,he shot his deadly arrows at more men  those nearest to him fell 
6602,it was apparent some god was helping them 
6603,impelled by rage  they rushed around the palace killing us in turn 
6604,there was a dreadful noise of screaming and broken skulls  the whole floor ran with blood 
6605,so  agamemnon  we were killed 
6606,our bodies still lie unburied in our killer s house 
6607,our families at home do not yet know 
6608,they need to wash the black blood from our wounds
6609,and weep for us and lay our bodies out 
6610,this is the honor due the dead 
6611,the ghost of agamemnon answered  lucky you  cunning odysseus  you got yourself a wife of virtue great penelope 
6612,how principled she was  that she remembered her husband all those years  her fame will live forever  and the deathless gods will make a poem to delight all those on earth about intelligent penelope 
6613,not like my wife who murdered her own husband  her story will be hateful  she will bring bad reputation to all other women  even the good ones 
6614,so they spoke together  standing in hades  hidden in the earth 
6615,meanwhile  odysseus and his companions had left the town and quickly reached the farm  won by laertes long ago he fought hard for it  and his house was there  the slaves  who had to do his wishes  lived and slept
6616,and ate their food in quarters that surrounded the central house 
6617,one was from sicily  the old slave woman who took care of him out in the countryside 
6618,odysseus spoke to his slaves and to his son 
6619,go in  choose the best pig and kill it for our dinner 
6620,and i will test my father  to find out if he will know me instantly on sight  or not i have been absent for so long 
6621,at that he gave his weapons to the slaves 
6622,they quickly went inside 
6623,odysseus walked to the fruitful orchard on his quest 
6624,he did not find old dolius  the steward  nor any of his slaves or sons he had led them to gather rocks to build dry walls 
6625,odysseus father was alone  inside the well built orchard  digging earth to make it level round a tree 
6626,he wore a dirty ragged tunic  and his leggings had leather patches to protect from scratches 
6627,he wore thick gloves because of thorns  and had a cap of goatskin 
6628,he was wallowing in grief 
6629,the veteran  odysseus  seeing his father worn by age and burdened by desperate  heartfelt sorrow  stopped beneath a towering pear tree  weeping 
6630,then he wondered whether to kiss his father  twine around him  and tell him that he had come home again  and everything that happened on the way or question him 
6631,he thought it best to start
6632,by testing him with teasing and abuse 
6633,with this in mind  odysseus approached him  as he was digging round the plant  head down 
6634,his famous son stood at his side and said  old man  you know your trade and take good care of this neat garden 
6635,every plant and vine  and tree the figs  the pears  the olive trees and bed of herbs is nicely tended 
6636,but i have to say something please do not get angry at me you do not take good care
6637,of your own self 
6638,you are unkempt  old man  your skin is rough and dirty and your clothes are rags 
6639,your master is neglecting you  although you are not lazy 
6640,in your height and face  you seem a leader  not a slave 
6641,you look like someone who would bathe and eat and sleep on fluffy pillows and fine sheets  as is appropriate for older people 
6642,but tell me this  whose slave are you 
6643,whose garden do you take care of 
6644,also  have i come
6645,to ithaca  as somebody i met was telling me just now 
6646,but he was not a helpful man  when i was asking him about a friend of mine  an old guest friend  whether he is alive or dead in hades  this fellow would not say  or even listen 
6647,a while ago  in my own native land  i had a guest to stay with me  who was my dearest friend of all my visitors 
6648,he said he was from ithaca  and that
6649,laertes was his father 
6650,i had brought him into my house  and welcomed him with warmth  i can afford to be quite generous 
6651,i gave him seven heaps of golden treasure  a bowl made all of silver and inlaid with flowers  twelve unfolded cloaks  and twelve thick blankets  twelve fine mantles  and twelve tunics 
6652,also i gave him four well trained slave women  beautiful ones  whom he picked out himself 
6653,his father answered through his tears  yes  stranger 
6654,you have reached ithaca 
6655,but cruel men have taken over here 
6656,you will receive nothing for all those gifts 
6657,if you had found him still living in this land  he would have matched your gifts and welcomed you with open arms before he sent you home 
6658,initial kindness deserves due recompense 
6659,but tell me now  how long is it since that unlucky man visited you 
6660,your guest was my own son  perhaps fish ate him out at sea  so far
6661,from home and family  or birds and beasts ate him on land 
6662,his mother did not lay his body out and weep for him  nor i  his father  nor penelope his wife  a wise and wealthy woman 
6663,she has not closed her own husband s eyes or given him a funeral 
6664,the dead deserve this honor 
6665,but tell me now  who are you 
6666,from what city 
6667,who are your parents 
6668,do you have a ship docked somewhere  which conveyed you here with friends
6669,and crew 
6670,or did you sail as passenger on someone else s ship  which now is gone 
6671,lying odysseus replied  i will tell you the truth completely 
6672,i am from alybas  and i have a palace there 
6673,my name is eperitus  i am son of king apheidas  son of polypemon 
6674,an evil spirit struck me and i came from sicily against my will 
6675,my ship is docked away from town 
6676,it is five years
6677,since poor  unfortunate odysseus came to my home 
6678,as he was setting out we saw good omens birds towards the right so we were hopeful we would meet again as friends  and share more gifts 
6679,at this  a cloud of black grief wrapped itself around laertes 
6680,he poured two handfuls of the ashy dust over his gray old head  and started sobbing 
6681,odysseus felt heart wrenched to see his own beloved father in this state  sharp pain
6682,pierced through his nostrils 
6683,he rushed up to him and threw his arms around him  kissing him  and saying  father  it is me  i have been gone for twenty years  and now am home  in my own father s country 
6684,stop your tears 
6685,i will explain  though we do not have long 
6686,i killed the suitors in my house  i took revenge for all the pain they caused 
6687,laertes answered  if you are really my own son odysseus come home  show me a sign 
6688,let me be sure of it 
6689,odysseus was quick to answer 
6690,first  look here  the scar made by the boar s white tusk when i had gone to mount parnassus 
6691,you and mother sent me  to see my grandfather  autolycus  and get the gifts that he had promised me  next i will tell you all the trees that grow in this fine orchard  which you gave to me  when i was little  i would follow you around the garden  asking all their names 
6692,we walked beneath these trees  you named them all and promised them to me  ten apple trees  and thirteen pear trees  forty figs  and fifty grapevines which ripen one by one their clusters change as the weather presses from the sky  sent down by zeus 
6693,at that  laertes heart and legs gave way  he recognized the signs odysseus had given as clear proof 
6694,he threw both arms around his ruthless son  who caught him as he fainted 
6695,when his breath
6696,and mind returned  he said  o father zeus  you gods are truly rulers of olympus  if it is true the suitors have been punished for all the monstrous things they did 
6697,but i am terrified the ithacans may soon attack us here  and spread the news around to all the towns of cephallenia 
6698,scheming odysseus said  do not fear 
6699,come to the farmhouse  where i sent my boy to go with the two herdsmen  to prepare
6700,dinner as fast as possible 
6701,with this  the son and father walked towards the house 
6702,they found them serving generous plates of meat and mixing wine 
6703,the slave from sicily washed brave laertes  and she rubbed his skin with olive oil  and wrapped a handsome cloak around him 
6704,then athena  standing near  made him grow taller and more muscular 
6705,when he emerged  odysseus was shocked to see him looking like a god 
6706,his words
6707,flew fast 
6708,oh  father  you look different  a god has made you taller and more handsome 
6709,thoughtful laertes said  o father zeus  athena  and apollo  if i were as strong as when i took the sturdy fortress of nericus  out on the mainland shore  when i was king of cephallenia  i would have stood beside you yesterday  with weapons on my back  and fought with you against the suitors who were in our house 
6710,i would have brought so many of them down  you would have been delighted  so they spoke 
6711,the work of cooking dinner was complete  and they sat down on chairs and stools  and reached to take the food 
6712,the old slave dolius approached them with his sons  who had been working 
6713,their mother  the sicilian old woman  had gone to call them 
6714,she took care of them  and also the old man  made weak by age 
6715,they saw odysseus and stared  then stopped 
6716,astonished 
6717,but he spoke to reassure them 
6718,old man  sit down and eat 
6719,the rest of you  put your surprise entirely out of mind 
6720,we have been waiting ages  we are eager to have our dinner here 
6721,but dolius ran straight to him with arms outstretched  and took odysseus wrist and kissed his hand  and let his words fly out 
6722,my friend  you have come home  we are so very glad to see you  we never thought this day would come  the gods
6723,have brought you here  a heartfelt welcome to you  i pray the gods will bless you  does your wife know you have come back home 
6724,or should i send a message 
6725,but odysseus said coolly  old man  she knows already 
6726,do not bother 
6727,so dolius sat back down on his chair 
6728,his sons were also clustering around their famous owner  lord odysseus  to welcome him and hold him in their arms 
6729,then they sat down in turn beside their father 
6730,they had their meal together in the farmhouse 
6731,meanwhile  swift rumor spread the news all through the city  of the suitors dreadful murder 
6732,when people heard  they rushed from all directions towards the palace of odysseus  with shouts and lamentations 
6733,then they brought the bodies from the house and buried them 
6734,the ones from distant towns were sent back home by ship 
6735,the mourners gathered in the square  heartbroken 
6736,when the people were assembled 
6737,eupeithes first stood up and spoke to them 
6738,this man was inconsolable with grief for his dead son antinous  the boy odysseus killed first 
6739,his father wept  tears falling as he spoke 
6740,this scheming man  my friends  has done us all most monstrous wrongs 
6741,first  he took many good men off to sail with him  and lost the ships  and killed the men  now he has come and murdered all the best of cephallenia 
6742,come on  before
6743,he sneaks away to pylos or to elis  we have to act  we will be shamed forever unless we take revenge on him for killing our sons and brothers 
6744,i would have no wish to live  i would prefer to die and join the boys already dead 
6745,we have to stop them escaping overseas  come on  right now  he spoke in tears  and pity seized them all 
6746,but medon and the bard had woken up  they came outside and stood among the crowd 
6747,they all were terrified  and medon said  now listen  ithacans 
6748,odysseus could not have done such things without the help of gods 
6749,i saw a god myself  disguised as mentor  sometimes standing at his side  giving him will to fight  and sometimes rushing all through the hall to make the suitors scatter 
6750,they fell like flies 
6751,pale terror seized them all 
6752,then halitherses  an old warrior  the only one to know both past and future 
6753,stood up  he wished them well 
6754,he said to them  now hear me  ithacans 
6755,my friends  it was because of your own cowardice this happened 
6756,you did not listen to me  or to mentor  when we were telling you to stop your sons from acting stupidly 
6757,they did great wrong  through their impulsiveness  they skimmed the wealth of an important man  and disrespected his wife  believing he would never come 
6758,but listen now 
6759,we must not go and fight 
6760,or we will bring more ruin on our heads 
6761,at that  some stayed there  huddling together  but more than half jumped up with shouts 
6762,they thought eupeithes had the right idea 
6763,they rushed to arms  and strapped their gleaming armor on  and gathered in a mass before the town 
6764,eupeithes was their leader to his cost 
6765,he thought he would avenge his murdered son 
6766,in fact  he would not come back home  it was his fate to die out there 
6767,and then athena
6768,spoke to the son of cronus 
6769,father zeus  highest of powers  tell what hidden thoughts lie in you 
6770,will you now make yet more war and bitter strife  or join the sides in friendship 
6771,the gatherer of clouds replied  my child  why ask me this 
6772,the plan was your idea  to have odysseus come take revenge 
6773,do as you wish 
6774,but here is my advice 
6775,he has already punished all the suitors  so let them swear an oath that he will be
6776,the king forever  and let us make sure the murder of their brothers and their sons will be forgotten 
6777,let them all be friends  just as before  and let them live in peace and in prosperity 
6778,athena was already eager  at these words she swooped down from olympus 
6779,meanwhile  they had finished dinner  and battle scarred odysseus said  somebody must go and see if they are coming near 
6780,a son of dolius
6781,obeyed and went 
6782,as he stepped out  he stood across the threshold  and he saw them all near to the house 
6783,at once his words took wings 
6784,he told odysseus  those men are near  we have to arm  and fast  they quickly armed 
6785,odysseus  his son and their two slaves made four  and dolius had his six sons 
6786,laertes and old dolius were also needed as fighters  though they had gray hair 
6787,when all of them were dressed in gleaming bronze 
6788,they opened up the gates and went outside  odysseus was leading them 
6789,athena came near  disguised as mentor 
6790,when he saw her  weathered odysseus was glad and turned towards telemachus and said  now  son  soon you will have experience of fighting in battle  the true test of worth 
6791,you must not shame your father s family  for years we have been known across the world for courage and manliness 
6792,telemachus inhaled 
6793,then said  just watch me  father  if you want to see my spirit 
6794,i will bring no shame onto your family 
6795,you should not speak of shame 
6796,laertes  thrilled  cried out  ah  gods  a happy day for me  my son and grandson are arguing about how tough they are  with glinting eyes  athena stood beside him and said  you are my favorite  laertes 
6797,pray to the bright eyed goddess and her father  then lift and hurl your spear 
6798,as she said this 
6799,athena breathed great energy inside him 
6800,laertes quickly raised and hurled the spear  and struck eupeithes through his bronze cheeked helmet  which did not stop the weapon  it pierced through 
6801,then with a thud he fell  his armor clanged around him on the ground 
6802,odysseus charged the front line  his radiant son beside him  they hacked with swords and curving spears 
6803,they would have killed them all and made sure none of them could go back home but then athena spoke 
6804,her voice held back the fighters 
6805,ithacans  stop this destructive war  she would no more blood  and go your separate ways  at once  her voice struck them with pale green fear and made them drop their weapons 
6806,they were desperate to save their lives  and they turned back towards the city 
6807,unwavering odysseus let out a dreadful roar  then crouched and swooped upon them  just like an eagle flying from above 
6808,but zeus sent down a thunderbolt  which fell
6809,in front of his own daughter  great athena 
6810,she looked at him with steely eyes and said  odysseus  you are adaptable  you always find solutions 
6811,stop this war  or zeus will be enraged at you 
6812,he was glad to obey her 
6813,then athena made the warring sides swear solemn oaths of peace for future times still in her guise as mentor
