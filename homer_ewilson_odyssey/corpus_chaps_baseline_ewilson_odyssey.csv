The boy and the goddess tell me about a complicated man. muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost when he had wrecked the holy town of troy, and where he went, and who he met, the pain he suffered in the storms at sea, and how he worked to save his life and bring his men back home. he failed to keep them safe; poor fools, they ate the sun god s cattle, and the god kept them from home. now goddess, child of zeus, tell the old story for our modern times.

Find the beginning. all the other greeks who had survived the brutal sack of troy sailed safely home to their own wives except this man alone. calypso, a great goddess, had trapped him in her cave; she wanted him to be her husband. when the year rolled round in which the gods decreed he should go home to ithaca, his troubles still went on. the man was friendless. all the gods took pity, except poseidon s anger never ended

Until odysseus was back at home. but now the distant ethiopians, who live between the sunset and the dawn, were worshipping the sea god with a feast, a hundred cattle and a hundred rams. there sat the god, delighting in his banquet. the other gods were gathered on olympus, in father zeus  palace. he was thinking of fine, well-born aegisthus, who was killed by agamemnon s famous son orestes.

He told the deathless gods,  this is absurd, that mortals blame the gods! they say we cause their suffering, but they themselves increase it by folly. so aegisthus overstepped: he took the legal wife of agamemnon, then killed the husband when he came back home, although he knew that it would doom them all. we gods had warned aegisthus; we sent down perceptive hermes, who flashed into sight and told him not to murder agamemnon

Or court his wife, orestes would grow up and come back to his home to take revenge. aegisthus would not hear that good advice. but now his death has paid all debts.  athena looked at him steadily and answered,  father, he did deserve to die. bring death to all who act like him! but i am agonizing about odysseus and his bad luck. for too long he has suffered, with no friends, sea all around him, sea on every side,

Out on an island where a goddess lives, daughter of fearful atlas, who holds up the pillars of the sea, and knows its depths  those pillars keep the heaven and earth apart. his daughter holds that poor unhappy man, and tries beguiling him with gentle words to cease all thoughts of ithaca; but he longs to see even just the smoke that rises from his own homeland, and he wants to die. you do not even care, olympian!

Remember how he sacrificed to you on the broad plain of troy beside his ships? so why do you dismiss odysseus?   daughter!  the cloud god said,  you must be joking, since how could i forget odysseus? he is more sensible than other humans, and makes more sacrifices to the gods. but lord poseidon rages, unrelenting, because odysseus destroyed the eye of godlike polyphemus, his own son,

The strongest of the cyclopes whose mother, tho sa, is a sea-nymph, child of phorcys, the sea king; and she lay beside poseidon inside a hollow cave. so now poseidon prevents odysseus from reaching home but does not kill him. come then, we must plan: how can he get back home? poseidon must give up his anger, since he cannot fight alone against the will of all the gods.  athena s eyes lit up and she replied,

 great father, if the blessed gods at last will let odysseus return back home, then hurry, we must send our messenger, hermes the giant-slayer. he must swoop down to ogygia right away and tell the beautiful calypso we have formed a firm decision that odysseus has waited long enough. he must go home. and i will go to ithaca to rouse the courage of his son, and make him call

A meeting, and speak out against the suitors who kill his flocks of sheep and longhorn cattle unstoppably. then i will send him off to pylos and to sparta, to seek news about his father s journey home, and gain a noble reputation for himself.  with that, she tied her sandals on her feet, the marvelous golden sandals that she wears to travel sea and land, as fast as wind. she took the heavy bronze-tipped spear she uses

To tame the ranks of warriors with whom she is enraged. then from the mountain down she sped to ithaca, and stopped outside odysseus  court, bronze spear in hand. she looked like mentes now, the taphian leader, a guest-friend. there she found the lordly suitors sitting on hides they killed the cows themselves  and playing checkers. quick, attentive house slaves were waiting on them. some were mixing wine with water in the bowls, and others brought

The tables out and wiped them off with sponges, and others carved up heaping plates of meat. telemachus was sitting with them, feeling dejected. in his mind he saw his father coming from somewhere, scattering the suitors, and gaining back his honor, and control of all his property. with this in mind, he was the first to see athena there. he disapproved of leaving strangers stranded, so he went straight to meet her at the gate,

And shook her hand, and took her spear of bronze, and let his words fly out to her.  good evening, stranger, and welcome. be our guest, come share our dinner, and then tell us what you need.  he led her in, and pallas followed him. inside the high-roofed hall, he set her spear beside a pillar in a polished stand, in which odysseus kept stores of weapons. and then he led her to a chair and spread a smooth embroidered cloth across the seat,

And pulled a footstool up to it. he sat beside her on a chair of inlaid wood, a distance from the suitors, so their shouting would not upset the stranger during dinner; also to ask about his absent father. a girl brought washing water in a jug of gold, and poured it on their hands and into a silver bowl, and set a table by them. a deferential slave brought bread and laid a wide array of food, a generous spread.

The carver set beside them plates of meat of every kind, and gave them golden cups. the cup boy kept on topping up the wine. the suitors sauntered in and sat on chairs, observing proper order, and the slaves poured water on their hands. the house girls brought baskets of bread and heaped it up beside them, and house boys filled their wine-bowls up with drink. they reached to take the good things set before them. once they were satisfied with food and drink,

The suitors turned their minds to other things  singing and dancing, glories of the feast. a slave brought out a well-tuned lyre and gave it to phemius, the man the suitors forced to sing for them. he struck the chords to start his lovely song. telemachus leaned in close to athena, so they would not hear, and said,  dear guest excuse my saying this  these men are only interested in music  a life of ease. they make no contribution.

This food belongs to someone else, a man whose white bones may be lying in the rain or sunk beneath the waves. if they saw him return to ithaca, they would all pray for faster feet, instead of wealth and gold and fancy clothes. in fact, he must have died. we have no hope. he will not come back home. if someone says so, we do not believe it. but come now, tell me this and tell the truth. who are you? from what city, and what parents?

What kind of ship did you here arrive on? what sailors brought you here, and by what route? you surely did not travel here on foot! here is the thing i really want to know: have you been here before? are you a friend who visited my father? many men came to his house. he traveled many places.  athena s clear bright eyes met his. she said,  yes, i will tell you everything. i am mentes, the son of wise anchialus,

Lord of the taphians, who love the oar. i traveled with my ship and my companions over the wine-dark sea to foreign lands, with iron that i hope to trade for copper in temese. my ship is in the harbor far from the town, beneath the woody hill. and you and i are guest-friends through our fathers, from long ago laertes can confirm it. i hear that fine old man no longer comes to town, but lives out in the countryside,

Stricken by grief, with only one old slave, who gives him food and drink when he trails back leg-weary from his orchard, rich in vines. i came because they told me that your father was here but now it seems that gods have blocked his path back home. but i am sure that he is not yet dead. the wide sea keeps him trapped upon some island, captured by fierce men who will not let him go. now i will make a prophecy the gods have given me,

And i think it will all come true, although i am no prophet. he will not be gone much longer from his own dear native land, even if chains of iron hold him fast. he will devise a means of getting home. he is resourceful. tell me now are you odysseus  son? you are so tall! your handsome face and eyes resemble his. we often met and knew each other well, before he went to troy, where all the best

Leaders of argos sailed in hollow ships. from that time on, we have not seen each other.  telemachus was careful as he answered.  dear guest, i will be frank with you. my mother says that i am his son, but i cannot be sure, since no one knows his own begetting. i wish i were the son of someone lucky, who could grow old at home with all his wealth. instead, the most unlucky man alive is said to be my father since you ask. 

Athena looked at him with sparkling eyes.  son of penelope, you and your sons will make a name in history, since you are so clever. but now tell me this. who are these banqueters? and what is the occasion? a drinking party, or a wedding feast? they look so arrogant and self-indulgent, making themselves at home. a wise observer would surely disapprove of how they act.  telemachus said moodily,  my friend,

Since you have raised the subject, there was once a time when this house here was doing well, our future bright, when he was still at home. but now the gods have changed their plans and cursed us, and cast my father into utter darkness. if he had died it would not be this bad  if he had fallen with his friends at troy, or in his loved ones  arms, when he had wound the threads of war to end. the greeks would then have built a tomb for him; he would have won

Fame for his son. but now, the winds have seized him, and he is nameless and unknown. he left nothing but tears for me. i do not weep only for him. the gods have given me so many other troubles. all the chiefs of same, zacynthus, dulichium, and local lords, from rocky ithaca, are courting mother, wasting our whole house. she does not turn these awful suitors down, nor can she end the courting. they keep eating,

Spoiling my house and soon, they will kill me!  athena said in outrage,  this is monstrous! you need odysseus to come back home and lay his hands on all those shameless suitors! if only he would come here now and stand right at the gates, with two spears in his hands, in shield and helmet, as when i first saw him! odysseus was visiting our house, drinking and having fun on his way back from sailing in swift ships to ephyra

To visit ilus. he had gone there looking for deadly poison to anoint his arrows. ilus refused, because he feared the gods. my father gave odysseus the poison, loving him blindly. may odysseus come meet the suitors with that urge to kill! a bitter courtship and short life for them! but whether he comes home to take revenge, or not, is with the gods. you must consider how best to drive these suitors from your house.

Come, listen carefully to what i say. tomorrow call the achaean chiefs to meeting, and tell the suitors let the gods be witness   all of you, go away! to your own homes!  as for your mother, if she wants to marry, let her return to her great father s home. they will make her a wedding and prepare abundant gifts to show her father s love. now here is some advice from me for you. fit out a ship with twenty oars, the best,

And go find out about your long-lost father. someone may tell you news, or you may hear a voice from zeus, best source of information. first go to pylos, question godlike nestor; from there, to sparta; visit menelaus. he came home last of all the achaean heroes. if you should hear that he is still alive and coming home, put up with this abuse for one more year. but if you hear that he is dead, go home, and build a tomb for him,

And hold a lavish funeral to show the honor he deserves, and give your mother in marriage to a man. when this is done, consider deeply how you might be able to kill the suitors in your halls by tricks or openly. you must not stick to childhood; you are no longer just a little boy. you surely heard how everybody praised orestes when he killed the man who killed his famous father devious aegisthus?

Dear boy, i see how big and tall you are. be brave, and win yourself a lasting name. but i must go now, on my speedy ship; my friends are getting tired of waiting for me. remember what i said and heed my words.  telemachus was brooding on her words, and said,  dear guest, you were so kind to give me this fatherly advice. i will remember. i know that you are eager to be off, but please enjoy a bath before you go,

And take a gift with you. i want to give you a precious, pretty treasure as a keepsake to mark our special friendship.  but the goddess athena met his gaze and said,  do not hold me back now. i must be on my way. as for the gift you feel inspired to give me, save it for when i come on my way home and let me give you presents then as well in fair exchange.  with that, the owl-eyed goddess flew away like a bird, up through the smoke.

She left him feeling braver, more determined, and with his father even more in mind. watching her go, he was amazed and saw she was a god. then godlike, he went off to meet the suitors. they were sitting calmly, listening to the poet, who sang how athena cursed the journey of the greeks as they were sailing home from troy. upstairs, penelope had heard the marvelous song. she clambered down the steep steps of her house,

Not by herself two slave girls came with her. she reached the suitors looking like a goddess, then stopped and stood beside a sturdy pillar, holding a gauzy veil before her face. her slave girls stood, one on each side of her. in tears, she told the holy singer,  stop, please phemius! you know so many songs, enchanting tales of things that gods and men have done, the deeds that singers publicize. sing something else, and let them drink in peace.

Stop this upsetting song that always breaks my heart, so i can hardly bear my grief. i miss him all the time that man, my husband, whose story is so famous throughout greece.  sullen telemachus said,  mother, no, you must not criticize the loyal bard for singing as it pleases him to sing. poets are not to blame for how things are; zeus is; he gives to each as is his will. do not blame phemius because he told

About the greek disasters. you must know the newest song is always praised the most. so steel your heart and listen to the song. odysseus was not the only one who did not come back home again from troy. many were lost. go in and do your work. stick to the loom and distaff. tell your slaves to do their chores as well. it is for men to talk, especially me. i am the master.  that startled her. she went back to her room,

And took her son s uneasy words to heart. she went upstairs, along with both her slaves, and wept there for her dear odysseus, until athena gave her eyes sweet sleep. throughout the shadowy hall the suitors clamored, praying to lie beside her in her bed. telemachus inhaled, then started speaking.  you suitors, you are taking this too far. let us enjoy the feast in peace. it is a lovely thing to listen to a bard,

Especially one with such a godlike voice. at dawn, let us assemble in the square. i have to tell you this it is an order. you have to leave my halls. go dine elsewhere! eat your own food, or share between your houses. or if you think it easier and better to ruin one man s wealth, and if you think that you can get away with it go on! i call upon the gods; zeus will grant vengeance. you will be punished and destroyed, right here! 

He spoke, and they began to bite their lips, shocked that telemachus would dare to speak so boldly. but antinous replied,  telemachus, the gods themselves have taught you such pride, to talk so big and brash in public! may zeus the son of cronus never grant you your true inheritance, which is the throne of ithaca.  his mind alert and focused, telemachus replied,  antinous, you will not like this, but i have to say,

I hope zeus does give me the throne. do you deny it is an honorable thing to be a king? it brings the household wealth, and honor to the man. but there are many other great chiefs in sea-girt ithaca, both old and young. i know that. one of them may seize the throne, now that odysseus has died. but i shall be at least the lord of my own house and of the slaves that he seized for my benefit.  eurymachus

Replied,  telemachus, the gods must choose which of us will be king of ithaca. but still, i hope you keep your own possessions, and rule your house. may no man drive you out, and seize your wealth, while ithaca survives. now, friend, i want to ask about the stranger. where was he from, what country? did he say? where is his place of birth, his native soil? does he bring news your father will come home? or did he come here for some other purpose?

How suddenly he darted off, not waiting for us to meet him. yet he looked important.  the boy said soberly,  eurymachus, my father is not ever coming home. i do not listen now to any gossip, or forecasts from the psychics whom my mother invites to visit us. the stranger was my father s guest-friend mentes, son of wise anchialus, who rules the taphians, the people of the oar.  those were his words,

But in his mind he knew she was a god. they danced to music and enjoyed themselves till evening, then they went back home to sleep. telemachus  bedroom had been built above the courtyard, so it had a view. he went upstairs, preoccupied by thought. a loyal slave went with him, eurycleia, daughter of ops; she brought the burning torches. laertes bought her many years before when she was very young, for twenty oxen.

He gave her status in the household, equal to his own wife, but never slept with her, avoiding bitter feelings in his marriage. she brought the torches now; she was the slave who loved him most, since she had cared for him when he was tiny. entering the room, he sat down on the bed, took off his tunic, and gave it to the vigilant old woman. she smoothed it out and folded it, then hung it up on a hook beside his wooden bed,

And left the room. she used the silver latch to close the door; the strap pulled tight the bolt. he slept the night there, wrapped in woolen blankets, planning the journey told him by athena.",the boy and the goddess tell me about a complicated man  muse  tell me how he wandered and was lost when he had wrecked the holy town of troy  and where he went  and who he met  the pain he suffered in the

before you go   and take a gift with you  i want to give you a precious  pretty treasure as a keepsake to mark our special friendship   but the goddess athena met his gaze and said   do not hold me back now  i must be on my way  as for the gift you feel inspired to give me  save it for when i come on my way home and let me give you presents then as well in fair exchange   with that  the owl eyed goddess flew away like a bird  up through the smoke   she left him feeling braver  more determined  and with his father even more in mind  watching her go  he was amazed and saw she was a god  then godlike  he went off to meet the suitors  they were sitting calmly  listening to the poet  who sang how athena cursed the journey of the greeks as they were sailing home from troy  upstairs  penelope had heard the marvelous song  she clambered down the steep steps of her house   not by herself two slave girls came with her  she reached the suitors looking like a goddess  then stopped and stood beside a sturdy pillar  holding a gauzy veil before her face  her slave girls stood  one on each side of her  in tears  she told the holy singer   stop  please phemius  you know so many songs  enchanting tales of things that gods and men have done  the deeds that singers publicize  sing something else  and let them drink in peace   stop this upsetting song that always breaks my heart  so i can hardly bear my grief  i miss him all the time that man  my husband  whose story is so famous throughout greece   sullen telemachus said   mother  no  you must not criticize the loyal bard for singing as it pleases him to sing  poets are not to blame for how things are  zeus is  he gives to each as is his will  do not blame phemius because he told  about the greek disasters  you must know the newest song is always praised the most  so steel your heart and listen to the song  odysseus was not the only one who did not come back home again from troy  many were lost  go in and do your work  stick to the loom and distaff  tell your slaves to do their chores as well  it is for men to talk  especially me  i am the master   that startled her  she went back to her room   and took her son s uneasy words to heart  she went upstairs  along with both her slaves  and wept there for her dear odysseus  until athena gave her eyes sweet sleep  throughout the shadowy hall the suitors clamored  praying to lie beside her in her bed  telemachus inhaled  then started speaking   you suitors  you are taking this too far  let us enjoy the feast in peace  it is a lovely thing to listen to a bard   especially one with such a godlike voice  at dawn  let us assemble in the square  i have to tell you this it is an order  you have to leave my halls  go dine elsewhere  eat your own food  or share between your houses  or if you think it easier and better to ruin one man s wealth  and if you think that you can get away with it go on  i call upon the gods  zeus will grant vengeance  you will be punished and destroyed  right here    he spoke  and they began to bite their lips  shocked that telemachus would dare to speak so boldly  but antinous replied   telemachus  the gods themselves have taught you such pride  to talk so big and brash in public  may zeus the son of cronus never grant you your true inheritance  which is the throne of ithaca   his mind alert and focused  telemachus replied   antinous  you will not like this  but i have to say   i hope zeus does give me the throne  do you deny it is an honorable thing to be a king  it brings the household wealth  and honor to the man  but there are many other great chiefs in sea girt ithaca  both old and young  i know that  one of them may seize the throne  now that odysseus has died  but i shall be at least the lord of my own house and of the slaves that he seized for my benefit   eurymachus  replied   telemachus  the gods must choose which of us will be king of ithaca  but still  i hope you keep your own possessions  and rule your house  may no man drive you out  and seize your wealth  while ithaca survives  now  friend  i want to ask about the stranger  where was he from  what country  did he say  where is his place of birth  his native soil  does he bring news your father will come home  or did he come here for some other purpose   how suddenly he darted off  not waiting for us to meet him  yet he looked important   the boy said soberly   eurymachus  my father is not ever coming home  i do not listen now to any gossip  or forecasts from the psychics whom my mother invites to visit us  the stranger was my father s guest friend mentes  son of wise anchialus  who rules the taphians  the people of the oar   those were his words   but in his mind he knew she was a god  they danced to music and enjoyed themselves till evening  then they went back home to sleep  telemachus  bedroom had been built above the courtyard  so it had a view  he went upstairs  preoccupied by thought  a loyal slave went with him  eurycleia  daughter of ops  she brought the burning torches  laertes bought her many years before when she was very young  for twenty oxen   he gave her status in the household  equal to his own wife  but never slept with her  avoiding bitter feelings in his marriage  she brought the torches now  she was the slave who loved him most  since she had cared for him when he was tiny  entering the room  he sat down on the bed  took off his tunic  and gave it to the vigilant old woman  she smoothed it out and folded it  then hung it up on a hook beside his wooden bed   and left the room  she used the silver latch to close the door  the strap pulled tight the bolt  he slept the night there  wrapped in woolen blankets  planning the journey told him by

A dangerous journey the early dawn was born; her fingers bloomed. odysseus  well-beloved son jumped up, put on his clothes, and strapped his sword across his back, and tied his handsome sandals onto his well-oiled feet. he left the room looking just like a god. he quickly told the clear-voiced heralds they must call the greeks to council. soon the men, their long hair flowing, were gathered all together in the square. telemachus arrived, bronze sword in hand,

Not by himself two swift dogs came with him. athena poured a heavenly grace upon him. the elders let him join them, and he sat upon his father s throne. the first to speak was wise aegyptius, a bent old soldier. his darling son, the spear-man antiphus, had sailed with lord odysseus to troy; the cyclops killed him in his cave and made him his final course at dinner. this old father had three sons left. one teamed up with the suitors 

Eurynomus. the others spent their time working the farm. but still the father mourned the son whom he had lost. he spoke in tears.  people of ithaca, now hear my words. we have not met in council since the day odysseus departed with his ships. who called us? someone old or young? and why? has he found out an army is approaching? or does he have some other piece of news which he would like to share with all of us?

I think he is a helpful, decent man. i hope that zeus rewards his good intentions!  odysseus  loving son felt glad, and eagerly got up to speak and stood among them, in the center of the group. the competent official, named pisenor, passed him the speaking-stick; he held it up, and first addressed aegyptius.  here, sir! now look no further for the man you seek. i called the meeting. i am in deep trouble.

I have no information of an army that might attack us, nor do i have news of any other danger to our people. i need help for myself. my family has suffered two disasters. first i lost my father, who was kind to you as if you also were his sons. now, even worse, my house is being ripped apart; my wealth will soon be gone! the sons of all the nobles have shoved inside my house to court my mother,

Against her wishes. they should go and ask icarius her father to provide a dowry, and choose who should be her husband. they are too scared. instead, they haunt our house day after day, and kill our cows and pigs and good fat goats. they feast and drink red wine, not caring if they waste it all. there is no man to save the house no man like him, odysseus. i cannot fight against them; i would be useless. i have had no training.

But if i had the power, i would do it! it is unbearable, what they have done! they ruined my whole house! it is not fair! you suitors all should feel ashamed! consider what others in the neighborhood will think! and also be afraid! the angry gods will turn on you in rage; they will be shocked at all this criminal behavior! i beg you, by olympian zeus, and by the goddess who presides in human meetings:

Justice! but never mind. friends, leave me be, and let me cry and suffer by myself. or did odysseus, my warlike father, deliberately do harm to our own side? is that why you seem set on hurting me, encouraging these suitors? oh, if only you ithacans would eat my stock yourselves! if you did that, i soon would get revenge; i would come through the town and keep demanding, until it all got given back. but now,

You make me so unhappy! this is pointless!  he stopped, frustrated, flung the scepter down, and burst out crying. everyone was seized by pity. no one spoke; they hesitated to answer him unkindly. then at last antinous began.  telemachus, you stuck-up, wilful little boy! how dare you try to embarrass us and put the blame on us? we suitors have not done you wrong. go blame your precious mother! she is cunning.

It is the third year, soon it will be four, that she has cheated us of what we want. she offers hope to all, sends notes to each, but all the while her mind moves somewhere else. she came up with a special trick: she fixed a mighty loom inside the palace hall. weaving her fine long cloth, she said to us,  young men, you are my suitors. since my husband, the brave odysseus, is dead, i know you want to marry me. you must be patient;

I have worked hard to weave this winding-sheet to bury good laertes when he dies. he gained such wealth, the women would reproach me if he were buried with no shroud. please let me finish it!  and her words made sense to us. so every day she wove the mighty cloth, and then at night by torchlight, she unwove it. for three long years her trick beguiled the greeks. but when the fourth year s seasons rolled around, a woman slave who knew the truth told us.

We caught her there, unraveling the cloth, and made her finish it. this is our answer, so you and all the greeks may understand. dismiss your mother, let her father tell her to marry anyone his heart desires. athena blessed her with intelligence, great artistry and skill, a finer mind than anyone has ever had before, even the braided girls of ancient greece, tyro, alcmene, garlanded mycene 

None of them had penelope s understanding. but if she wants to go on hurting us, her plans are contrary to destiny. we suitors will keep eating up your wealth, and livelihood, as long as she pursues this plan the gods have put inside her heart. for her it may be glory, but for you, pure loss. we will not go back to our farms or anywhere, until she picks a husband.  telemachus insisted, breathing hard,

 antinous, i cannot force my mother out of the house. she gave me birth and raised me. my father is elsewhere alive or dead. if i insist my mother has to leave, icarius will make me pay the price, and gods will send more trouble; if she goes, mother will rouse up furies full of hate to take revenge, and everyone will curse me. i will not. if you feel upset, you go! out of my house! stop eating all my food!

Devour each other s property, not mine! or do you really think it right to waste one person s means of life, and go scot-free? then try it! i will call the deathless gods! may zeus give recompense some day for this! you will die here, and nobody will care!  then zeus, whose voice resounds around the world, sent down two eagles from the mountain peak. at first they hovered on the breath of wind, close by each other, balanced on their wings.

Reaching the noisy middle of the crowd, they wheeled and whirred and flapped their mighty wings, swooping at each man s head with eyes like death, and with their talons ripped each face and neck. then to the right they flew, across the town. everyone was astonished at the sight; they wondered in their hearts what this could mean. old halitherses, son of mastor, spoke. more than the other elders, this old leader excelled at prophecy and knew the birds.

He gave them good advice.  now ithacans, listen! i speak especially for the suitors. disaster rolls their way! odysseus will not be absent from his friends for long; already he is near and sows the seeds of death for all of them, and more disaster for many others in bright ithaca. we have to form a plan to make them stop. that would be best for them as well by far. i am experienced at prophecy;

My words came true for him, that mastermind, odysseus. i told him when he left for troy with all the argives, he would suffer most terribly, and all his men would die, but in the twentieth year he would come home, unrecognized. now it is coming true.  eurymachus, the son of polybus, replied,  old man, be off! go home and spout your portents to your children, or it will be worse for them. but i can read these omens

Better than you can. many birds go flying in sunlight, and not all are meaningful. odysseus is dead, away from home. i wish that you had died with him, to stop your forecasts! you are making this boy angry, hoping that he will give your household gifts. but let me tell you this, which will come true. you may know many ancient forms of wisdom, but if you tease this boy and make him angry, he will be hurt, and never get to act

On any of these prophecies of yours. and, old man, we will make you pay so much your heart will break, your pain will cut so deep. i will advise telemachus myself, in front of everyone, to send his mother back to her father s family, to fix her wedding, and the gifts a well-loved daughter should have. unless he does that, we will never cease from this torturous courtship. we are not afraid of anyone, much less this boy

With his long speeches, nor your pointless portents. they will not come to pass and they will make you hated. his house will be devoured, and payback will never come, as long as she frustrates our hopes of marriage. meanwhile, we will wait in daily hope, competing for the prize, not seeking other women as our wives.  telemachus, his mind made up, replied,  all right, eurymachus, and all of you. i will not talk about this anymore.

The gods and all of you already know. just let me have a ship and twenty men to make a journey with me, out and back, to sparta and to sandy pylos, seeking news about when my father may come home. i may hear it from somebody, or from a voice from zeus it often happens so. if i find out my father is alive and coming home, i will endure this pain for one more year. but if i hear that he

Is dead, i will come home to my own land, and build a tomb and hold the funeral rites as he deserves, and i will give my mother to a new husband.  he sat down, and up stood mentor. when odysseus sailed off, this was the friend he asked to guard his house and told the slaves to look to him as master. mentor addressed the crowd.  now ithacans! listen! this changes everything! now kings should never try to judge with righteousness

Or rule their people gently. kings should always be cruel, since the people whom he ruled as kindly as a father, have forgotten their king odysseus. i do not blame the suitors  overconfidence, rough ways and violence, in eating up his household; they risk their lives, supposing that the master will never come back home. but i do blame you others, sitting passive, never speaking against them, though you far outnumber them. 

Leocritus, euenor s son, replied,  mentor, for shame! you must have lost your mind! fool, telling us to stop our banqueting! you could not fight us; we outnumber you. even if ithacan odysseus came back and found us feasting in his house, and tried to drive us out, his wife would get no joy of his return, no matter how she misses him. if he tried fighting solo against us, he would die a cruel death.

So what you said was nonsense. anyway, we must disperse, and everyone get busy. mentor and halitherses, since you are old comrades of his father, you can guide telemachus  journey. i suspect he will not manage to go anywhere; he will just wait in ithaca for news.  the crowd broke up; the ithacans went home; the suitors, to odysseus  house. telemachus slipped out and at the beach

He dipped his hands in salty gray seawater, and asked athena,  goddess, hear my prayer! just yesterday you came and ordered me to sail the hazy sea and find out news of my long-absent father s journey home. the greeks are wasting everything, especially these bullying, mean suitors.  then athena came near him with the voice and guise of mentor, and spoke to him with words that flew like birds.  telemachus, you will be brave and thoughtful,

If your own father s forcefulness runs through you. how capable he was, in word and deed! your journey will succeed, if you are his. if you are not his son, his true-born son, i doubt you can achieve what you desire. and it is rare for sons to be like fathers; only a few are better, most are worse. but you will be no coward and no fool. you do possess your father s cunning mind, so there is hope you will do all these things.

Forget about those foolish suitors  plans. they have no brains and no morality. they do not know black doom will kill them all, and some day soon: their death is near at hand. you will achieve the journey that you seek, since i will go with you, just like a father. i will equip a good swift ship for you. now go back home to where those suitors are, and get provisions. pack them in containers: some wine in jars, and grain, the strength of men,

In sturdy skins. and i will go through town, calling for volunteers to come with us. there are a lot of ships in ithaca, both new and old. i will select the best one; we will equip her quickly and sail fast, far off across the sea.  so spoke the goddess, daughter of zeus. telemachus obeyed. his heart was troubled as he went back home. he found the arrogant suitors in the hall, skinning some goats and charring hogs for dinner.

Antinous began to laugh. he called him, and seized his hand and spoke these words to him.  telemachus, you are being so pigheaded! why not put all your troubles from your heart? come eat and drink with me, just as before. you know the greeks will fix it all for you. they will select a ship and crew, and soon you will reach pylos, where you hope to hear word of your father.  but the boy was wary, and said,  antinous, i cannot eat;

I have no peace or joy when i am with you selfish suitors. is it not enough that you destroyed my rich inheritance when i was just a little boy? but now i have grown bigger, and i got advice from other people, and my heart wells up with courage. i will try to bring down doom on your heads here at home or when i go to pylos. yes, i really will go there, as passenger, although i do not own

A ship or have a crew because of you!  he snatched his hand away. but as they feasted, the suitors started mocking him and jeering. with sneers they said,  oh no! telemachus is going to kill us! he will bring supporters from pylos or from sparta he is quite determined! or indeed he may be fetching some lethal poisons from the fertile fields of ephyra, to mix up in our wine-bowl and kill us all!  another proud young man

Said,  well, who knows, perhaps he will get lost in that curved ship, and die, so far away from all his family just like his father. and what a pity that would be for us! then we would have to share out all his wealth, and give away the house itself to her  his mother, and the man who marries her.  the boy went downstairs, to his father s storeroom, wide and high-roofed, piled high with gold and bronze and clothes in chests and fragrant olive oil.

Down there the jars of vintage wine were stored, which held the sweet, unmixed and godlike drink, lined in a row against the wall, in case weary odysseus came home at last. the double doors were locked and closely fitted. a woman checked the contents, night and day, guarding it all with great intelligence, and that was eurycleia, child of ops. he called her to the chamber and addressed her.  nanny, please pour sweet wine in jugs for me,

The second best one, not the one you keep for when the poor unlucky king escapes from evil fate and death, and comes back home. fill up twelve jugs with wine for me, and pour me some twenty pounds of fine-milled barley-groats, all packed in sturdy leather bags. load up all these provisions secretly. at nightfall, i will come here and get them, when my mother has gone upstairs to go to sleep. i am leaving for sparta and for sandy pylos,

To learn about my father s journey home.  at that his loving nurse began to wail, and sobbed,  sweet child! what gave you this idea? why do you want to go so far? you are an only child, and dearly loved! the king, odysseus, is gone, lost, far from home, and they will plot against you when you leave, scheming to murder you and share this wealth. stay with us, we who love you! do not go searching for danger out on restless seas! 

Telemachus decisively replied,  nanny, you need not worry. gods have blessed this plan. but promise me you will not tell mother, until she notices me gone. say nothing for twelve days, so she will not start crying; it would spoil her pretty skin.  at that the old nurse swore a mighty oath by all the gods that she would keep the secret, and then she drew the wine for him in jars, and poured the barley-groats in well-stitched bags.

Telemachus returned to see the suitors. meanwhile, bright-eyed athena had a plan. resembling telemachus, she went all through the city, standing by each man, and urged them to assemble by the ship at night, and asked the son of phronius, no mon, for his speedy ship; he promised to give it gladly. then the sun went down and all the streets grew dark. the goddess dragged the ship into the water, and she loaded

The necessary tackle for a journey. right at the beach s farthest end the goddess stood and assembled good strong men as crew; she coached each one. then, eyes ablaze with plans, she went back to odysseus  house, and poured sweet sleep upon the drunken suitors. she struck them and their cups fell from their hands. disguised as mentor both in looks and voice, she called the boy out from the mighty hall, and looked intently in his face, and said,

 telemachus, your crew of armored men is ready at the oar for your departure. come on! no time to waste! we must be gone!  so speaking, pallas quickly led the boy; he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. they went down to the seashore and the ship, and found the long-haired sailors on the beach. inspired and confident, telemachus called out,  my friends! come on, let us go fetch the rations; they are ready in the hall.

But quietly my mother does not know, nor do the other women, except one.  and so he led them, and they followed him. they loaded everything upon the decks; odysseus  son instructed them, and then embarked athena led the way. she sat down in the stern, and next to her telemachus was sitting. then the crew released the ropes and boarded, each at oar. athena called a favorable wind,

Pure zephyr whistling on wine-dark sea. telemachus commanded his companions to seize the rigging; so they did, and raised the pine-wood mast inside the rounded block, and bound it down with forestays round about, and raised the bright white sails with leather ropes. wind blew the middle sail; the purple wave was splashing loudly round the moving keel. the goddess rode the waves and smoothed the way. the quick black ship held steady, so they fastened

The tackle down, and filled their cups with wine. they poured libations to the deathless gods, especially to the bright-eyed child of zeus. all through the night till dawn the ship sailed on.",a

you want to marry me  you must be patient   i have worked hard to weave this winding sheet to bury good laertes when he dies  he gained such wealth  the women would reproach me if he were buried with no shroud  please let me finish it   and her words made sense to us  so every day she wove the mighty cloth  and then at night by torchlight  she unwove it  for three long years her trick beguiled the greeks  but when the fourth year s seasons rolled around  a woman slave who knew the truth told us   we caught her there  unraveling the cloth  and made her finish it  this is our answer  so you and all the greeks may understand  dismiss your mother  let her father tell her to marry anyone his heart desires  athena blessed her with intelligence  great artistry and skill  a finer mind than anyone has ever had before  even the braided girls of ancient greece  tyro  alcmene  garlanded mycene   none of them had penelope s understanding  but if she wants to go on hurting us  her plans are contrary to destiny  we suitors will keep eating up your wealth  and livelihood  as long as she pursues this plan the gods have put inside her heart  for her it may be glory  but for you  pure loss  we will not go back to our farms or anywhere  until she picks a husband   telemachus insisted  breathing hard    antinous  i cannot force my mother out of the house  she gave me birth and raised me  my father is elsewhere alive or dead  if i insist my mother has to leave  icarius will make me pay the price  and gods will send more trouble  if she goes  mother will rouse up furies full of hate to take revenge  and everyone will curse me  i will not  if you feel upset  you go  out of my house  stop eating all my food   devour each other s property  not mine  or do you really think it right to waste one person s means of life  and go scot free  then try it  i will call the deathless gods  may zeus give recompense some day for this  you will die here  and nobody will care   then zeus  whose voice resounds around the world  sent down two eagles from the mountain peak  at first they hovered on the breath of wind  close by each other  balanced on their wings   reaching the noisy middle of the crowd  they wheeled and whirred and flapped their mighty wings  swooping at each man s head with eyes like death  and with their talons ripped each face and neck  then to the right they flew  across the town  everyone was astonished at the sight  they wondered in their hearts what this could mean  old halitherses  son of mastor  spoke  more than the other elders  this old leader excelled at prophecy and knew the birds   he gave them good advice   now ithacans  listen  i speak especially for the suitors  disaster rolls their way  odysseus will not be absent from his friends for long  already he is near and sows the seeds of death for all of them  and more disaster for many others in bright ithaca  we have to form a plan to make them stop  that would be best for them as well by far  i am experienced at prophecy   my words came true for him  that mastermind  odysseus  i told him when he left for troy with all the argives  he would suffer most terribly  and all his men would die  but in the twentieth year he would come home  unrecognized  now it is coming true   eurymachus  the son of polybus  replied   old man  be off  go home and spout your portents to your children  or it will be worse for them  but i can read these omens  better than you can  many birds go flying in sunlight  and not all are meaningful  odysseus is dead  away from home  i wish that you had died with him  to stop your forecasts  you are making this boy angry  hoping that he will give your household gifts  but let me tell you this  which will come true  you may know many ancient forms of wisdom  but if you tease this boy and make him angry  he will be hurt  and never get to act  on any of these prophecies of yours  and  old man  we will make you pay so much your heart will break  your pain will cut so deep  i will advise telemachus myself  in front of everyone  to send his mother back to her father s family  to fix her wedding  and the gifts a well loved daughter should have  unless he does that  we will never cease from this torturous courtship  we are not afraid of anyone  much less this boy  with his long speeches  nor your pointless portents  they will not come to pass and they will make you hated  his house will be devoured  and payback will never come  as long as she frustrates our hopes of marriage  meanwhile  we will wait in daily hope  competing for the prize  not seeking other women as our wives   telemachus  his mind made up  replied   all right  eurymachus  and all of you  i will not talk about this anymore   the gods and all of you already know  just let me have a ship and twenty men to make a journey with me  out and back  to sparta and to sandy pylos  seeking news about when my father may come home  i may hear it from somebody  or from a voice from zeus it often happens so  if i find out my father is alive and coming home  i will endure this pain for one more year  but if i hear that he  is dead  i will come home to my own land  and build a tomb and hold the funeral rites as he deserves  and i will give my mother to a new husband   he sat down  and up stood mentor  when odysseus sailed off  this was the friend he asked to guard his house and told the slaves to look to him as master  mentor addressed the crowd   now ithacans  listen  this changes everything  now kings should never try to judge with righteousness  or rule their people gently  kings should always be cruel  since the people whom he ruled as kindly as a father  have forgotten their king odysseus  i do not blame the suitors  overconfidence  rough ways and violence  in eating up his household  they risk their lives  supposing that the master will never come back home  but i do blame you others  sitting passive  never speaking against them  though you far outnumber them    leocritus  euenor s son  replied   mentor  for shame  you must have lost your mind  fool  telling us to stop our banqueting  you could not fight us  we outnumber you  even if ithacan odysseus came back and found us feasting in his house  and tried to drive us out  his wife would get no joy of his return  no matter how she misses him  if he tried fighting solo against us  he would die a cruel death   so what you said was nonsense  anyway  we must disperse  and everyone get busy  mentor and halitherses  since you are old comrades of his father  you can guide telemachus  journey  i suspect he will not manage to go anywhere  he will just wait in ithaca for news   the crowd broke up  the ithacans went home  the suitors  to odysseus  house  telemachus slipped out and at the beach  he dipped his hands in salty gray seawater  and asked athena   goddess  hear my prayer  just yesterday you came and ordered me to sail the hazy sea and find out news of my long absent father s journey home  the greeks are wasting everything  especially these bullying  mean suitors   then athena came near him with the voice and guise of mentor  and spoke to him with words that flew like birds   telemachus  you will be brave and thoughtful   if your own father s forcefulness runs through you  how capable he was  in word and deed  your journey will succeed  if you are his  if you are not his son  his true born son  i doubt you can achieve what you desire  and it is rare for sons to be like fathers  only a few are better  most are worse  but you will be no coward and no fool  you do possess your father s cunning mind  so there is hope you will do all these things   forget about those foolish suitors  plans  they have no brains and no morality  they do not know black doom will kill them all  and some day soon  their death is near at hand  you will achieve the journey that you seek  since i will go with you  just like a father  i will equip a good swift ship for you  now go back home to where those suitors are  and get provisions  pack them in containers  some wine in jars  and grain  the strength of men   in sturdy skins  and i will go through town  calling for volunteers to come with us  there are a lot of ships in ithaca  both new and old  i will select the best one  we will equip her quickly and sail fast  far off across the sea   so spoke the goddess  daughter of zeus  telemachus obeyed  his heart was troubled as he went back home  he found the arrogant suitors in the hall  skinning some goats and charring hogs for dinner   antinous began to laugh  he called him  and seized his hand and spoke these words to him   telemachus  you are being so pigheaded  why not put all your troubles from your heart  come eat and drink with me  just as before  you know the greeks will fix it all for you  they will select a ship and crew  and soon you will reach pylos  where you hope to hear word of your father   but the boy was wary  and said   antinous  i cannot eat   i have no peace or joy when i am with you selfish suitors  is it not enough that you destroyed my rich inheritance when i was just a little boy  but now i have grown bigger  and i got advice from other people  and my heart wells up with courage  i will try to bring down doom on your heads here at home or when i go to pylos  yes  i really will go there  as passenger  although i do not own  a ship or have a crew because of you   he snatched his hand away  but as they feasted  the suitors started mocking him and jeering  with sneers they said   oh no  telemachus is going to kill us  he will bring supporters from pylos or from sparta he is quite determined  or indeed he may be fetching some lethal poisons from the fertile fields of ephyra  to mix up in our wine bowl and kill us all   another proud young man  said   well  who knows  perhaps he will get lost in that curved ship  and die  so far away from all his family just like his father  and what a pity that would be for us  then we would have to share out all his wealth  and give away the house itself to her  his mother  and the man who marries her   the boy went downstairs  to his father s storeroom  wide and high roofed  piled high with gold and bronze and clothes in chests and fragrant olive oil   down there the jars of vintage wine were stored  which held the sweet  unmixed and godlike drink  lined in a row against the wall  in case weary odysseus came home at last  the double doors were locked and closely fitted  a woman checked the contents  night and day  guarding it all with great intelligence  and that was eurycleia  child of ops  he called her to the chamber and addressed her   nanny  please pour sweet wine in jugs for me   the second best one  not the one you keep for when the poor unlucky king escapes from evil fate and death  and comes back home  fill up twelve jugs with wine for me  and pour me some twenty pounds of fine milled barley groats  all packed in sturdy leather bags  load up all these provisions secretly  at nightfall  i will come here and get them  when my mother has gone upstairs to go to sleep  i am leaving for sparta and for sandy pylos   to learn about my father s journey home   at that his loving nurse began to wail  and sobbed   sweet child  what gave you this idea  why do you want to go so far  you are an only child  and dearly loved  the king  odysseus  is gone  lost  far from home  and they will plot against you when you leave  scheming to murder you and share this wealth  stay with us  we who love you  do not go searching for danger out on restless seas    telemachus decisively replied   nanny  you need not worry  gods have blessed this plan  but promise me you will not tell mother  until she notices me gone  say nothing for twelve days  so she will not start crying  it would spoil her pretty skin   at that the old nurse swore a mighty oath by all the gods that she would keep the secret  and then she drew the wine for him in jars  and poured the barley groats in well stitched bags   telemachus returned to see the suitors  meanwhile  bright eyed athena had a plan  resembling telemachus  she went all through the city  standing by each man  and urged them to assemble by the ship at night  and asked the son of phronius  no mon  for his speedy ship  he promised to give it gladly  then the sun went down and all the streets grew dark  the goddess dragged the ship into the water  and she loaded  the necessary tackle for a journey  right at the beach s farthest end the goddess stood and assembled good strong men as crew  she coached each one  then  eyes ablaze with plans  she went back to odysseus  house  and poured sweet sleep upon the drunken suitors  she struck them and their cups fell from their hands  disguised as mentor both in looks and voice  she called the boy out from the mighty hall  and looked intently in his face  and said    telemachus  your crew of armored men is ready at the oar for your departure  come on  no time to waste  we must be gone   so speaking  pallas quickly led the boy  he followed in the footsteps of the goddess  they went down to the seashore and the ship  and found the long haired sailors on the beach  inspired and confident  telemachus called out   my friends  come on  let us go fetch the rations  they are ready in the hall   but quietly my mother does not know  nor do the other women  except one   and so he led them  and they followed him  they loaded everything upon the decks  odysseus  son instructed them  and then embarked athena led the way  she sat down in the stern  and next to her telemachus was sitting  then the crew released the ropes and boarded  each at oar  athena called a favorable wind   pure zephyr whistling on wine dark sea  telemachus commanded his companions to seize the rigging  so they did  and raised the pine wood mast inside the rounded block  and bound it down with forestays round about  and raised the bright white sails with leather ropes  wind blew the middle sail  the purple wave was splashing loudly round the moving keel  the goddess rode the waves and smoothed the way  the quick black ship held steady  so they fastened  the tackle down  and filled their cups with wine  they poured libations to the deathless gods  especially to the bright eyed child of zeus  all through the night till dawn the ship sailed

An old king remembers leaving the ocean s streams, the sun leapt up into the sky of bronze, to shine his light for gods and mortals on the fertile earth. telemachus arrived in pylos, where the pylians were bringing to the beach black bulls for blue poseidon, lord of earthquakes. there were nine benches, fifty men on each, and each group had nine bulls to sacrifice. they burned the thigh-bones for the god, and ate the innards. then the ithacans arrived,

Took down their sails, dropped anchor and alighted. the goddess with the flashing eyes, athena, first led telemachus onshore, then spoke.  do not be shy, telemachus. you sailed over the sea to ask about your father, where the earth hides him, what his fate might be. so hurry now to nestor, lord of horses. learn what advice he has in mind for you. supplicate him yourself, and he will tell you the truth; he is not one to tell a lie. 

Telemachus replied,  but mentor, how can i approach and talk to him? i am quite inexperienced at making speeches, and as a young man, i feel awkward talking to elders.  she looked straight into his eyes, and answered,  you will work out what to do, through your own wits and with divine assistance. the gods have blessed you in your life so far.  so pallas spoke and quickly led him on; he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.

They reached the center of the town, where nestor was sitting with his sons and his companions, putting the meat on spits and roasting it for dinner. when they saw the strangers coming, they all stood up with open arms to greet them, inviting them to join them. nestor s son, pisistratus, shook hands and sat them down, spreading soft fleeces on the sand beside his father and his brother, thrasymedes. he served them giblets and he poured some wine

Into a golden cup, and raised a toast to pallas, child of zeus the aegis-lord.  now guest, give prayers of thanks to lord poseidon, and pour libations for the god. this feast is in his honor; pay him proper dues. then give the boy the cup of honeyed wine, so he can offer to the deathless gods libations. everybody needs the gods. i give the golden chalice to you first, because the boy is younger, more my age. 

He put the cup of sweet wine in her hand. athena was impressed with his good manners, because he rightly gave it first to her. at once she made a heartfelt prayer.  poseidon! o shaker of the earth, do not refuse to grant our prayer; may all these things come true. bring fame to nestor and his sons, and grant gifts to the pylians, as recompense for this fine sacrifice. and may the quest for which we sailed here in our swift black ship

Succeed, and may we come home safe again.  she made her prayer come true all by herself. she gave telemachus the splendid cup with double handle, and his prayer matched hers. and then they cooked the outer parts of meat, and helped themselves to pieces, sharing round the glorious feast, till they could eat no more. then first gerenian nestor, horse-lord, spoke.  now that our guests are satisfied with food, time now to talk to them and ask them questions.

Strangers, who are you? where did you sail from? are you on business, or just scouting round like pirates on the sea, who risk their lives to ravage foreign homes?  telemachus was thoughtful but not shy. athena gave him the confidence deep in his heart to ask about his absent father, and to gain a noble reputation for himself.  great nestor, son of neleus,  he said,  you ask where i am from. i will be frank.

I come from ithaca, beneath mount neion, and i am here on private, family business. i came to gather news about my father, long-suffering odysseus. they say he fought with you to sack the town of troy. we know the place where all the other men who battled with the trojans lost their lives. but zeus still keeps odysseus  fate in darkness; no one knows where he was lost. maybe some hostile men killed him on land,

Or he was drowned in amphitrite s waves. i beg you, tell me, did you see him die with your own eyes? or have you any news about where he may be? he must be lost. his mother surely bore him for misfortune. you need not sweeten what you say, in pity or from embarrassment. just tell me straight what your eyes saw of him, my noble father. if ever he made promises to you and kept his word at troy, in times of trouble,

Remember those times now. tell me the truth!  gerenian nestor, horse-lord, answered him,  dear boy, you call to mind how much we suffered, with strong, unyielding hearts, in distant lands when we were sailing over misty seas, led by achilles on a hunt for spoils, and when we fought around the mighty city of priam. our best warriors were killed. ajax lies dead there, and there lies achilles; there lies his godlike friend and guide, patroclus;

My own strong, matchless son lies dead there too, antilochus, who fought and ran so well. more pain, more grief our sufferings increased. who could recount so many, many losses? if you stayed here five years and kept on asking how many things the fighters suffered there, you would get bored and go back home again before the story ended. nine long years we schemed to bring them down, and finally zeus made our plots succeed. odysseus,

Your father, if you really are his son  well, no one dared to try to equal him in cleverness. that man was always best at every kind of trick. and seeing you, i am amazed at how you talk like him. one would not think so young a man could do it. well, back in troy, odysseus and i always agreed in councils, with one mind. we gave the argives all the best advice. after we conquered priam s lofty town,

A god dispersed the ships of the achaeans. zeus planned a bitter journey home for us, since some of us had neither sense nor morals. gray-eyed athena, daughter of the thunder, became enraged and brought about disaster. she set the sons of atreus to fight each other. hastily, they called the people at sunset, not observing proper norms. the men arrived already drunk on wine; the brothers told them why they called the meeting.

Then menelaus said that it was time to sail back home across the open sea. but agamemnon disagreed entirely. he wanted them to stay and sacrifice to heal the sickness of athena s wrath  pointless! he did not know she would not yield. the minds of the immortals rarely change. so those two stood and argued angrily, and with a dreadful clash of arms the greeks leapt up on two opposing sides. we slept

That eerie night with hearts intent on hatred against each other since zeus meant us harm. at dawn one group of us dragged down our ships into the sea piled high with loot and women, while half the army still remained there, stationed with agamemnon, shepherd of the people. my friends and i set sail with all good speed  a god had made the choppy sea lie calm. we came to tenedos and sacrificed, praying to get back home but zeus refused;

The cruel god roused yet more strife among us. your father s plans were always flexible: his men turned round their prows and sailed right back to make their peace again with agamemnon. but i assembled all my fleet, and fled  i understood some god must mean us harm. then diomedes roused his men to come, and ruddy menelaus quickly sailed to meet with us on lesbos, and we pondered our long sea journey. should we travel north,

Go past the rocks of chios to our left, to psyria, or under chios, passing blustery mimas? so we prayed for signs. the god told us to cross the open sea towards euboea, to escape disaster. a fair wind whistled and our ships sped on across the journey-ways of fish, and landed at nightfall in geraestus. to poseidon we offered many bulls, since we had crossed safely across wide waters. the fourth day

The men of diomedes moored their ships at argos; i kept going on, to pylos. the wind the god had sent kept holding strong the whole way home. so, my dear boy, i have no news about what happened next. i do not know which of them has died and who is safe. but i can tell you what i heard while sitting here in my halls. you ought to know. they say achilles  son led home the myrmidons, and philoctetes came back home with glory.

And idomeneus led back his crew to crete; no man of his who had survived the war was lost at sea. and agamemnon? you must have heard, though you live far away. aegisthus murdered him! but he has paid a bitter price. how fortunate the dead man had left a son to take revenge upon the wicked, scheming killer, that aegisthus, who killed orestes  father. my dear boy, i see that you are tall and strong. be brave,

So you will be remembered.  thoughtfully telemachus replied,  your majesty, king nestor, yes. orestes took revenge. the greeks will make him famous through the world and into future times. i wish the gods would grant me that much power against those men who threaten and insult me those cruel suitors! the gods have not yet granted us this blessing, my father and myself. we must endure.  gerenian nestor, lord of horses, answered,

 dear boy, since you have brought the subject up, i have been told about your mother s suitors, how badly they are treating you at home. but do you willingly submit to it? or has a god s voice led the townspeople to hate you? well, who knows, perhaps one day he will come home and take revenge, alone, or with an army of the greeks. if only athena loved you, as she used to care for glorious odysseus at troy

When we were doing badly. i have never seen gods display such favor as she gave when she stood by your father. if she helped you with that much love, the suitors would forget their hopes for marriage.  then telemachus replied,  my lord, i doubt that this will happen. i am surprised you have such confidence. i would not be so hopeful, even if the gods were willing.  then the goddess spoke.  telemachus, what do you mean? a god

Can easily save anyone, at will, no matter what the distance. i would rather suffer immensely, but then get home safe, than die on my return like agamemnon, murdered by his own wife, and by aegisthus. but death is universal. even gods cannot protect the people that they love, when fate and cruel death catch up with them.  telemachus said apprehensively,  mentor, this is upsetting. change the subject.

He has no real chance now of getting home. the gods have fenced him round with death and darkness. let me ask nestor something else he is wiser and more informed than anyone. they say he ruled for three whole generations. he looks to me like some immortal god. so nestor, son of neleus, tell me truly, how did the great king agamemnon die? and where was menelaus? was he lost, away from greece, when that aegisthus dared

To kill a king, a better man than him? how did that wicked trickster s plot succeed?  gerenian nestor, lord of horses, answered,  i will tell everything though you can guess what would have happened if fair menelaus had found aegisthus living in his halls on his return. and even when he died, no one would bury him; he lay upon the open plain without a tomb and far from town for birds and dogs to eat. no greek

Would mourn that monster. while we fought and labored at troy, this layabout sat safe in argos, seducing clytemnestra, noble wife of agamemnon. for a while, she scorned his foul suggestions, since her heart was good. moreover, when her husband went to troy, he left a poet, ordered to protect her. but finally fate forced the queen to yield. aegisthus left the poet to be eaten by birds, abandoned on a desert island.

He led the woman back to his own house by mutual desire, and then he made numerous offerings on holy altars of animals and lovely gold and cloth: he had succeeded far beyond his hopes. and meanwhile, i left troy with menelaus; we sailed together, best of friends. we reached the holy cape of athens, sounion. there phoebus with his gentle arrows shot and killed the pilot, phrontis, as he held

The ship s helm as she sped along. no man knew better how to steer through any storm, so menelaus stopped to bury him with proper rites. at last he sailed again across the wine-dark sea; but as his ships rushed round the craggy heights of malea, far-seeing zeus sent curses on his journey, pouring out screaming winds and giant waves the size of mountains splitting up the fleet. some ships were hurled to crete, to river jardan,

Where the cydonian people have their homes. there steep rock rises sheer above the sea near gortyn in the misty deep; south winds drive mighty waves towards the left-hand crag, and push them west to phaestus; one small rock restrains the massive currents. all the ships were smashed by waves against those rocks. the men were almost drowned. five other dark-prowed ships were blown by wind and sea away to egypt. there menelaus gathered wealth and gold

And drifted with his ships through foreign lands. meanwhile at home, aegisthus had been plotting. he killed the son of atreus and seized control of rich mycenae, where he reigned for seven years. but in the eighth, orestes came to destroy him. he returned from athens, and killed his father s murderer, then called the argives to a funeral, a feast for clever, scheming, cowardly aegisthus whom he had killed, and his own hated mother.

That very day, rambunctious menelaus arrived with all his ships crammed full of treasure. the moral is, you must not stay away too long, dear boy, when those proud suitors lurk inside your house. they may divide your wealth among themselves and make your journey useless. but i suggest you go to menelaus. he recently returned from lands so distant no one would even hope to get home safe once driven by the winds so far off course,

Over such dangerous, enormous seas. birds migrate there and take a year or more to travel back. go visit him by ship with your own crew. or if you would prefer, you can go there by land here is a carriage. my sons can guide you all the way to sparta, to menelaus. ask him for the truth. he will not lie; he is an honest man.  the sun went down and darkness fell. the goddess, bright-eyed athena, spoke to them.  king nestor,

Your speech was good and your advice was sound. but now slice up the tongues and pour the wine for lord poseidon and the other gods before we rest time now to go to bed. the light is fading and it is not right to linger at a banquet in the dark.  the people listened to athena s words. the house slaves poured fresh water on their hands, and boys filled up the mixing bowls with wine, and poured it into cups, and first prepared

The sacrifice. they threw tongues on the fire, then sprinkled wine, then each man drank his fill. then zeus  daughter and the godlike boy both rose to go together to their ship. but nestor called to stop them.  zeus forbids it! and all the other gods who live forever! you cannot leave my house for your swift ship as if i were a poor and ragged man with so few beds and blankets in his home that neither he nor guests can sleep in comfort.

I have soft quilts and blankets in abundance. the darling son of great odysseus must not sleep on the ship s deck, while i live! not while my sons remain here in my house, ready to welcome anyone who visits.  the bright-eyed goddess answered him,  old friend, you are quite right. telemachus should do just as you say. that is a better plan. he will stay here tonight and go to sleep in your fine palace. but i must go back

To tell the crew the news and keep them strong. you see, i am the oldest in our party. the rest are younger men, close friends together, the same age as our brave telemachus. i will sleep there beside the hollow ship. at dawn i have important obligations: to visit with the great cauconians. the boy can be your guest. then send him off escorted by your son. give him a carriage, drawn by your strongest and most nimble horses. 

Bright-eyed athena flew away, transformed into an ossifrage. astonishment seized all the people watching, even nestor. he seized telemachus  hand and said,  dear boy, i am now sure that you will be a hero, since the gods are on your side at your young age. this was a god, none other than great athena, true-born child of zeus, who also glorified your noble father. goddess, be kind to us as well, and grant

Honor to me, my good wife, and our sons. now i will sacrifice a yearling heifer, broad-browed and still unyoked, and gild her horns with gold to bless your journey.  so he spoke, and pallas heard his prayer. gerenian nestor led them and led his sons and sons-in-law inside his own magnificent great hall. when they were all inside, he seated them on benches and on chairs arranged in order, and he himself mixed up the bowl for them

Of sweet delicious wine. he had preserved it eleven years. the slave girl opened it, pulling the lid off. as the old man mixed, he prayed and poured libations for athena. they all poured also, then they drank their fill, then each went home to sleep in his own chamber. nestor the horseman made a special bed right there for his dear friend, the warrior s son: a camp bed on the echoing portico, beside pisistratus, the only son

Not living with a wife but still at home. nestor himself slept by his wife, the queen, in a secluded corner of the palace. when newborn dawn appeared with rosy fingers, the horse-lord nestor jumped up out of bed, and hurried down towards the polished stones that stood outside his palace, bright with oil. there neleus used to give godlike advice, until fate took him and he went to hades, and nestor, guardian of the greeks, took over

The scepter. from their rooms his sons arrived to throng around him: echephron and stratius, aretus, perseus, great thrasymedes, and strong pisistratus the sixth. they brought godlike telemachus to sit with them. nestor spoke first.  dear sons, now hurry up, fulfill my wishes. first we must appease athena, who revealed herself to me during the holy feast. now one of you must run down to the fields to choose a cow;

Let herdsmen drive her back here. and another, go to telemachus  ship and bring the men leave only two behind. another must bring laerces here, who pours the gold, so he can gild the heifer s horns. you others, stay here together. tell the girls inside to cook a royal feast, and set out seats, put wood around the altar, and clear water.  at that, the sons all got to work. the cow was brought up from the field. the crew arrived

From the swift, solid ship. the goldsmith came with all the bronze tools useful for his trade  hammer and anvil and well-crafted tongs  and worked the gold. athena came to take the sacrifice. king nestor gave the gold; the craftsman poured it on the horns, to make a lovely offering to please the goddess. stratius and echephron together led the heifer by the horns. aretes came and brought a water bowl adorned with flowers,

And in his other hand, a box of grain. strong thrasymedes stood nearby and held a sharpened axe, prepared to strike the cow. perseus held the blood-bowl. nestor started to sprinkle barley-groats and ritual water, and as he threw the hairs into the fire he said prayers to athena. when the rites were finished, mighty thrasymedes struck. the axe sliced through the sinews of the neck. the cow was paralyzed. then nestor s daughters

And his sons  wives, and his own loyal queen, eurydice, began to chant. the men hoisted the body, and pisistratus sliced through her throat. black blood poured out. the life was gone. they butchered her, cut out the thighs, all in the proper place, and covered them with double fat and placed raw flesh upon them. the old king burned the pieces on the logs, and poured the bright red wine. the young men came to stand beside him holding five-pronged forks.

They burned the thigh-bones thoroughly and tasted the entrails, then carved up the rest and skewered the meat on pointed spits, and roasted it. meanwhile, telemachus was being washed by nestor s eldest daughter, polycaste. when she had washed and rubbed his skin with oil she dressed him in a tunic and fine cloak and he emerged; his looks were like a god s. he sat by nestor, shepherd of the people. the meat was roasted and drawn off the spits.

They sat to eat, while trained slaves served the food, pouring the wine for them in golden cups. after their hunger and their thirst were gone, gerenian nestor, horse-lord, started talking.  my sons, now bring two horses with fine manes and yoke them to the carriage, so our guest can start his journey.  they obeyed at once, and quickly latched swift horses to the carriage. one of the house girls brought out food and wine and delicacies fit to feed a king.

Telemachus got in the lovely carriage; pisistratus, the son of nestor, followed, and sat beside him, taking up the reins, and whipped the horses. eagerly they flew off for the open plain, and left the town. all day they ran and made the harness rattle. at sunset when the streets grew dark, they came to pherae, to the home of diocles, son of ortilochus; alpheus was his grandfather. they spent the night as guests.

When rosy-fingered dawn came bright and early, they yoked the horses to the painted carriage, and drove out from the gate and echoing porch. at a light touch of whip, the horses flew. swiftly they drew towards their journey s end, on through the fields of wheat, until the sun began to set and shadows filled the streets.",an old king remembers leaving the ocean s streams  the sun leapt up into the sky of bronze  to shine his light for gods and mortals on the fertile earth  telemachus arrived in pylos  where the pylians were bringing to the beach black bulls for blue poseidon  lord of earthquakes  there were nine benches  fifty men on each  and each group had nine bulls to sacrifice  they burned the thigh bones for the god  and ate the innards  then the ithacans arrived   took down their sails  dropped anchor and alighted  the goddess with the flashing eyes  athena  first led telemachus onshore  then spoke   do not be shy  telemachus  you sailed over the sea to ask about your father  where the earth hides him  what his fate might be  so hurry now to nestor  lord of horses  learn what advice he has in mind for you  supplicate him yourself  and he will tell you the truth  he is not one to tell a lie    telemachus replied   but mentor  how can i approach and talk to him  i am quite inexperienced at making speeches  and as a young man  i feel awkward talking to elders   she looked straight into his eyes  and answered   you will work out what to do  through your own wits and with divine assistance  the gods have blessed you in your life so far   so pallas spoke and quickly led him on  he followed in the footsteps of the goddess   they reached the center of the town  where nestor was sitting with his sons and his companions  putting the meat on spits and roasting it for dinner  when they saw the strangers coming  they all stood up with open arms to greet them  inviting them to join them  nestor s son  pisistratus  shook hands and sat them down  spreading soft fleeces on the sand beside his father and his brother  thrasymedes  he served them giblets and he poured some wine  into a golden cup  and raised a toast to pallas  child of zeus the aegis lord   now guest  give prayers of thanks to lord poseidon  and pour libations for the god  this feast is in his honor  pay him proper dues  then give the boy the cup of honeyed wine  so he can offer to the deathless gods libations  everybody needs the gods  i give the golden chalice to you first  because the boy is younger  more my age    he put the cup of sweet wine in her hand  athena was impressed with his good manners  because he rightly gave it first to her  at once she made a heartfelt prayer   poseidon  o shaker of the earth  do not refuse to grant our prayer  may all these things come true  bring fame to nestor and his sons  and grant gifts to the pylians  as recompense for this fine sacrifice  and may the quest for which we sailed here in our swift black ship  succeed  and may we come home safe again   she made her prayer come true all by herself  she gave telemachus the splendid cup with double handle  and his prayer matched hers  and then they cooked the outer parts of meat  and helped themselves to pieces  sharing round the glorious feast  till they could eat no more  then first gerenian nestor  horse lord  spoke   now that our guests are satisfied with food  time now to talk to them and ask them questions   strangers  who are you  where did you sail from  are you on business  or just scouting round like pirates on the sea  who risk their lives to ravage foreign homes   telemachus was thoughtful but not shy  athena gave him the confidence deep in his heart to ask about his absent father  and to gain a noble reputation for himself   great nestor  son of neleus   he said   you ask where i am from  i will be frank   i come from ithaca  beneath mount neion  and i am here on private  family business  i came to gather news about my father  long suffering odysseus  they say he fought with you to sack the town of troy  we know the place where all the other men who battled with the trojans lost their lives  but zeus still keeps odysseus  fate in darkness  no one knows where he was lost  maybe some hostile men killed him on land   or he was drowned in amphitrite s waves  i beg you  tell me  did you see him die with your own eyes  or have you any news about where he may be  he must be lost  his mother surely bore him for misfortune  you need not sweeten what you say  in pity or from embarrassment  just tell me straight what your eyes saw of him  my noble father  if ever he made promises to you and kept his word at troy  in times of trouble   remember those times now  tell me the truth   gerenian nestor  horse lord  answered him   dear boy  you call to mind how much we suffered  with strong  unyielding hearts  in distant lands when we were sailing over misty seas  led by achilles on a hunt for spoils  and when we fought around the mighty city of priam  our best warriors were killed  ajax lies dead there  and there lies achilles  there lies his godlike friend and guide  patroclus   my own strong  matchless son lies dead there too  antilochus  who fought and ran so well  more pain  more grief our sufferings increased  who could recount so many  many losses  if you stayed here five years and kept on asking how many things the fighters suffered there  you would get bored and go back home again before the story ended  nine long years we schemed to bring them down  and finally zeus made our plots succeed  odysseus   your father  if you really are his son  well  no one dared to try to equal him in cleverness  that man was always best at every kind of trick  and seeing you  i am amazed at how you talk like him  one would not think so young a man could do it  well  back in troy  odysseus and i always agreed in councils  with one mind  we gave the argives all the best advice  after we conquered priam s lofty town   a god dispersed the ships of the achaeans  zeus planned a bitter journey home for us  since some of us had neither sense nor morals  gray eyed athena  daughter of the thunder  became enraged and brought about disaster  she set the sons of atreus to fight each other  hastily  they called the people at sunset  not observing proper norms  the men arrived already drunk on wine  the brothers told them why they called the meeting   then menelaus said that it was time to sail back home across the open sea  but agamemnon disagreed entirely  he wanted them to stay and sacrifice to heal the sickness of athena s wrath  pointless  he did not know she would not yield  the minds of the immortals rarely change  so those two stood and argued angrily  and with a dreadful clash of arms the greeks leapt up on two opposing sides  we slept  that eerie night with hearts intent on hatred against each other since zeus meant us harm  at dawn one group of us dragged down our ships into the sea piled high with loot and women  while half the army still remained there  stationed with agamemnon  shepherd of the people  my friends and i set sail with all good speed  a god had made the choppy sea lie calm  we came to tenedos and sacrificed  praying to get back home but zeus refused   the cruel god roused yet more strife among us  your father s plans were always flexible  his men turned round their prows and sailed right back to make their peace again with agamemnon  but i assembled all my fleet  and fled  i understood some god must mean us harm  then diomedes roused his men to come  and ruddy menelaus quickly sailed to meet with us on lesbos  and we pondered our long sea journey  should we travel north   go past the rocks of chios to our left  to psyria  or under chios  passing blustery mimas  so we prayed for signs  the god told us to cross the open sea towards euboea  to escape disaster  a fair wind whistled and our ships sped on across the journey ways of fish  and landed at nightfall in geraestus  to poseidon we offered many bulls  since we had crossed safely across wide waters  the fourth day  the men of diomedes moored their ships at argos  i kept going on  to pylos  the wind the god had sent kept holding strong the whole way home  so  my dear boy  i have no news about what happened next  i do not know which of them has died and who is safe  but i can tell you what i heard while sitting here in my halls  you ought to know  they say achilles  son led home the myrmidons  and philoctetes came back home with glory   and idomeneus led back his crew to crete  no man of his who had survived the war was lost at sea  and agamemnon  you must have heard  though you live far away  aegisthus murdered him  but he has paid a bitter price  how fortunate the dead man had left a son to take revenge upon the wicked  scheming killer  that aegisthus  who killed orestes  father  my dear boy  i see that you are tall and strong  be brave   so you will be remembered   thoughtfully telemachus replied   your majesty  king nestor  yes  orestes took revenge  the greeks will make him famous through the world and into future times  i wish the gods would grant me that much power against those men who threaten and insult me those cruel suitors  the gods have not yet granted us this blessing  my father and myself  we must endure   gerenian nestor  lord of horses  answered    dear boy  since you have brought the subject up  i have been told about your mother s suitors  how badly they are treating you at home  but do you willingly submit to it  or has a god s voice led the townspeople to hate you  well  who knows  perhaps one day he will come home and take revenge  alone  or with an army of the greeks  if only athena loved you  as she used to care for glorious odysseus at troy  when we were doing badly  i have never seen gods display such favor as she gave when she stood by your father  if she helped you with that much love  the suitors would forget their hopes for marriage   then telemachus replied   my lord  i doubt that this will happen  i am surprised you have such confidence  i would not be so hopeful  even if the gods were willing   then the goddess spoke   telemachus  what do you mean  a god  can easily save anyone  at will  no matter what the distance  i would rather suffer immensely  but then get home safe  than die on my return like agamemnon  murdered by his own wife  and by aegisthus  but death is universal  even gods cannot protect the people that they love  when fate and cruel death catch up with them   telemachus said apprehensively   mentor  this is upsetting  change the subject   he has no real chance now of getting home  the gods have fenced him round with death and darkness  let me ask nestor something else he is wiser and more informed than anyone  they say he ruled for three whole generations  he looks to me like some immortal god  so nestor  son of neleus  tell me truly  how did the great king agamemnon die  and where was menelaus  was he lost  away from greece  when that aegisthus dared  to kill a king  a better man than him  how did that wicked trickster s plot succeed   gerenian nestor  lord of horses  answered   i will tell everything though you can guess what would have happened if fair menelaus had found aegisthus living in his halls on his return  and even when he died  no one would bury him  he lay upon the open plain without a tomb and far from town for birds and dogs to eat  no greek  would mourn that monster  while we fought and labored at troy  this layabout sat safe in argos  seducing clytemnestra  noble wife of agamemnon  for a while  she scorned his foul suggestions  since her heart was good  moreover  when her husband went to troy  he left a poet  ordered to protect her  but finally fate forced the queen to yield  aegisthus left the poet to be eaten by birds  abandoned on a desert island   he led the woman back to his own house by mutual desire  and then he made numerous offerings on holy altars of animals and lovely gold and cloth  he had succeeded far beyond his hopes  and meanwhile  i left troy with menelaus  we sailed together  best of friends  we reached the holy cape of athens  sounion  there phoebus with his gentle arrows shot and killed the pilot  phrontis  as he held  the ship s helm as she sped along  no man knew better how to steer through any storm  so menelaus stopped to bury him with proper rites  at last he sailed again across the wine dark sea  but as his ships rushed round the craggy heights of malea  far seeing zeus sent curses on his journey  pouring out screaming winds and giant waves the size of mountains splitting up the fleet  some ships were hurled to crete  to river jardan   where the cydonian people have their homes  there steep rock rises sheer above the sea near gortyn in the misty deep  south winds drive mighty waves towards the left hand crag  and push them west to phaestus  one small rock restrains the massive currents  all the ships were smashed by waves against those rocks  the men were almost drowned  five other dark prowed ships were blown by wind and sea away to egypt  there menelaus gathered wealth and gold  and drifted with his ships through foreign lands  meanwhile at home  aegisthus had been plotting  he killed the son of atreus and seized control of rich mycenae  where he reigned for seven years  but in the eighth  orestes came to destroy him  he returned from athens  and killed his father s murderer  then called the argives to a funeral  a feast for clever  scheming  cowardly aegisthus whom he had killed  and his own hated mother   that very day  rambunctious menelaus arrived with all his ships crammed full of treasure  the moral is  you must not stay away too long  dear boy  when those proud suitors lurk inside your house  they may divide your wealth among themselves and make your journey useless  but i suggest you go to menelaus  he recently returned from lands so distant no one would even hope to get home safe once driven by the winds so far off course   over such dangerous  enormous seas  birds migrate there and take a year or more to travel back  go visit him by ship with your own crew  or if you would prefer  you can go there by land here is a carriage  my sons can guide you all the way to sparta  to menelaus  ask him for the truth  he will not lie  he is an honest man   the sun went down and darkness fell  the goddess  bright eyed athena  spoke to them   king nestor   your speech was good and your advice was sound  but now slice up the tongues and pour the wine for lord poseidon and the other gods before we rest time now to go to bed  the light is fading and it is not right to linger at a banquet in the dark   the people listened to athena

then sprinkled wine  then each man drank his fill  then zeus  daughter and the godlike boy both rose to go together to their ship  but nestor called to stop them   zeus forbids it  and all the other

have soft quilts and blankets in abundance  the darling son of great odysseus must not sleep on the ship s deck  while i live  not while my sons remain here in my house  ready to welcome anyone who

palace  but i must go back  to tell the crew the news and keep them strong  you see  i am the oldest in our party  the rest are younger men  close friends together  the same age as our brave

him a carriage  drawn by your strongest and most nimble horses    bright eyed athena flew away  transformed into an ossifrage  astonishment seized all the people watching  even nestor  he seized

gild her horns with gold to bless your journey   so he spoke  and pallas heard his prayer  gerenian nestor led them and led his sons and sons in law inside his own magnificent great hall  when they were all inside  he seated them on benches and on chairs arranged in order  and he himself mixed up the bowl for them  of sweet delicious wine  he had preserved it eleven years  the slave girl opened

What the sea god said they came to sparta, land of caves and valleys, and drove to menelaus  house. they found him hosting a wedding feast for many guests to celebrate his children s marriages. in troy he had declared that he would give his daughter to achilles  son, who ruled the myrmidons. now he was sending her, with dowry gifts of horse-drawn chariots; the gods had made the marriage come to pass. and he was welcoming a spartan bride,

Alector s daughter, for his well-loved son, strong megapenthes, mothered by a slave. the gods had given helen no more children after the beautiful hermione, image of aphrodite all in gold. neighbors and family were feasting gladly under the king s high roof. the bard was singing and strumming, and two acrobats were spinning and leading them in dance. telemachus and nestor s son stopped by the palace doors

And held their horses. menelaus  guard, eteoneus, ran out and saw them there, and then hurried back inside to tell his master.  your majesty, there are two men outside, strangers who seem like sons of zeus. please tell me, should we take off the harness from their horses? or send them off to find another host?  flushed menelaus shouted angrily,  you used to have some brains! now you are talking like a silly child.

We two were fed by many different hosts before returning home. as we may hope for zeus to keep us safe in future times, untack their horses! lead them in to dine!  so eteoneus rushed out from the palace, and ordered other slaves to follow him. they freed the sweating horses from their yoke and tied them by the manger, which they filled with emmer that they mixed with bright white barley. they leaned the carriage up against the wall

And led their guests inside the godlike house. the boys looked round the palace in amazement: the lofty halls of famous menelaus shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon. when they had satisfied their eyes with staring, they went to take a bath in polished tubs. the slave girls helped them wash and rubbed them down in olive oil, then dressed them in wool cloaks and tunics, and then seated them beside the son of atreus, king menelaus.

A house girl brought a basin made of silver, and water in a golden jug. she poured it over their hands to wash, then set a table of polished wood beside them, and a humble slave girl brought bread and many canap s, a lavish spread. the carver carried platters with every kind of meat, and set before them cups made of gold. then ruddy menelaus welcomed them both and told them,  help yourselves! enjoy the food! when you have shared our meal,

We will begin to ask you who you are. your fathers must be scepter-bearing kings; the sons of peasants do not look like you.  with that, he took the dish of rich roast meat, cut from the back, which was his special meal, and offered it to them. they reached their hands to take the food set out in front of them. after their thirst and hunger had been sated, telemachus turned round to nestor s son, ducking his head so no one else could hear.

 pisistratus! dear friend, do you see how these echoing halls are shining bright with bronze, and silver, gold and ivory and amber? it is as full of riches as the palace of zeus on mount olympus! i am struck with awe.  when menelaus heard his words, he spoke to them in turn his words flew out.  no mortal, my dear boys, can rival zeus. his halls and home and property are deathless. some man may match my wealth; or maybe not.

I suffered for it. i was lost, adrift at sea for eight long years. i traipsed through cyprus, phoenicia, egypt, ethiopia, sidon and araby, and libya, where lambs are born with horns their ewes give birth three times a year. the master and his slave have milk and cheese and meat; the flock provides sweet milk year round. but while i wandered there accumulating wealth, someone crept in and killed my brother; his own scheming wife

Betrayed him. i can take no joy in all my wealth. whoever they may be, your fathers have surely told you how much i have suffered! i lost my lovely home, and i was parted for many years from all my splendid riches. i wish i had stayed here, with just a third of all the treasure i have now acquired, if those who died at troy, so far away from argive pastures, were alive and well. i sit here in my palace, mourning all

Who died, and often weeping. sometimes tears bring comfort to my heart, but not for long; cold grief grows sickening. i miss them all, but one man most. when i remember him, i cannot eat or sleep, since no one labored like him odysseus. his destiny was suffering, and mine the endless pain of missing him. we do not even know if he is still alive he has been gone so long. his faithful wife and old laertes

Must grieve for him, and young telemachus, who was a newborn when he went away.  these words roused in the boy a desperate need to mourn his father. tears rolled down his face and splashed down on the ground. he lifted up his cloak to hide his eyes. but menelaus noticed and wondered whether he should wait until the boy first spoke about his father, or ask. as he was hesitating, helen emerged from her high-ceilinged, fragrant bedroom,

Like artemis, who carries golden arrows. adraste set a special chair for her, alcippe spread upon it soft wool blankets, and phylo brought a silver sewing basket, given to her by alcandre, the wife of polybus, who lived in thebes, in egypt, where people have extraordinary wealth. he gave two silver tubs to menelaus, a pair of tripods and ten pounds of gold. his wife gave other lovely gifts for helen:

A golden spindle and this silver basket on wheels; the rims were finished off with gold. phylo, her girl, brought out that basket now, packed full of yarn she had already spun. a spindle wound around with purple wool was laid across it. she sat down and put her feet upon a stool, and asked her husband,  do we know who these men are, menelaus, who have arrived here in our house? shall i conceal my thoughts or speak? i feel compelled

To say, the sight of them amazes me. i never saw two people so alike as this boy and telemachus, the son of spirited odysseus, the child he left behind, a little newborn baby, the day the greeks marched off to troy, their minds fixated on the war and violence. they made my face the cause that hounded them.  high-colored menelaus answered,  wife, i saw the likeness too. odysseus

Had hands like those, those legs, that hair, that head, that glancing gaze. and when i spoke just now about odysseus and all the things he suffered for my sake, the boy grimaced, and floods of tears were rolling down his cheeks; he raised his purple cloak to hide his eyes.  pisistratus, the son of nestor, spoke.  king menelaus, you are right. this is that warrior s true-born son, just as you said. but he is shy and feels he should not speak

Too boldly in your presence right away. your voice is like a god s to us. lord nestor sent me to guide him here. he longed to see you to get some news from you or some advice. a son whose father is away will suffer intensely, if he has no man at home to help him. in the absence of his father, telemachus has no one to protect him.  then menelaus answered,  so the son of my dear friend, who worked so hard for me,

Has come here to my house! i always thought that i would greet that friend with warmth beyond all other argives, if zeus let us sail home with all speed across the sea. i would have brought him from ithaca, with all his wealth, his son and people, and bestowed on him a town in argos, driving out the natives from somewhere hereabouts under my rule. we would have constantly spent time together. nothing would have divided us in love

And joy, till death s dark cloud surrounded us. but i suppose the god begrudged our friendship, and kept that poor, unlucky man from home.  his words made everybody want to cry. helen was weeping, as was menelaus. pisistratus  eyes were full of tears for irreplaceable antilochus, killed by the noble son of shining dawn. mindful of him, he spoke with words like wings.  king menelaus, when we spoke of you

Back home in our own halls, my father nestor always declared you are exceptional for common sense. so listen now to me. i disapprove of crying during dinner. dawn will soon come; weep then. there is no harm in mourning when a person dies; it is the only honor we can pay the dead  to cut our hair and drench our cheeks with tears. i had a brother named antilochus, one of the bravest fighters in the army,

A sprinter and a warrior. he died. i never got to meet him or to see him. perhaps you did?  king menelaus answered,  my friend, you speak just as a wise man should, like somebody much older than yourself. you show your father s wisdom in your speech. a lineage is easy to discern when zeus spins out a life of happiness, in marriage and in offspring. so he gave good luck to nestor all his life; he aged

At home in comfort, and his sons are wise and skillful spear-men. yes, we will stop crying and turn our minds to dinner once again. let them pour water on our hands. at dawn, telemachus and i can talk at length.  at that asphalion, the nimble house slave of mighty menelaus, poured the water over their hands. they helped themselves to food from laden tables. then the child of zeus, helen, decided she would mix the wine

With drugs to take all pain and rage away, to bring forgetfulness of every evil. whoever drinks this mixture from the bowl will shed no tears that day, not even if her mother or her father die, nor even if soldiers kill her brother or her darling son with bronze spears before her very eyes. helen had these powerful magic drugs from polydamna, wife of thon, from egypt, where fertile fields produce the most narcotics:

Some good, some dangerous. the people there are skillful doctors. they are the healer s people. she mixed the wine and told the slave to pour it, and then she spoke again.  now menelaus, and you two noble sons of noble men, zeus gives us good and bad at different times; he has the power. sit here then and eat, and i will entertain you with a story. enjoy it; it is fitting to the times. i cannot tell of all the challenges

Steadfast odysseus has undergone. but i will tell you what that brave man did at troy, when the achaeans were in trouble. he beat himself and bruised his body badly and put a ragged cloak on, like a slave, then shuffled through the enemy city streets. in his disguise he seemed a poor old beggar, hardly a man to sail with the achaeans. he crept through troy like that, and no one knew him except for me. i saw through his disguise

And questioned him. he was too smart to talk, acting evasive. but i washed and scrubbed him with oil and dressed him, and i swore an oath that i would not reveal him to the trojans before he had got back to his own camp. he told me all the things the greeks were planning. on his way back, he used his long bronze sword to slaughter many trojans, and he brought useful intelligence to tell the greeks. the trojan women keened in grief, but i

Was glad by then i wanted to go home. i wished that aphrodite had not made me go crazy, when she took me from my country, and made me leave my daughter and the bed i shared with my fine, handsome, clever husband.  and menelaus said,  yes, wife, quite right. i have been round the world, and i have met many heroic men and known their minds. i never saw a man so resolute as that odysseus. how tough he was!

And what impressive fortitude he showed inside the wooden horse! we fighters lurked inside, to bring destruction to the trojans. you came there too. some spirit who desired to glorify the trojans urged you on. godlike deiphobus was following you. three times you went around the hollow belly, touching the hiding place, and calling on us greeks by name; you put on different voices for each man s wife. then i and diomedes

And good odysseus, inside the horse, heard you call out to us, and we two wanted to go out, or to answer from in there. odysseus prevented us from going. then all the other sons of the achaeans were quiet; anticlus still wished to answer. odysseus  hands clamped shut his mouth and saved us all. he held him there like that, until athena led you far away.  weighing these words, telemachus replied,

 but menelaus, all this makes it worse! my father s courage could not save his life, even if he had had a heart of iron. so now, show us to bed. we need the comfort of being lulled into a sweet deep sleep.  then argive helen told her girls to spread beds on the porch and pile on them fine rugs of purple, and lay blankets over them, with woolly covers on the very top. the girls went out with torches in their hands

And made the beds. a slave led out the guests. telemachus and nestor s handsome son slept in the front room; menelaus slept far back inside the lofty house. beside him lay marvelous helen, in her flowing gown. soon dawn was born, her fingers bright with roses. gruff menelaus jumped up out of bed, got dressed and strapped his sharp sword to his shoulder, then tied his sandals on his well-oiled feet. he went out of his bedroom like a god,

Approached telemachus, and spoke to him.  what need has brought you here, telemachus, to sparta, over such expanse of sea? private or public business? tell me truly!  telemachus inhaled and then replied,  king menelaus, son of atreus, i came in search of news about my father. my house is being eaten up; our wealth is ruined. my whole home is full of men who mean me harm my mother s loutish suitors.

Each day they kill more sheep, more longhorn cattle. so i am begging you, here on my knees, tell me the dreadful news, if he is dead! perhaps you saw it with your eyes, or heard tales of his travels. he was surely born to suffer in extraordinary ways. please do not try to sweeten bitter news from pity; tell me truly if you saw him, and how he was. if my heroic father ever helped you at troy when things were bad,

Keep that in mind right now, and tell the truth.  flushed, menelaus shouted out in anger,  damn them! those cowards want to steal the bed of one whose heart is braver than their own. as when a deer lays down two newborn fawns, still sucklings, in the lair of some strong lion, and goes to look for pasture, over slopes and grassy valleys; when the lion comes back to his own bed, he brings down doom on them  so will odysseus upon those men.

O father zeus, athena, and apollo, i pray he is as strong as when he stood to wrestle philomeleides, on lesbos, and hurled him to the ground, and we all cheered. so may odysseus attack the suitors. may all their lives be brief, their weddings cursed! as for your questions, i will not deceive you. i will not hide a single word i heard from that old sea god proteus. although i longed to come back home, away from egypt,

The gods prevented me, since i had failed to offer perfect hecatombs. they always desire obedience. there is an island out in the sea beside the coast of egypt, named pharos. if a clear wind blows your ship, it takes all day to travel to that island. its harbor has good anchorage, and there men draw dark water up, and then launch off to sea. but i was held for twenty days by gods. no winds appeared to guide my ships

Across the water s back. all our supplies would have been gone, and all our hope; but then a goddess, eidothea, pitied me  the child of proteus, the old sea god. she met me pacing sadly all alone. my men were off around the island, fishing with hooks, as usual hunger pinched their bellies. she stood beside me and she spoke to me.  stranger, are you so foolish that you choose to give up, and take pleasure in your pain?

There is no end in sight; you have been stuck here on this island for so long. your men grow weak at heart.  i answered her and said,  whoever you may be for sure a goddess  i tell you i am trapped against my will. i must have sinned against the deathless gods who live in heaven. please explain which spirit is blocking me from going home across the teeming sea. gods must know everything.  that shining goddess answered me at once,

 stranger, i will be frank with you. a deathless old sea god haunts this place, named proteus of egypt, who can speak infallibly, who knows the depths of seas, and serves poseidon. they say he is the one who fathered me. if you can somehow lie in wait and catch him, he will explain how you can get back home, plotting your path where fish leap through the waters. and if you wish it, prince, he will explain what happened in your home, both good and bad,

While you were gone on this long, painful journey.  those were her words. i answered,  tell me, please, how i can trap this ancient god, so he will not see me too soon, and get away. it is not easy for a man to catch a god.  the goddess answered me at once,  stranger, i will instruct you thoroughly. when the sun hits the midpoint of the sky, the old god bobs above the salty water; the breath of zephyr hides him in dark shade.

He goes to take his nap inside the caves. around him sleep the clustering seals, the daughters of lovely lady brine. their breath smells sour from gray seawater, pungent salty depths. select the three best men you have on board, and when dawn breaks, i will take all of you down to the shore, and set you in a line. let me explain the old god s tricks. he will first count the seals and walk around among them. when he has counted them and checked them all,

He lies down in the middle, like a shepherd among his flock of sheep. when you observe him sleeping, gather all your force and strength, and hold him there, despite his desperate struggles. in trying to escape, he will change shape to every animal on earth, and then water and holy fire. you must hold fast unshaken, and press harder; keep him down. at last he will assume again the form in which he went to sleep, and he will speak

And question you. then, warrior, release your forceful hold on that old god, and ask him which god is angry with you, and the way to cross the fish-filled waters and go home.  with that she sank beneath the deep sea waves. i went down to the ships upon the sand. my heart was surging in me as i walked. arriving at the ships and at the shore, we made our meal. then came immortal night; we went to sleep beside the water s edge.

When dawn appeared, her fingers bright with flowers, i walked beside the spreading sea, along the dunes, and prayed intensely to the gods. then i chose out my three most trusted men. the goddess dove down deep inside the sea and brought four sealskins up from underwater, new-flayed to help her plot against her father. she scooped out hiding places in the sand, and sat to wait. we came right up to her. she laid us in a row, and put a skin

On each. it would have been a dismal hideout, stinking of salt-bred seals. who would lie down to rest beside a creature from the sea? but she brought sweet ambrosia to save us. she very kindly put it in our nostrils, to take away the stench of seal. we waited all morning, apprehensively. and then out of the sea there rose a pod of seals; they lay along the shore. at noon the god emerged above the waves. he went among

His fatted seals and counted out their number. he counted us among the first of them, suspecting nothing. then he lay down too. with a great shout we pounced on him and grabbed him. the old god still remembered all his tricks, and first became a lion with a mane, then snake, then leopard, then a mighty boar, then flowing water, then a leafy tree. but we kept holding on: our hearts stood firm. at last that ancient sorcerer grew tired,

And then he asked me,  son of atreus! what god devised this plan with you and taught you to lurk and capture me against my will? what do you want from me?  and i replied,  old god, why do you want to throw me off? you know i have been trapped here on this island for far too long, with no way out; my heart grows faint. so tell me gods know everything  what spirit stops my journey? and how can i get home across the watery shoals of fish? 

At once he answered me and told me this:  you should have given zeus and other gods fine offerings, to speed your journey home across the wine-dark sea. it is your fate not to go home or see the ones you love until you go again to egypt s river, watered by zeus, and kill a hundred cows, to please the deathless gods who live in heaven. then they will let you travel where you wish.  i felt heartbroken that i had to cross

The misty sea and go again to egypt: a long and bitter journey! but i answered,  sir, i will do exactly as you say. but come now, tell me this, and tell me truly, did all the greeks sail safely home by ship, whom nestor and myself left there in troy? did any meet a dreadful death at sea, on his own ship, or in familiar arms, after the war wound up?  when i said this, at once he answered me and said these words.

 o son of atreus! why ask me this? you have no need to know or learn my mind. when i have told you, you will not be long able to hold back tears. so many men were killed, and many left behind at troy. just two of all the bronze-clad captains died while traveling back home; one more perhaps may be alive, trapped somewhere out at sea. ajax was drowned; his ships were sunk. poseidon first drove him to the rocks of gyrae, then

Rescued him from the sea; he would have lived, despite athena s hatred, but he made a crazy boast that he survived the waves against the wishes of the gods. poseidon heard his rash words. at once, he seized his trident in mighty hands, and hit the gyran rock. one half remained; the other, on which ajax sat as he boasted, cracked right off and fell into the sea, and carried him deep down. the boundless waves washed over him; he drank

The salty brine, and died. but agamemnon survived the goddess hera saved his fleet. when he had almost reached the craggy mountain of malea, a gust of wind took hold and bore him over waves where fish were jumping, across the rumbling depths to where all farms are finished, where thyestes used to live, and now his son aegisthus. after that, the route was clear: the gods made all winds fair. then joyfully he stepped foot in his country,

And touched and kissed the earth of his dear home. he wept hot floods of tears, from happiness. but from the lookout post the watchman saw him. scheming aegisthus paid that man two talents of gold to watch all year, so agamemnon could not slip past unseen, or summon up his will to fight. the spy rushed off to tell the king. aegisthus formed a plan at once. he chose the twenty best men in the land to lurk in ambush, and he told the house slaves

To cook a feast. he rode out on his carriage, and summoned agamemnon, who suspected nothing. aegisthus killed him over dinner, just as a person kills an ox at manger. all of the men who came with him were killed, and all those of aegisthus; all were killed.  his story broke my heart, and i sat down upon the sands and wept. i did not want to go on living or to see the sun. i thrashed around and wailed. when i was done,

The old sea god spoke words of truth to me.  now, son of atreus, your endless weeping has gone on long enough. it does no good. quickly, go home. you may still find aegisthus alive, or else orestes may have come and killed him; you can join his funeral.  those words made me a man again: my heart was warmed inside, despite my grief. my words took wings. i said,  i know now of those two; but name the third who may be still alive,

Trapped somewhere in the wide expanse of sea, or may be dead. i know the news may hurt, but still i want to hear it.  and he answered,  it is laertes  son, the ithacan. i saw him crying, shedding floods of tears upon calypso s island, in her chambers. she traps him there; he cannot go back home. he has no boats with oars or crew to row him across the sea s broad back to his own land. but menelaus, it is not your fate

To die in argos. gods will carry you off to the world s end, to elysium. those fields are ruled by tawny rhadamanthus and life is there the easiest for humans. there is no snow, no heavy storms or rain, but ocean always sends up gentle breezes of zephyr to refresh the people there. you gain these blessings as the son-in-law of zeus through helen.  then the old god sank beneath the waves. i went back to my ships

And godlike men, and as i walked my mind swirled with my many thoughts. beside the fleet we cooked and ate our meal, then holy night came down; we slept beside the surging water. when early dawn appeared and touched the sky with blossom, first we launched the balanced ships into the salty sea, put up the masts and fixed the sails, and then the men embarked and sat on benches neatly, in their lines. and then at once they struck the sea with oars.

We soon reached egypt s holy rain-fed river. we docked the ships and sacrificed the oxen. when i had quenched the anger of the gods, i built a mound to honor agamemnon, for his immortal fame. the gods at last gave me fair wind, and sent me quickly home. but come now, stay with me here in my palace, until eleven days or twelve have passed. then i will send you off with precious gifts, three horses and a gleaming chariot.

Also a lovely cup so you can pour gifts to the gods, and always think of me.  then tactfully telemachus replied,  please do not keep me here so long, my lord. indeed, i would be glad to stay a year; i would not even miss my home or parents  i get such pleasure listening to you. but my poor friends are surely tired of waiting in pylos. you have made me stay too long. and for a gift, please only give me treasure.

You keep your lovely horses here; i cannot transport them all the way to ithaca. you rule these open meadows, rich in clover, white barley in wide rows, and wheat and grass. in ithaca, there are no fields or racetracks. though it is only fit for goats, we love it more than horse pasture. islands out at sea have no good grazing ours the least of all.  then menelaus smiled and clasped his hand, and spoke to him in his loud booming voice.

 my boy, your words are proof of your good blood. i will give different gifts, just as you ask. i will give you the finest piece of treasure of all the hoard i have piled up at home: a finely crafted bowl, of purest silver, with gold around the rim. hephaestus made it, and phaedimus the king of sidon gave it to me, when i was visiting his house as i was traveling home. you can have that.  such was their conversation. then the guests

Entered the palace, bringing lamb and wine that gives one confidence. the girls, all dressed in pretty scarves, brought bread for them. so went the feasting in the house of menelaus. meanwhile, outside odysseus  house, the suitors were as arrogant as usual, enjoying throwing discuses and spears out on the playing field. the two chief suitors, were sitting there: antinous and godlike eurymachus. just then no mon, son

Of phronius, approached and asked a question.  so do we know, antinous, or not, whether telemachus is coming back from sandy pylos? he left with my ship. i need it, to cross over to the fields of elis, where i have twelve mares with mules suckling their teats and not yet broken in. i want to take and train one.  they were all astonished, since they had not thought the boy was gone to pylos, but was somewhere near,

Out with the sheep or pigs. antinous said,  tell me true, when did he go? and who went with him? did he choose some ithacans, or slaves and laborers? it could be either. and tell me also, did he steal the ship from you by force, or did you give it to him freely, because he asked?  no mon, son of phronius, replied,  i gave it freely. what could i do, when someone so upset was asking me? a noble boy like that?

It would have been ungracious to refuse. the young men who were with him were high class, the best in town except ourselves. i saw mentor embark as captain or perhaps not mentor but a god who looked like him. this puzzles me, that yesterday at dawn i saw great mentor here, though he had gone to pylos in the ship.  with that, no mon departed for his father s house. those leaders were furious. at once they made the suitors

Stop playing games and sit. antinous spoke up with eyes bright as fire, his mind darkened with anger.  damn! that stuck-up boy succeeded in his stupid trip. we thought he would not manage it. telemachus has launched a ship and picked an ideal crew, despite us all! this is the start of worse. may zeus destroy his strength before he reaches manhood. give me a ship and twenty men, so i may watch and catch him in the strait

In between ithaca and craggy same. a sad end to this journey for his father!  all of them praised his words, endorsed his plan, and went inside odysseus  palace. penelope was soon aware of all the suitors  secret plots. the house boy medon told her, since he had been outside the courtyard and he had heard the plans they were devising. he rushed to tell her. as he stepped inside, across the threshold, she came up and asked him,

 well, boy, why have those lordly suitors sent you? to tell godlike odysseus  girls to stop their work and make a feast for them? i hope this is their final meal! i hope they never gather elsewhere to go courting! you suitors who come crowding here are wasting telemachus  wealth! when you were younger you never paid attention to your fathers who told you of odysseus  greatness. he never spoke or acted without justice,

Among the people. lords are mostly biased; they favor one person and hate another. but he did not. he did no wrong at all. now you! your wicked deeds and plans are clear. no gratitude for favors from the past!  then knowledgeable medon answered her,  my queen, i wish this were the worst of it. now they are plotting even greater ruin. may zeus ensure it never comes to pass! the suitors want to kill telemachus

With sharp bronze weapons on his journey home. he went to sandy pylos and to sparta for word about his father.  at the news, her legs grew weak; her heart sank; she was struck dumb for a time, her voice blocked as her eyes filled up with tears. at last she answered him,  but why did my son go away? there was no need to go on those swift ships that gallop like horses over miles of salty water. did he intend to lose his name as well,

And be unknown?  and medon said,  perhaps some god or his own heart nudged him to go to pylos to find out about his father, if he will come back home, or if he has already met his fate.  with that, he left her. grief wrapped around her, eating at her heart. the house was full of chairs but she could not bear to sit upright. in her bedroom doorway, collapsing on the floor, she wept and cried. around her all her women, young and old,

Were whimpering. voice thick with tears, she sobbed,  friends, listen! zeus has cursed me more than all the women of my family. already i lost my noble, lionhearted husband, most talented and brave of all the greeks, whose fame is spread through greece. and now the winds have taken my dear son, and no one told me that he was setting out. shame on you all! you knew that he was leaving in that ship! not one of you came here to wake me up!

If only i had known about his journey, he would have stayed no matter how he wanted to leave or else have left me dead right here. now call old dolius, my gardener, the slave who cares for all my trees. my father gave him to me when i came here. tell him to hurry off and sit beside laertes, and tell him everything; he may decide to go in tears to plead with those who want to kill godlike odysseus  son,

His grandson.  then the loyal eurycleia said,  lady, sweetheart, even if you take a sword and kill me, i will tell the truth. i knew all this. i gave him what he asked for, bread and sweet wine. he made me swear an oath not to inform you, till twelve days had passed, or till you heard about it, and you missed him, so that you would not cry and spoil your beauty. now have a bath, get changed into clean clothes, go with your slave girls upstairs to your room.

Pray to athena, child of zeus the king. she may save him from death. and do not bother poor old laertes; he has pain enough. i do not think the blessed gods despise this family; i trust that there will always be one to rule this house and rich estate.  this soothed penelope. she dried her tears, and took her bath and got dressed in clean clothes, then went up to her bedroom with her girls. she put some barley on a tray and prayed.

 hear me, athena, tireless child of zeus, if my quick-minded husband ever gave you fat thighs of beef or lamb here in our halls, remember now and save the son i love. protect him from the abuses of those suitors!  she wailed aloud; the goddess heard her prayer. the suitors made a racket that resounded all through the palace shadows. they were boasting,  this queen whom all of us have come here courting is ready now to marry one of us,

And does not even know her son will die!  they spoke not knowing how things really stood. antinous declared to them,  my lords, you have to stop this bragging! quiet down, or those inside will hear it. now get up in silence. we must go and follow through the plan we all agreed on in our hearts.  with that, he picked the twenty strongest men. they went down to the seashore; first of all they launched the swift black ship in deep saltwater,

Set up the mast and raised the sails and fit the oars in proper order in the straps of leather, then spread out the bright white sails. with confidence their slaves dealt out the weapons. they moored high up the stream and disembarked. they ate there, while they waited for the evening. penelope lay upstairs in her bedroom, refusing food and drink, consuming nothing. she wondered if her fine son would escape from death, or be brought down by those proud suitors.

Her mind was like a lion, caught by humans, when they are clustering round him in a circle, trying to trap him; so sweet drowsiness subdued her and she slept, her limbs relaxed. athena, bright-eyed goddess, had a plan. she made a phantom looking like a woman, iphthime, child of great icarius, the wife of eumelus who lived in pherae. she sent it to odysseus  house, to make penelope feel less distressed

And stop her tears of grief. it traveled through the latch s thong, and in her bedroom stood above her head, and asked,  penelope, are you asleep? and are you still upset? the gods who live at ease have no desire for you to weep or worry. know, your son is coming home. he has not wronged the gods.  intelligent penelope, still sleeping sweetly inside the gates of dreams, replied,  sister, why have you come? your house is far,

And you have never visited before. you tell me to stop grieving and not feel the many pains that prickle at my heart. but long ago i lost my lionhearted husband, a man more talented than any, famous throughout all greece. now my dear son has sailed off in a ship, though he knows nothing of hardship and the world; he is a child. i worry for him more than for his father. i shudder, i am scared of what may happen,

At sea, or in the country that he went to. he has so many enemies; they plan to murder him before he reaches home.  the misty phantom answered her,  have courage. let not your heart be troubled or afraid. he has a goddess as his guide athena, a helper many men have prayed to have. she has great power. pitying your grief, she sent me here to tell you all of this.  careful penelope replied,  if you

Are actually a god, with news from gods, tell me about my husband too, poor man! tell if he is alive and sees the sun, or dead already in the house of hades!  the spirit said,  i cannot tell you whether he is alive or dead. it is not good to speak of things intangible as wind.  with that, the phantom floated through the air into the breeze. and then penelope woke up from sleep, and she was glad at heart,

Because she dreamed so clearly in the night. the suitors got on board and sailed across the water, set on murdering the boy. there is a rocky island out at sea, in between ithaca and craggy same, called asteris quite small but with a harbor to shelter ships, and there they lurked in ambush.",what the sea god said they came to sparta  land of caves and valleys  and drove to menelaus  house  they found him hosting a wedding feast for many guests to celebrate his children s marriages  in troy he had declared that he would give his daughter to achilles  son  who ruled the myrmidons  now he was sending her  with dowry gifts of horse drawn chariots  the gods had made the marriage come to pass  and he was welcoming a spartan bride   alector s daughter  for his well loved son  strong megapenthes  mothered by a slave  the gods had given helen no more children after the beautiful hermione  image of aphrodite all in gold  neighbors and family were feasting gladly under the king s high roof  the bard was singing and strumming  and two acrobats were spinning and leading them in dance  telemachus and nestor s son stopped by the palace doors  and held their horses  menelaus  guard  eteoneus  ran out and saw them there  and then hurried back inside to tell his master   your majesty  there are two men outside  strangers who seem like sons of zeus  please tell me  should we take off the harness from their horses  or send them off to find another host   flushed menelaus shouted angrily   you used to have some brains  now you are talking like a silly child   we two were fed by many different hosts before returning home  as we may hope for zeus to keep us safe in future times  untack their horses  lead them in to dine   so eteoneus rushed out from the palace  and ordered other slaves to follow him  they freed the sweating horses from their yoke and tied them by the manger  which they filled with emmer that they mixed with bright white barley  they leaned the carriage up against the wall  and led their guests inside the godlike house  the boys looked round the palace in amazement  the lofty halls of famous menelaus shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon  when they had satisfied their eyes with staring  they went to take a bath in polished tubs  the slave girls helped them wash and rubbed them down in olive oil  then dressed them in wool cloaks and tunics  and then seated them beside the son of atreus  king menelaus   a house girl brought a basin made of silver  and water in a golden jug  she poured it over their hands to wash  then set a table of polished wood beside them  and a humble slave girl brought bread and many canap s  a lavish spread  the carver carried platters with every kind of meat  and set before them cups made of gold  then ruddy menelaus welcomed them both and told them   help yourselves  enjoy the food  when you have shared our meal   we will begin to ask you who you are  your fathers must be scepter bearing kings  the sons of peasants do not look like you   with that  he took the dish of rich roast meat  cut from the back  which was his special meal  and offered it to them  they reached their hands to take the food set out in front of them  after their thirst and hunger had been sated  telemachus turned round to nestor s son  ducking his head so no one else could hear    pisistratus  dear friend  do you see how these echoing halls are shining bright with bronze  and silver  gold and ivory and amber  it is as full of riches as the palace of zeus on mount olympus  i am struck with awe   when menelaus heard his words  he spoke to them in turn his words flew out   no mortal  my dear boys  can rival zeus  his halls and home and property are deathless  some man may match my wealth  or maybe not   i suffered for it  i was lost  adrift at sea for eight long years  i traipsed through cyprus  phoenicia  egypt  ethiopia  sidon and araby  and libya  where lambs are born with horns their ewes give birth three times a year  the master and his slave have milk and cheese and meat  the flock provides sweet milk year round  but while i wandered there accumulating wealth  someone crept in and killed my brother  his own scheming wife  betrayed him  i can take no joy in all my wealth  whoever they may be  your fathers have surely told you how much i have suffered  i lost my lovely home  and i was parted for many years from all my splendid riches  i wish i had stayed here  with just a third of all the treasure i have now acquired  if those who died at troy  so far away from argive pastures  were alive and well  i sit here in my palace  mourning all  who died  and often weeping  sometimes tears bring comfort to my heart  but not for long  cold grief grows sickening  i miss them all  but one man most  when i remember him  i cannot eat or sleep  since no one labored like him odysseus  his destiny was suffering  and mine the endless pain of missing him  we do not even know if he is still alive he has been gone so long  his faithful wife and old laertes  must grieve for him  and young telemachus  who was a newborn when he went away   these words roused in the boy a desperate need to mourn his father  tears rolled down his face and splashed down on the ground  he lifted up his cloak to hide his eyes  but menelaus noticed and wondered whether he should wait until the boy first spoke about his father  or ask  as he was hesitating  helen emerged from her high ceilinged  fragrant bedroom   like artemis  who carries golden arrows  adraste set a special chair for her  alcippe spread upon it soft wool blankets  and phylo brought a silver sewing basket  given to her by alcandre  the wife of polybus  who lived in thebes  in egypt  where people have extraordinary wealth  he gave two silver tubs to menelaus  a pair of tripods and ten pounds of gold  his wife gave other lovely gifts for helen   a golden spindle and this silver basket on wheels  the rims were finished off with gold  phylo  her girl  brought out that basket now  packed full of yarn she had already spun  a spindle wound around with purple wool was laid across it  she sat down and put her feet upon a stool  and asked her husband   do we know who these men are  menelaus  who have arrived here in our house  shall i conceal my thoughts or speak  i feel compelled  to say  the sight of them amazes me  i never saw two people so alike as this boy and telemachus  the son of spirited odysseus  the child he left behind  a little newborn baby  the day the greeks marched off to troy  their minds fixated on the war and violence  they made my face the because that hounded them   high colored menelaus answered   wife  i saw the likeness too  odysseus  had hands like those  those legs  that hair  that head  that glancing gaze  and when i spoke just now about odysseus and all the things he suffered for my sake  the boy grimaced  and floods of tears were rolling down his cheeks  he raised his purple cloak to hide his eyes   pisistratus  the son of nestor  spoke   king menelaus  you are right  this is that warrior s true born son  just as you said  but he is shy and feels he should not speak  too boldly in your presence right away  your voice is like a god s to us  lord nestor sent me to guide him here  he longed to see you to get some news from you or some advice  a son whose father is away will suffer intensely  if he has no man at home to help him  in the absence of his father  telemachus has no one to protect him   then menelaus answered   so the son of my dear friend  who worked so hard for me   has come here to my house  i always thought that i would greet that friend with warmth beyond all other argives  if zeus let us sail home with all speed across the sea  i would have brought him from ithaca  with all his wealth  his son and people  and bestowed on him a town in argos  driving out the natives from somewhere hereabouts under my rule  we would have constantly spent time together  nothing would have divided us in love  and joy  till death s dark cloud surrounded us  but i suppose the god begrudged our friendship  and kept that poor  unlucky man from home   his words made everybody want to cry  helen was weeping  as was menelaus  pisistratus  eyes were full of tears for irreplaceable antilochus  killed by the noble son of shining dawn  mindful of him  he spoke with words like wings   king menelaus  when we spoke of you  back home in our own halls  my father nestor always declared you are exceptional for common sense  so listen now to me  i disapprove of crying during dinner  dawn will soon come  weep then  there is no harm in mourning when a person dies  it is the only honor we can pay the dead  to cut our hair and drench our cheeks with tears  i had a brother named antilochus  one of the bravest fighters in the army   a sprinter and a warrior  he died  i never got to meet him or to see him  perhaps you did   king menelaus answered   my friend  you speak just as a wise man should  like somebody much older than yourself  you show your father s wisdom in your speech  a lineage is easy to discern when zeus spins out a life of happiness  in marriage and in offspring  so he gave good luck to nestor all his life  he aged  at home in comfort  and his sons are wise and skillful spear men  yes  we will stop crying and turn our minds to dinner once again  let them pour water on our hands  at dawn  telemachus and i can talk at length   at that asphalion  the nimble house slave of mighty menelaus  poured the water over their hands  they helped themselves to food from laden tables  then the child of zeus  helen  decided she would mix the wine  with drugs to take all pain and rage away  to bring forgetfulness of every evil  whoever drinks this mixture from the bowl will she would no tears that day  not even if her mother or her father die  nor even if soldiers kill her brother or her darling son with bronze spears before her very eyes  helen had these powerful magic drugs from polydamna  wife of thon  from egypt  where fertile fields produce the most narcotics   some good  some dangerous  the people there are skillful doctors  they are the healer s people  she mixed the wine and told the slave to pour it  and then she spoke again   now menelaus  and you two noble sons of noble men  zeus gives us good and bad at different times  he has the power  sit here then and eat  and i will entertain you with a story  enjoy it  it is fitting to the times  i cannot tell of all the challenges  steadfast odysseus has undergone  but i will tell you what that brave man did at troy  when the achaeans were in trouble  he beat himself and bruised his body badly and put a ragged cloak on  like a slave  then shuffled through the enemy city streets  in his disguise he seemed a poor old beggar  hardly a man to sail with the achaeans  he crept through troy like that  and no one knew him except for me  i saw through his disguise  and questioned him  he was too smart to talk  acting evasive  but i washed and scrubbed him with oil and dressed him  and i swore an oath that i would not reveal him to the trojans before he had got back to his own camp  he told me all the things the greeks were planning  on his way back  he used his long bronze sword to slaughter many trojans  and he brought useful intelligence to tell the greeks  the trojan women keened in grief  but i  was glad by then i wanted to go home  i wished that aphrodite had not made me go crazy  when she took me from my country  and made me leave my daughter and the bed i shared with my fine  handsome  clever husband   and menelaus said   yes  wife  quite right  i have been round the world  and i have met many heroic men and known their minds  i never saw a man so resolute as that odysseus  how tough he was   and what impressive fortitude he showed inside the wooden horse  we fighters lurked inside  to bring destruction to the trojans  you came there too  some spirit who desired to glorify the trojans urged you on  godlike deiphobus was following you  three times you went around the hollow belly  touching the hiding place  and calling on us greeks by name  you put on different voices for each man s wife  then i and diomedes  and good odysseus  inside the horse  heard you call out to us  and we two wanted to go out  or to answer from in there  odysseus prevented us from going  then all the other sons of the achaeans were quiet  anticlus still wished to answer  odysseus  hands clamped shut his mouth and saved us all  he held him there like that  until athena led you far away   weighing these words  telemachus replied    but menelaus  all this makes it worse  my father s courage could not save his life  even if he had had a heart of iron  so now  show us to bed  we need the comfort of being lulled into a sweet deep sleep   then argive helen told her girls to spread beds on the porch and pile on them fine rugs of purple  and lay blankets over them  with woolly covers on the very top  the girls went out with torches in their hands  and made the beds  a slave led out the guests  telemachus and nestor s handsome son slept in the front room  menelaus slept far back inside the lofty house  beside him lay marvelous helen  in her flowing gown  soon dawn was born  her fingers bright with roses  gruff menelaus jumped up out of bed  got dressed and strapped his sharp sword to his shoulder  then tied his sandals on his well oiled feet  he went out of his bedroom like a god   approached telemachus  and spoke to him   what need has brought you here  telemachus  to sparta  over such expanse of sea  private or public business  tell me truly   telemachus inhaled and then replied   king menelaus  son of atreus  i came in search of news about my father  my house is being eaten up  our wealth is ruined  my whole home is full of men who mean me harm my mother s loutish suitors   each day they kill more sheep  more longhorn cattle  so i am begging you  here on my knees  tell me the dreadful news  if he is dead  perhaps you saw it with your eyes  or heard tales of his travels  he was surely born to suffer in extraordinary ways  please do not try to sweeten bitter news from pity  tell me truly if you saw him  and how he was  if my heroic father ever helped you at troy when things were bad   keep that in mind right now  and tell the truth   flushed  menelaus shouted out in anger   damn them  those cowards want to steal the bed of one whose heart is braver than their own  as when a deer lays down two newborn fawns  still sucklings  in the lair of some strong lion  and goes to look for pasture  over slopes and grassy valleys  when the lion comes back to his own bed  he brings down doom on them  so will odysseus upon those men   o father zeus  athena  and apollo  i pray he is as strong as when he stood to wrestle philomeleides  on lesbos  and hurled him to the ground  and we all cheered  so may odysseus attack the suitors  may all their lives be brief  their weddings cursed  as for your questions  i will not deceive you  i will not hide a single word i heard from that old sea god proteus  although i longed to come back home  away from egypt   the gods prevented me  since i had failed to offer perfect hecatombs  they always desire obedience  there is an island out in the sea beside the coast of egypt  named pharos  if a clear wind blows your ship  it takes all day to travel to that island  its harbor has good anchorage  and there men draw dark water up  and then launch off to sea  but i was held for twenty days by gods  no winds appeared to guide my ships  across the water s back  all our supplies would have been gone  and all our hope  but then a goddess  eidothea  pitied me  the child of proteus  the old sea god  she met me pacing sadly all alone  my men were off around the island  fishing with hooks  as usual hunger pinched their bellies  she stood beside me and she spoke to me   stranger  are you so foolish that you choose to give up  and take pleasure in your pain   there is no end in sight  you have been stuck here on this island for so long  your men grow weak at heart   i answered her and said   whoever you may be for sure a goddess  i tell you i am trapped against my will  i must have sinned against the deathless gods who live in heaven  please explain which spirit is blocking me from going home across the teeming sea  gods must know everything   that shining goddess answered me at once    stranger  i will be frank with you  a deathless old sea god haunts this place  named proteus of egypt  who can speak infallibly  who knows the depths of seas  and serves poseidon  they say he is the one who fathered me  if you can somehow lie in wait and catch him  he will explain how you can get back home  plotting your path where fish leap through the waters  and if you wish it  prince  he will explain what happened in your home  both good and bad   while you were gone on this long  painful journey   those were her words  i answered   tell me  please  how i can trap this ancient god  so he will not see me too soon  and get away  it is not easy for a man to catch a god   the goddess answered me at once   stranger  i will instruct you thoroughly  when the sun hits the midpoint of the sky  the old god bobs above the salty water  the breath of zephyr hides him in dark shade   he goes to take his nap inside the caves  around him sleep the clustering seals  the daughters of lovely lady brine  their breath smells sour from gray seawater  pungent salty depths  select the three best men you have on board  and when dawn breaks  i will take all of you down to the shore  and set you in a line  let me explain the old god s tricks  he will first count the seals and walk around among them  when he has counted them and checked them all   he lies down in the middle  like a shepherd among his flock of sheep  when you observe him sleeping  gather all your force and strength  and hold him there  despite his desperate struggles  in trying to escape  he will change shape to every animal on earth  and then water and holy fire  you must hold fast unshaken  and press harder  keep him down  at last he will assume again the form in which he went to sleep  and he will speak  and question you  then  warrior  release your forceful hold on that old god  and ask him which god is angry with you  and the way to cross the fish filled waters and go home   with that she sank beneath the deep sea waves  i went down to the ships upon the sand  my heart was surging in me as i walked  arriving at the ships and at the shore  we made our meal  then came immortal night  we went to sleep beside the water s edge   when dawn appeared  her fingers bright with flowers  i walked beside the spreading sea  along the dunes  and prayed intensely to the gods  then i chose out my three most trusted men  the goddess dove down deep inside the sea and brought four sealskins up from underwater  new flayed to help her plot against her father  she scooped out hiding places in the sand  and sat to wait  we came right up to her  she laid us in a row  and put a skin  on each  it would have been a dismal hideout  stinking of salt bred seals  who would lie down to rest beside a creature from the sea  but she brought sweet ambrosia to save us  she very kindly put it in our nostrils  to take away the stench of seal  we waited all morning  apprehensively  and then out of the sea there rose a pod of seals  they lay along the shore  at noon the god emerged above the waves  he went among  his fatted seals and counted out their number  he counted us among the first of them  suspecting nothing  then he lay down too  with a great shout we pounced on him and grabbed him  the old god still remembered all his tricks  and first became a lion with a mane  then snake  then leopard  then a mighty boar  then flowing water  then a leafy tree  but we kept holding on  our hearts stood firm  at last that ancient sorcerer grew tired   and then he asked me   son of atreus  what god devised this plan with you and taught you to lurk and capture me against my will  what do you want from me   and i replied   old god  why do you want to throw me off  you know i have been trapped here on this island for far too long  with no way out  my heart grows faint  so tell me gods know everything  what spirit stops my journey  and how can i get home across the watery shoals of fish    at once he answered me and told me this   you should have given zeus and other gods fine offerings  to speed your journey home across the wine dark sea  it is your fate not to go home or see the ones you love until you go again to egypt s river  watered by zeus  and kill a hundred cows  to please the deathless gods who live in heaven  then they will let you travel where you wish   i felt heartbroken that i had to cross  the misty sea and go again to egypt  a long and bitter journey  but i answered   sir  i will do exactly as you say  but come now  tell me this  and tell me truly  did all the greeks sail safely home by ship  whom nestor and myself left there in troy  did any meet a dreadful death at sea  on his own ship  or in familiar arms  after the war wound up   when i said this  at once he answered me and said these words    o son of atreus  why ask me this  you have no need to know or learn my mind  when i have told you  you will not be long able to hold back tears  so many men were killed  and many left behind at troy  just two of all the bronze clad captains died while traveling back home  one more perhaps may be alive  trapped somewhere out at sea  ajax was drowned  his ships were sunk  poseidon first drove him to the rocks of gyrae  then  rescued him from the sea  he would have lived  despite athena s hatred  but he made a crazy boast that he survived the waves against the wishes of the gods  poseidon heard his rash words  at once  he seized his trident in mighty hands  and hit the gyran rock  one half remained  the other  on which ajax sat as he boasted  cracked right off and fell into the sea  and carried him deep down  the boundless waves washed over him  he drank  the salty brine  and died  but agamemnon survived the goddess hera saved his fleet  when he had almost reached the craggy mountain of malea  a gust of wind took hold and bore him over waves where fish were jumping  across the rumbling depths to where all farms are finished  where thyestes used to live  and now his son aegisthus  after that  the route was clear  the gods made all winds fair  then joyfully he stepped foot in his country   and touched and kissed the earth of his dear home  he wept hot floods of tears  from happiness  but from the lookout post the watchman saw him  scheming aegisthus paid that man two talents of gold to watch all year  so agamemnon could not slip past unseen  or summon up his will to fight  the spy rushed off to tell the king  aegisthus formed a plan at once  he chose the twenty best men in the land to lurk in ambush  and he told the house slaves  to cook a feast  he rode out on his carriage  and summoned agamemnon  who suspected nothing  aegisthus killed him over dinner  just as a person kills an ox at manger  all of the men who came with him were killed  and all those of aegisthus  all were killed   his story broke my heart  and i sat down upon the sands and wept  i did not want to go on living or to see the sun  i thrashed around and wailed  when i was done   the old sea god spoke words of truth to me   now  son of atreus  your endless weeping has gone on long enough  it does no good  quickly  go home  you may still find aegisthus alive  or else orestes may have come and killed him  you can join his funeral   those words made me a man again  my heart was warmed inside  despite my grief  my words took wings  i said   i know now of those two  but name the third who may be still alive   trapped somewhere in the wide expanse of sea  or may be dead  i know the news may hurt  but still i want to hear it   and he answered   it is laertes  son  the ithacan  i saw him crying  shedding floods of tears upon calypso s island  in her chambers  she traps him there  he cannot go back home  he has no boats with oars or crew to row him across the sea s broad back to his own land  but menelaus  it is not your fate  to die in argos  gods will carry you off to the world s end  to elysium  those fields are ruled by tawny rhadamanthus and life is there the easiest for humans  there is no snow  no heavy storms or rain  but ocean always sends up gentle breezes of zephyr to refresh the people there  you gain these blessings as the son in law of zeus through helen   then the old god sank beneath the waves  i went back to my ships  and godlike men  and as i walked my mind swirled with my many thoughts  beside the fleet we cooked and ate our meal  then holy night came down  we slept beside the surging water  when early dawn appeared and touched the sky with blossom  first we launched the balanced ships into the salty sea  put up the masts and fixed the sails  and then the men embarked and sat on benches neatly  in their lines  and then at once they struck the sea with oars   we soon reached egypt s holy rain fed river  we docked the ships and sacrificed the oxen  when i had quenched the anger of the gods  i built a mound to honor agamemnon  for his immortal fame  the gods at last gave me fair wind  and sent me quickly home  but come now  stay with me here in my palace  until eleven days or twelve have passed  then i will send you off with precious gifts  three horses and a gleaming chariot   also a lovely cup so you can pour gifts to the gods  and always think of me   then tactfully telemachus replied   please do not keep me here so long  my lord  indeed  i would be glad to stay a year  i would not even miss my home or parents  i get such pleasure listening to you  but my poor friends are surely tired of waiting in pylos  you have made me stay too long  and for a gift  please only give me treasure   you keep your lovely horses here  i cannot transport them all the way to ithaca  you rule these open meadows  rich in clover  white barley in wide rows  and wheat and grass  in ithaca  there are no fields or racetracks  though it is only fit for goats  we love it more than horse pasture  islands out at sea have no good grazing ours the least of all   then menelaus smiled and clasped his hand  and spoke to him in his loud booming voice    my boy  your words are proof of your good blood  i will give different gifts  just as you ask  i will give you the finest piece of treasure of all the hoard i have piled up at home  a finely crafted bowl  of purest silver  with gold around the rim  hephaestus made it  and phaedimus the king of sidon gave it to me  when i was visiting his house as i was traveling home  you can have that   such was their conversation  then the guests  entered the palace  bringing lamb and wine that gives one confidence  the girls  all dressed in pretty scarves  brought bread for them  so went the feasting in the house of menelaus  meanwhile  outside odysseus  house  the suitors were as arrogant as usual  enjoying throwing discuses and spears out on the playing field  the two chief suitors  were sitting there  antinous and godlike eurymachus  just then no mon  son  of phronius  approached and asked a question   so do we know  antinous  or not  whether telemachus is coming back from sandy pylos  he left with my ship  i need it  to cross over to the fields of elis  where i have twelve mares with mules suckling their teats and not yet broken in  i want to take and train one   they were all astonished  since they had not thought the boy was gone to pylos  but was somewhere near   out with the sheep or pigs  antinous said   tell me true  when did he go  and who went with him  did he choose some ithacans  or slaves and laborers  it could be either  and tell me also  did he steal the ship from you by force  or did you give it to him freely  because he asked   no mon  son of phronius  replied   i gave it freely  what could i do  when someone so upset was asking me  a noble boy like that   it would have been ungracious to refuse  the young men who were with him were high class  the best in town except ourselves  i saw mentor embark as captain or perhaps not mentor but a god who looked like him  this puzzles me  that yesterday at dawn i saw great mentor here  though he had gone to pylos in the ship   with that  no mon departed for his father s house  those leaders were furious  at once they made the suitors  stop playing games and sit  antinous spoke up with eyes bright as fire  his mind darkened with anger   damn  that stuck up boy succeeded in his stupid trip  we thought he would not manage it  telemachus has launched a ship and picked an ideal crew  despite us all  this is the start of worse  may zeus destroy his strength before he reaches manhood  give me a ship and twenty men  so i may watch and catch him in the strait  in between ithaca and craggy same  a sad end to this journey for his father   all of them praised his words  endorsed his plan  and went inside odysseus  palace  penelope was soon aware of all the suitors  secret plots  the house boy medon told her  since he had been outside the courtyard and he had heard the plans they were devising  he rushed to tell her  as he stepped inside  across the threshold  she came up and asked him    well  boy  why have those lordly suitors sent you  to tell godlike odysseus  girls to stop their work and make a feast for them  i hope this is their final meal  i hope they never gather elsewhere to go courting  you suitors who come crowding here are wasting telemachus  wealth  when you were younger you never paid attention to your fathers who told you of odysseus  greatness  he never spoke or acted without justice   among the people  lords are mostly biased  they favor one person and hate another  but he did not  he did no wrong at all  now you  your wicked deeds and plans are clear  no gratitude for favors from the past   then knowledgeable medon answered her   my queen  i wish this were the worst of it  now they are plotting even greater ruin  may zeus ensure it never comes to pass  the suitors want to kill telemachus  with sharp bronze weapons on his journey home  he went to sandy pylos and to sparta for word about his father   at the news  her legs grew weak  her heart sank  she was struck dumb for a time  her voice blocked as her eyes filled up with tears  at last she answered him   but why did my son go away  there was no need to go on those swift ships that gallop like horses over miles of salty water  did he intend to lose his name as well   and be unknown   and medon said   perhaps some god or his own heart nudged him to go to pylos to find out about his father  if he will come back home  or if he has already met his fate   with that  he left her  grief wrapped around her  eating at her heart  the house was full of chairs but she could not bear to sit upright  in her bedroom doorway  collapsing on the floor  she wept and cried  around her all her women  young and old   were whimpering  voice thick with tears  she sobbed   friends  listen  zeus has cursed me more than all the women of my family  already i lost my noble  lionhearted husband  most talented and brave of all the greeks  whose fame is spread through greece  and now the winds have taken my dear son  and no one told me that he was setting out  shame on you all  you knew that he was leaving in that ship  not one of you came here to wake me up   if only i had known about his journey  he would have stayed no matter how he wanted to leave or else have left me dead right here  now call old dolius  my gardener  the slave who cares for all my trees  my father gave him to me when i came here  tell him to hurry off and sit beside laertes  and tell him everything  he may decide to go in tears to plead with those who want to kill godlike odysseus  son   his grandson   then the loyal eurycleia said   lady  sweetheart  even if you take a sword and kill me  i will tell the truth  i knew all this  i gave him what he asked for  bread and sweet wine  he made me swear an oath not to inform you  till twelve days had passed  or till you heard about it  and you missed him  so that you would not cry and spoil your beauty  now have a bath  get changed into clean clothes  go with your slave girls upstairs to your room   pray to athena  child of zeus the king  she may save him from death  and do not bother poor old laertes  he has pain enough  i do not think the blessed gods despise this family  i trust that there will always be one to rule this house and rich estate   this soothed penelope  she dried her tears  and took her bath and got dressed in clean clothes  then went up to her bedroom with her girls  she put some barley on a tray and prayed    hear me  athena  tireless child of zeus  if my quick minded husband ever gave you fat thighs of beef or lamb here in our halls  remember now and save the son i love  protect him from the abuses of those suitors   she wailed aloud  the goddess heard her prayer  the suitors made a racket that resounded all through the palace shadows  they were boasting   this queen whom all of us have come here courting is ready now to marry one of us   and does not even know her son will die   they spoke not knowing how things really stood  antinous declared to them   my lords  you have to stop this bragging  quiet down  or those inside will hear it  now get up in silence  we must go and follow through the plan we all agreed on in our hearts   with that  he picked the twenty strongest men  they went down to the seashore  first of all they launched the swift black ship in deep saltwater   set up the mast and raised the sails and fit the oars in proper order in the straps of leather  then spread out the bright white sails  with confidence their slaves dealt out the weapons  they moored high up the stream and disembarked  they ate there  while they waited for the evening  penelope lay upstairs in her bedroom  refusing food and drink  consuming nothing  she wondered if her fine son would escape from death  or be brought down by those proud suitors   her mind was like a lion  caught by humans  when they are clustering round him in a circle  trying to trap him  so sweet drowsiness subdued her and she slept  her limbs relaxed  athena  bright eyed goddess  had a plan  she made a phantom looking like a woman  iphthime  child of great icarius  the wife of eumelus who lived in pherae  she sent it to odysseus  house  to make penelope feel less distressed  and stop her tears of grief  it traveled through the latch s thong  and in her bedroom stood above her head  and asked   penelope  are you asleep  and are you still upset  the gods who live at ease have no desire for you to weep or worry  know  your son is coming home  he has not wronged the gods   intelligent penelope  still sleeping sweetly inside the gates of dreams  replied   sister  why have you come  your house is far   and you have never visited before  you tell me to stop grieving and not feel the many pains that prickle at my heart  but long ago i lost my lionhearted husband  a man more talented than any  famous throughout all greece  now my dear son has sailed off in a ship  though he knows nothing of hardship and the world  he is a child  i worry for him more than for his father  i shudder  i am scared of what may happen   at sea  or in the country that he went to  he has so many enemies  they plan to murder him before he reaches home   the misty phantom answered her   have courage  let not your heart be troubled or afraid  he has a goddess as his guide athena  a helper many men have prayed to have  she has great power  pitying your grief  she sent me here to tell you all of this   careful penelope replied   if you  are actually a god  with news from gods  tell me about my husband too  poor man  tell if he is alive and sees the sun  or dead already in the house of hades   the spirit said   i cannot tell you whether he is alive or dead  it is not good to speak of things intangible as wind   with that  the phantom floated through the air into the breeze  and then penelope woke up from sleep  and she was glad at heart   because she dreamed so clearly in the night  the suitors got on board and sailed across the water  set on murdering the boy  there is a rocky island out at sea  in between ithaca and craggy same  called asteris quite small but with a harbor to shelter ships  and there they lurked in

From the goddess to the storm then dawn rose up from bed with lord tithonus, to bring the light to deathless gods and mortals. the gods sat down for council, with the great thunderlord zeus. athena was concerned about odysseus  many troubles, trapped by the nymph calypso in her house.  father, and all immortal gods,  she said,  no longer let a sceptered king be kind, or gentle, or pay heed to right and wrong. let every king be cruel, his acts unjust!

Odysseus ruled gently, like a father, but no one even thinks about him now. the wretched man is stranded on an island; calypso forces him to stay with her. he cannot make his way back to his country. he has no ships, no oars, and no companions to help him sail across the wide-backed sea. his son has gone for news of his lost father, in sandy pylos and in splendid sparta; they plot to kill the boy when he returns! 

Smiling at her, lord zeus who heaps the clouds replied,  ah, daughter! what a thing to say! did you not plan all this yourself, so that odysseus could come and take revenge upon those suitors? now use all your skill: ensure telemachus comes safely home, and that the suitors fail and sail away.  then turning to his son he said,  dear hermes, you are my messenger. go tell the goddess our fixed intention: that odysseus

Must go back home he has endured enough. without a god or human as his guide, he will drift miserably for twenty days upon a makeshift raft, and then arrive at fertile scheria. the magical phaeacians will respect him like a god, and send him in a ship to his dear homeland, with gifts of bronze and heaps of gold and clothing, more than he would have brought with him from troy if he had come directly, with his share

Of plunder. it is granted him to see the ones he loves, beneath his own high roof, in his own country.  hermes heard these words. at once he fastened on his feet the sandals of everlasting gold with which he flies on breath of air across the sea and land; he seized the wand he uses to enchant men s eyes to sleep or wake as he desires, and flew. the god flashed bright in all his power. he touched pieria, then from the sky

He plunged into the sea and swooped between the waves, just like a seagull catching fish, wetting its whirring wings in tireless brine. so hermes scudded through the surging swell. then finally, he reached the distant island, stepped from the indigo water to the shore, and reached the cavern where the goddess lived. there sat calypso with her braided curls. beside the hearth a mighty fire was burning. the scent of citrus and of brittle pine

Suffused the island. inside, she was singing and weaving with a shuttle made of gold. her voice was beautiful. around the cave a luscious forest flourished: alder, poplar, and scented cypress. it was full of wings. birds nested there but hunted out at sea: the owls, the hawks, the gulls with gaping beaks. a ripe and luscious vine, hung thick with grapes, was stretched to coil around her cave. four springs spurted with sparkling water as they laced

With crisscross currents intertwined together. the meadow softly bloomed with celery and violets. he gazed around in wonder and joy, at sights to please even a god. even the deathless god who once killed argos stood still, his heart amazed at all he saw. at last he went inside the cave. calypso, the splendid goddess, knew the god on sight: the deathless gods all recognize each other, however far away their homes may be.

But hermes did not find odysseus, since he was sitting by the shore as usual, sobbing in grief and pain; his heart was breaking. in tears he stared across the fruitless sea. divine calypso told her guest to sit upon a gleaming, glittering chair, and said,  dear friend, lord hermes of the golden wand, why have you come? you do not often visit. what do you have in mind? my heart inclines to help you if i can, if it is fated.

For now, come in, and let me make you welcome.  at that the goddess led him to a table heaped with ambrosia, and she mixed a drink: red nectar. so mercurial hermes drank and ate till he was satisfied, and then the diplomat explained why he had come.  you are a goddess, i a god and yet you ask why i am here. well, i will tell you. zeus ordered me to come i did not want to. who would desire to cross such an expanse

Of endless salty sea? no human town is near here, where gods get fine sacrifices. still, none can sway or check the will of zeus. he says the most unhappy man alive is living here a warrior from those who fought the town of priam for nine years and in the tenth they sacked it and sailed home. but on the journey back, they wronged athena. she roused the wind and surging sea against them and all his brave companions were destroyed,

While he himself was blown here by the waves. zeus orders you to send him on his way at once, since it is not his destiny to die here far away from those he loves. it is his fate to see his family and come back home, to his own native land.  calypso shuddered and let fly at him.  you cruel, jealous gods! you bear a grudge whenever any goddess takes a man to sleep with as a lover in her bed.

Just so the gods who live at ease were angry when rosy-fingered dawn took up orion, and from her golden throne, chaste artemis attacked and killed him with her gentle arrows. demeter with the cornrows in her hair indulged her own desire, and she made love with iasion in triple-furrowed fields  till zeus found out, hurled flashing flame and killed him. so now, you male gods are upset with me for living with a man. a man i saved!

Zeus pinned his ship and with his flash of lightning smashed it to pieces. all his friends were killed out on the wine-dark sea. this man alone, clutching the keel, was swept by wind and wave, and came here, to my home. i cared for him and loved him, and i vowed to set him free from time and death forever. still, i know no other god can change the will of zeus. so let him go, if that is zeus  order, across the barren sea. i will not give

An escort for this trip across the water; i have no ships or rowers. but i will share what i know with him, and gladly give useful advice so he can safely reach his home.  the mediator, zeus  servant, replied,  then send him now, avoid the wrath of zeus, do not enrage him, or one day his rage will hurt you.  with these words, he vanished. acknowledging the edict sent from zeus, the goddess went to find odysseus.

She found him on the shore. his eyes were always tearful; he wept sweet life away, in longing to go back home, since she no longer pleased him. he had no choice. he spent his nights with her inside her hollow cave, not wanting her though she still wanted him. by day he sat out on the rocky beach, in tears and grief, staring in heartbreak at the fruitless sea. the goddess stood by him and said,  poor man! stop grieving, please. you need not waste your life.

I am quite ready now to send you off. using your sword of bronze, cut trunks and build a raft, fix decks across, and let it take you across the misty sea. i will provide water, red wine, and food, to stop you starving, and i will give you clothes, and send a wind to blow you safely home, if this is what those sky gods want. they are more powerful than me; they get their way.  odysseus, informed by many years of pain and loss,

Shuddered and let his words fly out at her.  goddess, you have some other scheme in mind, not my safe passage. you are telling me to cross this vast and terrifying gulf, in just a raft, when even stable schooners sped on by winds from zeus would not succeed? no, goddess, i will not get on a raft, unless you swear to me a mighty oath you are not planning yet more pain for me.  at that, divine calypso smiled at him.

She reached out and caressed him with her hand, saying,  you scalawag! what you have said shows that you understand how these things work. but by this earth, and by the sky above, and by the waters of the styx below, which is the strongest oath for blessed gods, i swear i will not plot more pain for you. i have made plans for you as i would do for my own self, if i were in your place. i am not made of iron; no, my heart

Is kind and decent, and i pity you.  and with those words, the goddess quickly turned and led the way; he followed in her footsteps. they reached the cave together, man and goddess. the chair that hermes had been sitting on was empty now; odysseus sat there. the goddess gave him human food and drink. she sat and faced godlike odysseus while slave girls brought her nectar and ambrosia. they reached to take the good things set before them,

And satisfied their hunger and their thirst. the goddess-queen began.  odysseus, son of laertes, blessed by zeus your plans are always changing. do you really want to go back to that home you love so much? well then, good-bye! but if you understood how glutted you will be with suffering before you reach your home, you would stay here with me and be immortal though you might still wish to see that wife you always pine for.

And anyway, i know my body is better than hers is. i am taller too. mortals can never rival the immortals in beauty.  so odysseus, with tact, said  do not be enraged at me, great goddess. you are quite right. i know my modest wife penelope could never match your beauty. she is a human; you are deathless, ageless. but even so, i want to go back home, and every day i hope that day will come.

If some god strikes me on the wine-dark sea, i will endure it. by now i am used to suffering i have gone through so much, at sea and in the war. let this come too.  the sun went down and brought the darkness on. they went inside the hollow cave and took the pleasure of their love, held close together. when vernal dawn first touched the sky with flowers, they rose and dressed: odysseus put on his cloak and tunic, and calypso wore

Her fine long robe of silver. round her waist she wrapped a golden belt, and veiled her head. then she prepared the journey for the man. she gave an axe that fitted in his grip, its handle made of finest olive wood; its huge bronze blade was sharp on either side. she also gave a polished adze. she led him out to the island s end, where tall trees grew: black poplar, alder, fir that touched the sky, good for a nimble boat of seasoned timber.

When she had shown him where the tall trees grew, calypso, queen of goddesses, went home. odysseus began and made good progress. with his bronze axe he cut down twenty trunks, polished them skillfully and planed them straight. calypso brought a gimlet and he drilled through every plank and fitted them together, fixing it firm with pegs and fastenings. as wide as when a man who knows his trade marks out the curving hull to fit a ship,

So wide odysseus marked out his raft. he notched the side decks to the close-set frame and fixed long planks along the ribs to finish. he set a mast inside, and joined to it a yardarm and a rudder to steer straight. he heaped the boat with brush, and caulked the sides with wickerwork, to keep the water out. calypso brought him fabric for a sail, and he constructed that with equal skill. he fastened up the braces, clews and halyards,

And using levers, launched her on the sea. the work had taken four days; on the fifth calypso let him go. she washed and dressed him in clothes that smelled of incense. on the raft she put a flask of wine, a bigger flask of water, and a large supply of food. she sent him off with gentle, lukewarm breezes. gladly odysseus spread out his sails to catch the wind; with skill he steered the rudder. no sleep fell on his eyes; he watched the stars,

The pleiades, late-setting bo tes, and bear, which people also call the plow, which circles in one place, and marks orion  the only star that has no share of ocean. calypso, queen of goddesses, had told him to keep the bear on his left side while sailing. he sailed the sea for seven days and ten, and on the eighteenth day, a murky mountain of the phaeacian land appeared it rose up like a shield beyond the misty sea.

Returning from the ethiopians, and pausing on mount solyma, poseidon, master of earthquakes, saw the distant raft. enraged, he shook his head and told himself,  this is outrageous! so it seems the gods have changed their plans about odysseus while i was absent! he has almost reached phaeacia, where it is his destiny to flee the rope of pain that binds him now. but i will goad him to more misery,

Till he is sick of it.  he gathered up the clouds, and seized his trident and stirred round the sea and roused the gusts of every wind, and covered earth and sea with fog. night stretched from heaven. eurus, notus, blasting zephyr and boreas, the child of sky, all fell and rolled a mighty wave. odysseus grew weak at knees. he cried out in despair,  more pain? how will it end? i am afraid the goddess spoke the truth: that i will have

A sea of sufferings before i reach my homeland. it is coming true! zeus whirls the air. look at those clouds! he agitates the waves, as winds attack from all directions. i can hold on to one thing: certain death. those greeks were lucky, three and four times over, who died upon the plain of troy to help the sons of atreus. i wish i had died that same day the mass of trojans hurled their bronze-tipped spears at me around the corpse

Of peleus  son. i would have had a funeral, and honor from the greeks; but now i have to die this cruel death!  a wave crashed onto him, and overturned the raft, and he fell out. the rudder slipped out of his hands. the winds blew all directions and one enormous gust snapped off the mast. the sail and yardarm drifted out to sea. then for a long time rushing, crashing waves kept him submerged: he could not reach the surface.

The clothes calypso gave him weighed him down. at last he rose and spat the sour saltwater out of his mouth it gushed forth in a torrent. despite his pain and weakness, he remembered his raft, and lunged to get it through the waves; he climbed on top of it and clung to life. the great waves carried it this way and that. as when the thistles, clumping close together, are borne across the prairie by the north wind, so these winds swept the raft across the sea.

The south wind hurls it, then the north wind grabs it, then east wind yields and lets the west wind drive it. but stepping softly, ino, the white goddess, cadmus  child, once human, human-voiced, now honored with the gods in salty depths, noticed that he was suffering and lost, with pity. like a gull with wings outstretched she rose up from the sea, sat on the raft and said,  poor man! why does enraged poseidon create an odyssey of pain for you?

But his hostility will not destroy you. you seem intelligent. do as i say. strip off your clothes and leave the raft behind for winds to take away. with just your arms swim to phaeacia. fate decrees that there you will survive. here, take my scarf and tie it under your chest: with this immortal veil, you need not be afraid of death or danger. but when you reach dry earth, untie the scarf and throw it out to sea, away from land,

And turn away.  with that, the goddess gave it, and plunged back down inside the surging sea, just like a gull. the black wave covered her. the hero who had suffered so much danger was troubled and confused. he asked himself,  some deity has said to leave the raft. but what if gods are weaving tricks again? i will not trust her yet: with my own eyes i saw the land she said i should escape to, and it is far away. i will do this:

As long as these wood timbers hold together, i will hang on, however hard it is. but when the waves have smashed my raft to pieces, then i will have no choice, and i will swim.  while he was thinking this, the lord of earthquakes, poseidon, roused a huge and dreadful wave that arched above his head: he hurled it at him. as when a fierce wind ruffles up a heap of dry wheat chaff; it scatters here and there; so were the raft s long timbers flung apart.

He climbed astride a plank and rode along as if on horseback. he took off the clothes calypso gave him, but he tied the scarf around his chest, and dove into the sea, spreading his arms to swim. the lord of earthquakes saw him and nodded, muttering,  at last you are in pain! go drift across the sea, till you meet people blessed by zeus, the sky lord. but even then, i think you will not lack for suffering.  he spurred his fine-maned horses,

And went to aegae, where he had his home. athena, child of zeus, devised a plan. she blocked the path of all the other winds, told them to cease and made them go to sleep, but roused swift boreas and smoothed the waves in front of him, so that odysseus could reach phaeacia and escape from death. two days and nights he drifted on the waves: each moment he expected he would die. but when the dawn with dazzling braids brought day

For the third time, the wind died down. no breeze, but total calm. as he was lifted up by an enormous wave, he scanned around, and saw the shore nearby. as when a father lies sick and weak for many days, tormented by some cruel spirit, till at last the gods restore him back to life; his children feel great joy; odysseus felt that same joy when he saw land. he swam and longed to set his feet on earth. but when he was in earshot,

He heard the boom of surf against the rocks. the mighty waves were crashing on the shore, a dreadful belching. everything was covered in salty foam. there were no sheltering harbors for ships, just sheer crags, reefs and solid cliffs. odysseus  heart and legs gave way. shaken but purposeful, he told himself,  zeus went beyond my hopes and let me see dry land! i made it, cutting the abyss! but i see no way out from this gray sea.

There are steep cliffs offshore, and all around the rushing water roars; the rock runs sheer; the sea is deep near shore; there is no way to set my feet on land without disaster. if i attempt to scramble out, a wave will seize and dash me on the jagged rock; a useless effort. but if i swim on farther, looking for bays or coves or slanting beaches, storm winds may seize me once again and drag me, howling with grief, towards the fish-filled sea.

A god may even send a great sea-monster, the kind that famous amphitrite rears. i know poseidon wants to do me harm.  as he was thinking this, the waves grew big and hurled him at the craggy shore. his skin would have been ripped away, and his bones smashed, had not athena given him a thought. he grabbed a rock as he was swept along with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, till the wave passed by. but then the swell rushed back,

And struck him hard and hurled him out to sea. as when an octopus, dragged from its den, has many pebbles sticking to its suckers, so his strong hands were skinned against the rocks. a mighty wave rolled over him again. he would have died too soon, in misery, without the inspiration of athena. he came up from the wave that spewed to shore and swam towards the land, in search of beaches with gradual slopes, or inlets from the sea.

He swam until he reached a river s mouth with gentle waters; that place seemed ideal, smooth and not stony, sheltered from the wind. he sensed its current; in his heart he prayed,  unknown god, hear me! how i longed for you! i have escaped the salt sea and poseidon. even the deathless gods respect a man who is as lost as i am now. i have gone through so much and reached your flowing streams. pity me, lord! i am your supplicant. 

The current ceased; the river god restrained the waves and made them calm. he brought him safe into the river mouth. his legs cramped up; the sea had broken him. his swollen body gushed brine from mouth and nostrils. there he lay, winded and silent, hardly fit to move. a terrible exhaustion overcame him. when he could breathe and think again, he took the goddess  scarf off, and let it go into the river flowing to the sea;

Strong currents swept it down and ino s hands took it. he crawled on land and crouched beside the reeds and bent to kiss life-giving earth, and trembling, he spoke to his own heart.  what now? what will become of me? if i stay up all wretched night beside this river, the cruel frost and gentle dew together may finish me: my life is thin with weakness. at dawn a cold breeze blows beside the river. but if i climb the slope to those dark woods

And go to rest in that thick undergrowth, letting sweet sleep take hold of me, and losing my cold and weariness wild beasts may find me and treat me as their prey.  but he decided to go into the woods. he found a place beside a clearing, near the water s edge. he crawled beneath two bushes grown together, of thorn and olive. no strong wet wind could blow through them, no shining sunbeam ever strike them, no rain could penetrate them; they were growing

So thickly intertwined. odysseus crept under, and he scraped a bed together, of leaves: there were enough to cover two against the worst of winter. seeing this, the hero who had suffered for so long was happy. he lay down inside and heaped more leaves on top. as when a man who lives out on a lonely farm that has no neighbors buries a glowing torch inside black embers to save the seed of fire and keep a source 

So was odysseus concealed in leaves. athena poured down sleep to shut his eyes so all his painful weariness could end.",from the goddess to the storm then dawn rose up from bed with lord tithonus  to bring the light to deathless gods and mortals  the gods sat down for council  with the great thunderlord zeus  athena was concerned about odysseus  many troubles  trapped by the nymph calypso in her house   father  and all immortal gods   she said   no longer let a sceptered king be kind  or gentle  or pay heed to right and wrong  let every king be cruel  his acts unjust   odysseus ruled gently  like a father  but no one even thinks about him now  the wretched man is stranded on an island  calypso forces him to stay with her  he cannot make his way back to his country  he has no ships  no oars  and no companions to help him sail across the wide backed sea  his son has gone for news of his lost father  in sandy pylos and in splendid sparta  they plot to kill the boy when he returns    smiling at her  lord zeus who heaps the clouds replied   ah  daughter  what a thing to say  did you not plan all this yourself  so that odysseus could come and take revenge upon those suitors  now use all your skill  ensure telemachus comes safely home  and that the suitors fail and sail away   then turning to his son he said   dear hermes  you are my messenger  go tell the goddess our fixed intention  that odysseus  must go back home he has endured enough  without a god or human as his guide  he will drift miserably for twenty days upon a makeshift raft  and then arrive at fertile scheria  the magical phaeacians will respect him like a god  and send him in a ship to his dear homeland  with gifts of bronze and heaps of gold and clothing  more than he would have brought with him from troy if he had come directly  with his share  of plunder  it is granted him to see the ones he loves  beneath his own high roof  in his own country   hermes heard these words  at once he fastened on his feet the sandals of everlasting gold with which he flies on breath of air across the sea and land  he seized the wand he uses to enchant men s eyes to sleep or wake as he desires  and flew  the god flashed bright in all his power  he touched pieria  then from the sky  he plunged into the sea and swooped between the waves  just like a seagull catching fish  wetting its whirring wings in tireless brine  so hermes scudded through the surging swell  then finally  he reached the distant island  stepped from the indigo water to the shore  and reached the cavern where the goddess lived  there sat calypso with her braided curls  beside the hearth a mighty fire was burning  the scent of citrus and of brittle pine  suffused the island  inside  she was singing and weaving with a shuttle made of gold  her voice was beautiful  around the cave a luscious forest flourished  alder  poplar  and scented cypress  it was full of wings  birds nested there but hunted out at sea  the owls  the hawks  the gulls with gaping beaks  a ripe and luscious vine  hung thick with grapes  was stretched to coil around her cave  four springs spurted with sparkling water as they laced  with crisscross currents intertwined together  the meadow softly bloomed with celery and violets  he gazed around in wonder and joy  at sights to please even a god  even the deathless god who once killed argos stood still  his heart amazed at all he saw  at last he went inside the cave  calypso  the splendid goddess  knew the god on sight  the deathless gods all recognize each other  however far away their homes may be   but hermes did not find odysseus  since he was sitting by the shore as usual  sobbing in grief and pain  his heart was breaking  in tears he stared across the fruitless sea  divine calypso told her guest to sit upon a gleaming  glittering chair  and said   dear friend  lord hermes of the golden wand  why have you come  you do not often visit  what do you have in mind  my heart inclines to help you if i can  if it is fated   for now  come in  and let me make you welcome   at that the goddess led him to a table heaped with ambrosia  and she mixed a drink  red nectar  so mercurial hermes drank and ate till he was satisfied  and then the diplomat explained why he had come   you are a goddess  i a god and yet you ask why i am here  well  i will tell you  zeus ordered me to come i did not want to  who would desire to cross such an expanse  of endless salty sea  no human town is near here  where gods get fine sacrifices  still  none can sway or check the will of zeus  he says the most unhappy man alive is living here a warrior from those who fought the town of priam for nine years and in the tenth they sacked it and sailed home  but on the journey back  they wronged athena  she roused the wind and surging sea against them and all his brave companions were destroyed   while he himself was blown here by the waves  zeus orders you to send him on his way at once  since it is not his destiny to die here far away from those he loves  it is his fate to see his family and come back home  to his own native land   calypso shuddered and let fly at him   you cruel  jealous gods  you bear a grudge whenever any goddess takes a man to sleep with as a lover in her bed   just so the gods who live at ease were angry when rosy fingered dawn took up orion  and from her golden throne  chaste artemis attacked and killed him with her gentle arrows  demeter with the cornrows in her hair indulged her own desire  and she made love with iasion in triple furrowed fields  till zeus found out  hurled flashing flame and killed him  so now  you male gods are upset with me for living with a man  a man i saved   zeus pinned his ship and with his flash of lightning smashed it to pieces  all his friends were killed out on the wine dark sea  this man alone  clutching the keel  was swept by wind and wave  and came here  to my home  i cared for him and loved him  and i vowed to set him free from time and death forever  still  i know no other god can change the will of zeus  so let him go  if that is zeus  order  across the barren sea  i will not give  an escort for this trip across the water  i have no ships or rowers  but i will share what i know with him  and gladly give useful advice so he can safely reach his home   the mediator  zeus  servant  replied   then send him now  avoid the wrath of zeus  do not enrage him  or one day his rage will hurt you   with these words  he vanished  acknowledging the edict sent from zeus  the goddess went to find odysseus   she found him on the shore  his eyes were always tearful  he wept sweet life away  in longing to go back home  since she no longer pleased him  he had no choice  he spent his nights with her inside her hollow cave  not wanting her though she still wanted him  by day he sat out on the rocky beach  in tears and grief  staring in heartbreak at the fruitless sea  the goddess stood by him and said   poor man  stop grieving  please  you need not waste your life   i am quite ready now to send you off  using your sword of bronze  cut trunks and build a raft  fix decks across  and let it take you across the misty sea  i will provide water  red wine  and food  to stop you starving  and i will give you clothes  and send a wind to blow you safely home  if this is what those sky gods want  they are more powerful than me  they get their way   odysseus  informed by many years of pain and loss   shuddered and let his words fly out at her   goddess  you have some other scheme in mind  not my safe passage  you are telling me to cross this vast and terrifying gulf  in just a raft  when even stable schooners sped on by winds from zeus would not succeed  no  goddess  i will not get on a raft  unless you swear to me a mighty oath you are not planning yet more pain for me   at that  divine calypso smiled at him   she reached out and caressed him with her hand  saying   you scalawag  what you have said shows that you understand how these things work  but by this earth  and by the sky above  and by the waters of the styx below  which is the strongest oath for blessed gods  i swear i will not plot more pain for you  i have made plans for you as i would do for my own self  if i were in your place  i am not made of iron  no  my heart  is kind and decent  and i pity you   and with those words  the goddess quickly turned and led the way  he followed in her footsteps  they reached the cave together  man and goddess  the chair that hermes had been sitting on was empty now  odysseus sat there  the goddess gave him human food and drink  she sat and faced godlike odysseus while slave girls brought her nectar and ambrosia  they reached to take the good things set before them   and satisfied their hunger and their thirst  the goddess queen began   odysseus  son of laertes  blessed by zeus your plans are always changing  do you really want to go back to that home you love so much  well then  good bye  but if you understood how glutted you will be with suffering before you reach your home  you would stay here with me and be immortal though you might still wish to see that wife you always pine for   and anyway  i know my body is better than hers is  i am taller too  mortals can never rival the immortals in beauty   so odysseus  with tact  said  do not be enraged at me  great goddess  you are quite right  i know my modest wife penelope could never match your beauty  she is a human  you are deathless  ageless  but even so  i want to go back home  and every day i hope that day will come   if some god strikes me on the wine dark sea  i will endure it  by now i am used to suffering i have gone through so much  at sea and in the war  let this come too   the sun went down and brought the darkness on  they went inside the hollow cave and took the pleasure of their love  held close together  when vernal dawn first touched the sky with flowers  they rose and dressed  odysseus put on his cloak and tunic  and calypso wore  her fine long robe of silver  round her waist she wrapped a golden belt  and veiled her head  then she prepared the journey for the man  she gave an axe that fitted in his grip  its handle made of finest olive wood  its huge bronze blade was sharp on either side  she also gave a polished adze  she led him out to the island s end  where tall trees grew  black poplar  alder  fir that touched the sky  good for a nimble boat of seasoned timber   when she had shown him where the tall trees grew  calypso  queen of goddesses  went home  odysseus began and made good progress  with his bronze axe he cut down twenty trunks  polished them skillfully and planed them straight  calypso brought a gimlet and he drilled through every plank and fitted them together  fixing it firm with pegs and fastenings  as wide as when a man who knows his trade marks out the curving hull to fit a ship   so wide odysseus marked out his raft  he notched the side decks to the close set frame and fixed long planks along the ribs to finish  he set a mast inside  and joined to it a yardarm and a rudder to steer straight  he heaped the boat with brush  and caulked the sides with wickerwork  to keep the water out  calypso brought him fabric for a sail  and he constructed that with equal skill  he fastened up the braces  clews and halyards   and using levers  launched her on the sea  the work had taken four days  on the fifth calypso let him go  she washed and dressed him in clothes that smelled of incense  on the raft she put a flask of wine  a bigger flask of water  and a large supply of food  she sent him off with gentle  lukewarm breezes  gladly odysseus spread out his sails to catch the wind  with skill he steered the rudder  no sleep fell on his eyes  he watched the stars   the pleiades  late setting bo tes  and bear  which people also call the plow  which circles in one place  and marks orion  the only star that has no share of ocean  calypso  queen of goddesses  had told him to keep the bear on his left side while sailing  he sailed the sea for seven days and ten  and on the eighteenth day  a murky mountain of the phaeacian land appeared it rose up like a shield beyond the misty sea   returning from the ethiopians  and pausing on mount solyma  poseidon  master of earthquakes  saw the distant raft  enraged  he shook his head and told himself   this is outrageous  so it seems the gods have changed their plans about odysseus while i was absent  he has almost reached phaeacia  where it is his destiny to flee the rope of pain that binds him now  but i will goad him to more misery   till he is sick of it   he gathered up the clouds  and seized his trident and stirred round the sea and roused the gusts of every wind  and covered earth and sea with fog  night stretched from heaven  eurus  notus  blasting zephyr and boreas  the child of sky  all fell and rolled a mighty wave  odysseus grew weak at knees  he cried out in despair   more pain  how will it end  i am afraid the goddess spoke the truth  that i will have  a sea of sufferings before i reach my homeland  it is coming true  zeus whirls the air  look at those clouds  he agitates the waves  as winds attack from all directions  i can hold on to one thing  certain death  those greeks were lucky  three and four times over  who died upon the plain of troy to help the sons of atreus  i wish i had died that same day the mass of trojans hurled their bronze tipped spears at me around the corpse  of peleus  son  i would have had a funeral  and honor from the greeks  but now i have to die this cruel death   a wave crashed onto him  and overturned the raft  and he fell out  the rudder slipped out of his hands  the winds blew all directions and one enormous gust snapped off the mast  the sail and yardarm drifted out to sea  then for a long time rushing  crashing waves kept him submerged  he could not reach the surface   the clothes calypso gave him weighed him down  at last he rose and spat the sour saltwater out of his mouth it gushed forth in a torrent  despite his pain and weakness  he remembered his raft  and lunged to get it through the waves  he climbed on top of it and clung to life  the great waves carried it this way and that  as when the thistles  clumping close together  are borne across the prairie by the north wind  so these winds swept the raft across the sea   the south wind hurls it  then the north wind grabs it  then east wind yields and let us the west wind drive it  but stepping softly  ino  the white goddess  cadmus  child  once human  human voiced  now honored with the gods in salty depths  noticed that he was suffering and lost  with pity  like a gull with wings outstretched she rose up from the sea  sat on the raft and said   poor man  why does enraged poseidon create an odyssey of pain for you   but his hostility will not destroy you  you seem intelligent  do as i say  strip off your clothes and leave the raft behind for winds to take away  with just your arms swim to phaeacia  fate decrees that there you will survive  here  take my scarf and tie it under your chest  with this immortal veil  you need not be afraid of death or danger  but when you reach dry earth  untie the scarf and throw it out to sea  away from land   and turn away   with that  the goddess gave it  and plunged back down inside the surging sea  just like a gull  the black wave covered her  the hero who had suffered so much danger was troubled and confused  he asked himself   some deity has said to leave the raft  but what if gods are weaving tricks again  i will not trust her yet  with my own eyes i saw the land she said i should escape to  and it is far away  i will do this   as long as these wood timbers hold together  i will hang on  however hard it is  but when the waves have smashed my raft to pieces  then i will have no choice  and i will swim   while he was thinking this  the lord of earthquakes  poseidon  roused a huge and dreadful wave that arched above his head  he hurled it at him  as when a fierce wind ruffles up a heap of dry wheat chaff  it scatters here and there  so were the raft s long timbers flung apart   he climbed astride a plank and rode along as if on horseback  he took off the clothes calypso gave him  but he tied the scarf around his chest  and dove into the sea  spreading his arms to swim  the lord of earthquakes saw him and nodded  muttering   at last you are in pain  go drift across the sea  till you meet people blessed by zeus  the sky lord  but even then  i think you will not lack for suffering   he spurred his fine maned horses   and went to aegae  where he had his home  athena  child of zeus  devised a plan  she blocked the path of all the other winds  told them to cease and made them go to sleep  but roused swift boreas and smoothed the waves in front of him  so that odysseus could reach phaeacia and escape from death  two days and nights he drifted on the waves  each moment he expected he would die  but when the dawn with dazzling braids brought day  for the third time  the wind died down  no breeze  but total calm  as he was lifted up by an enormous wave  he scanned around  and saw the shore nearby  as when a father lies sick and weak for many days  tormented by some cruel spirit  till at last the gods restore him back to life  his children feel great joy  odysseus felt that same joy when he saw land  he swam and longed to set his feet on earth  but when he was in earshot   he heard the boom of surf against the rocks  the mighty

5,5,1540,1632,1725," 

A princess and her laundry odysseus had suffered. in exhaustion from all his long ordeals, the hero slept. meanwhile, athena went to the phaeacians. this people used to live in hyperia, a land of dancing. but their mighty neighbors, the cyclopes, kept looting them, and they could not hold out. their king, nausithous, brought them to scheria, a distant place, and built a wall around the town, and homes, and temples to the gods, and plots of land.

He went to hades. then alcinous, who has god-given wisdom, came to power. bright-eyed athena traveled to his palace, to help odysseus  journey home. she went inside the decorated bedroom where the young princess, nausicaa, was sleeping, as lovely as a goddess. slaves were sleeping outside her doorway, one on either side; two charming girls with all the graces  gifts. the shining doors were shut, but like the wind

The goddess reached the bed of nausicaa, disguised as her best friend, a girl her age, the daughter of the famous sailor dymas. sharp-eyed athena said,  oh, nausicaa! so lazy! but your mother should have taught you! your clothes are lying there in dirty heaps, though you will soon be married, and you need a pretty dress to wear, and clothes to give to all your bridesmaids. that impresses people, and makes the parents happy. when day comes,

We have to do the laundry. i will come and help you, so the work will soon be done. surely you will not long remain unmarried. the best young men here in your native land already want to court you. so at dawn go ask your father for the cart with mules, to carry dresses, scarves, and sheets. you should ride there, not walk; the washing pools are far from town.  the goddess looked into her eyes, then went back to olympus, which they say

Is where the gods will have their home forever. the place is never shaken by the wind, or wet with rain or blanketed by snow. a cloudless sky is spread above the mountain, white radiance all round. the blessed gods live there in happiness forevermore. then dawn came from her lovely throne, and woke the girl. she was amazed, remembering her dream, and in a fine dress, went to tell her parents, whom she found inside the hall.

Her mother sat beside the hearth and spun sea-purpled yarn, her house girls all around her. her father was just heading out to council with his renowned advisors, since his people had called him to a meeting. she stood near him and said,  dear daddy, please would you set up the wagon with the big smooth wheels for me, so i can take my fine clothes to the river to wash them? they are dirty. and you too should wear clean clothes for meeting your advisors,

Dressed in your best to make important plans. your five sons also two of whom are married, but three are strapping single men they always want to wear nice fresh-laundered clothes when they are going dancing. this is on my mind.  she said this since she felt too shy to talk of marriage to her father. but he knew, and answered,  child, i would not grudge the mules or anything you want. go on! the slaves can fit the wagon with its cargo rack. 

He called the household slaves, and they obeyed. they made the wagon ready and inspected its wheels, led up the mules, and yoked them to it. the girl brought out the multicolored clothes, and put them on the cart, while in a basket her mother packed nutritious food for her  a varied meal, with olives, cheese, and wine, stored in a goatskin. then the girl got in. her mother handed her a golden flask of oil, to use when she had had her bath.

Then nausicaa took up the whip and reins, and cracked the whip. the mules were on their way, eager to go and rattling the harness, bringing the clothes and girl and all her slaves. they reached the lovely river where the pools are always full the water flows in streams and bubbles up from underneath, to wash even the dirtiest of laundry. there they freed the mules and drove them to the river to graze on honeyed grass beside the stream.

The girls brought out the laundry from the cart, and brought it to the washing pools and trod it, competing with each other. when the dirt was gone, they spread the clothes along the shore, where salt sea washes pebbles to the beach. they bathed and rubbed themselves with olive oil. then they sat on the riverbank and ate, and waited for the sun to dry the clothes. but when they finished eating, they took off their head-scarves to play ball. the white-armed princess

Led them in play like artemis the archer, running across the heights of taygetus and erymanthus; she is glad to run with boars and fleet-foot deer. the rustic daughters of zeus the aegis king play round about her, while leto is delighted in her heart, seeing her daughter far above the rest, though all are beautiful. so nausicaa stood out above them all. but when the girl was thinking she should head for home and yoke

The mules, and pack the laundry up again, athena s eyes flashed bright. odysseus must wake up, see the pretty girl, and have an escort to the town of the phaeacians. the princess threw the ball towards a slave girl, who missed the catch. it fell down in an eddy; the girls all started screaming, very loudly. odysseus woke up, and thought things over.  what is this country i have come to now? are all the people wild and violent,

Or good, hospitable, and god-fearing? i heard the sound of female voices. is it nymphs, who frequent the craggy mountaintops, and river streams and meadows lush with grass? or could this noise i hear be human voices? i have to try to find out who they are.  odysseus jumped up from out the bushes. grasping a leafy branch he broke it off to cover up his manly private parts. just as a mountain lion trusts its strength,

And beaten by the rain and wind, its eyes burn bright as it attacks the cows or sheep, or wild deer, and hunger drives it on to try the sturdy pens of sheep so need impelled odysseus to come upon the girls with pretty hair, though he was naked. all caked with salt, he looked a dreadful sight. they ran along the shore quite terrified, some here, some there. but nausicaa stayed still. athena made her legs stop trembling

And gave her courage in her heart. she stood there. he wondered, should he touch her knees, or keep some distance and use charming words, to beg the pretty girl to show him to the town, and give him clothes. at last he thought it best to keep some distance and use words to beg her. the girl might be alarmed at being touched. his words were calculated flattery.  my lady, please! are you divine or human? if you are some great goddess from the sky,

You look like zeus  daughter artemis  you are as tall and beautiful as she. but if you live on earth and are a human, your mother and your father must be lucky, your brothers also lucky three times over. their hearts must be delighted, seeing you, their flourishing new sprout, the dancers  leader. and that man will be luckiest by far, who takes you home with dowry, as his bride. i have seen no one like you. never, no one.

My eyes are dazzled when i look at you. i traveled once to delos, on my way to war and suffering; my troops marched with me. beside apollo s altar sprang a sapling, a fresh young palm. i gazed at it and marveled. i never saw so magical a tree. my lady, you transfix me that same way. i am in awe of you, afraid to touch your knees. but i am desperate. i came from ogygia, and for twenty days storm winds

And waves were driving me, adrift until yesterday some god washed me up right here, perhaps to meet more suffering. i think my troubles will not end until the gods have done their all. my lady, pity me. battered and wrecked, i come to you, you first  and i know no one else in this whole country. show me the town, give me some rags to wear, if you brought any clothes when you came here. so may the gods grant all your heart s desires,

A home and husband, somebody like-minded. for nothing could be better than when two live in one house, their minds in harmony, husband and wife. their enemies are jealous, their friends delighted, and they have great honor.  then white-armed nausicaa replied,  well, stranger, you seem a brave and clever man; you know that zeus apportions happiness to people, to good and bad, each one as he decides. your troubles come from him, and you must bear them.

But since you have arrived here in our land, you will not lack for clothes or anything a person needs in times of desperation. i will show you the town. the people here are called phaeacians, and i am the daughter of the great king alcinous, on whom depends the strength and power of our people.  and then she called her slaves with braided hair.  wait, girls! why are you running from this man? do you believe he is an enemy?

No living person ever born would come to our phaeacia with a hostile mind, since we are much beloved by the gods. our island is remote, washed round by sea; we have no human contact. but this man is lost, poor thing. we must look after him. all foreigners and beggars come from zeus, and any act of kindness is a blessing. so give the stranger food and drink, and wash him down in the river, sheltered from the wind. 

They stopped, and egged each other on to take odysseus to shelter, as the princess, the daughter of alcinous, had told them. they gave him clothes, a tunic and a cloak, the olive oil in the golden flask, and led him down to wash beside the river. odysseus politely said,  now, girls, wait at a distance here, so i can wash my grimy back, and rub myself with oil  it has been quite a while since i have done it.

Please let me wash in private. i am shy of being naked with you pretty girls with lovely hair.  so they withdrew, and told their mistress. then he used the river water to scrub the brine off from his back and shoulders, and wash the crusty sea salt from his hair. but when he was all clean and richly oiled, dressed in the clothes the young unmarried girl had given him, athena made him look bigger and sturdier, and made his hair

Grow curling tendrils like a hyacinth. as when athena and hephaestus teach a knowledgeable craftsman every art, and he pours gold on silver, making objects more beautiful just so athena poured attractiveness across his head and shoulders. then he went off and sat beside the sea; his handsomeness was dazzling. the girl was shocked. she told her slaves with tidy hair,  now listen to me, girls! the gods who live

On mount olympus must have wished this man to come in contact with my godlike people. before, he looked so poor and unrefined; now he is like a god that lives in heaven. i hope i get a man like this as husband, a man that lives here and would like to stay. but, girls, now give the stranger food and drink!  she gave her orders and the girls obeyed  they gave odysseus some food and drink. he wolfed the food and drank. he was half starved;

It had been ages since he tasted food. then white-armed nausicaa had formed a plan. folding the clothes, she packed them in the wagon, and yoked the mules, and then she climbed inside. she gave odysseus some clear instructions.  stranger, get ready; you must go to town, and i will have you meet the best of all our people. you seem smart; do as i say. while we are passing through the fields and farmlands, you have to follow quickly with the girls

Behind the mules, and let me lead the way. then we will reach the lofty city wall, which has a scenic port on either side, and one slim gate, where curved ships are drawn up along the road: a special spot for each. the meeting place surrounds poseidon s shrine, fitted with heavy stones set deep in earth. and there the workers make the ships  equipment  cables and sails and there they plane the oars. phaeacians do not care for archery;

Their passion is for sails and oars and ships, on which they love to cross the dark-gray ocean. the people in the town are proud; i worry that they may speak against me. someone rude may say,  who is that big strong man with her? where did she find that stranger? will he be her husband? she has got him from a ship, a foreigner, since no one lives near here, or else a god, the answer to her prayers, descended from the sky to hold her tight.

Better if she has found herself a man from elsewhere, since she scorns the people here, although she has so many noble suitors.  so they will shame me. i myself would blame a girl who got too intimate with men before her marriage, and who went against her loving parents  rules. but listen, stranger, i will explain the quickest way to gain my father s help to make your way back home. beside the road there is a grove of poplars;

It has a fountain, and a meadow round it. it is athena s place, where father has his orchard and estate, as far from town as human voice can carry. sit down there and wait until i reach my father s house in town. but when you think i have arrived, walk on and ask directions for the palace of king alcinous, my mighty father. it will be very easy finding it; a tiny child could guide you there. it is

Unlike the other houses in phaeacia. go through the courtyard, in the house and on straight to the great hall. you will find my mother sitting beside the hearth by firelight, and spinning her amazing purple wool. she leans against a pillar, slaves behind her. my father has a throne right next to hers; he sits and sips his wine, just like a god. but pass him by, embrace my mother s knees to supplicate. if you do this, you quickly

Will reach your home, however far it is, in happiness. if she is good to you, and looks upon you kindly in her heart, you can be sure of getting to your house, back to your family and native land.  with that, she used her shining whip to urge the mules to go. they left the river streams, and trotted well and clipped their hooves along. she drove an easy pace to let her slaves and great odysseus keep up on foot.

The sun was setting when they reached the grove, the famous sanctuary of athena. odysseus sat in it, and at once he prayed to mighty zeus  daughter.  hear me, daughter of zeus! unvanquished queen! if ever, when that earth-shaker god was wrecking me, you helped me may they pity me and give me kind welcome in phaeacia.  and athena heard him but did not yet appear to him, respecting her own brother in his fury

Against odysseus till he reached home.",a princess and her laundry odysseus had suffered  in exhaustion from all his long ordeals  the hero slept  meanwhile  athena went to the phaeacians  this people used to live in hyperia  a land of dancing  but their mighty neighbors  the cyclopes  kept looting them  and they could not hold out  their king  nausithous  brought them to scheria  a distant place  and built a wall around the town  and homes  and temples to the gods  and plots of land   he went to hades  then alcinous  who has god given wisdom  came to power  bright eyed athena traveled to his palace  to help odysseus  journey home  she went inside the decorated bedroom where the young princess  nausicaa  was sleeping  as lovely as a goddess  slaves were sleeping outside her doorway  one on either side  two charming girls with all the graces  gifts  the shining doors were shut  but like the wind  the goddess reached the bed of nausicaa  disguised as her best friend  a girl her age  the daughter of the famous sailor dymas  sharp eyed athena said   oh  nausicaa  so lazy  but your mother should have taught you  your clothes are lying there in dirty heaps  though you will soon be married  and you need a pretty dress to wear  and clothes to give to all your bridesmaids  that impresses people  and makes the parents happy  when day comes   we have to do the laundry  i will come and help you  so the work will soon be done  surely you will not long remain unmarried  the best young men here in your native land already want to court you  so at dawn go ask your father for the cart with mules  to carry dresses  scarves  and sheets  you should ride there  not walk  the washing pools are far from town   the goddess looked into her eyes  then went back to olympus  which they say  is where the gods will have their home forever  the place is never shaken by the wind  or wet with rain or blanketed by snow  a cloudless sky is spread above the mountain  white radiance all round  the blessed gods live there in happiness forevermore  then dawn came from her lovely throne  and woke the girl  she was amazed  remembering her dream  and in a fine dress  went to tell her

A magical kingdom odysseus sat patiently and prayed. meanwhile, the fine strong mules conveyed the girl to town; she reached her father s palace gate. her brothers gathered round her like immortals. they took the harness off the mules and brought the clothes inside. she went to her own room. eurymedusa, her old slave, had lit a fire for her. this woman had been brought from apeire by ship, long years before. the people chose to give her to the king,

Because they bowed before him like a god. she used to babysit young nausicaa, and now she lit her fire and cooked her meal. odysseus walked briskly to the town. athena helpfully surrounded him with mist that kept him safe him from rude remarks from people who might ask him who he was. when he had almost reached the lovely city, bright-eyed athena met him, like a girl, young and unmarried, with a water pitcher.

She stopped in front of him. odysseus said,  child, would you escort me to the house of king alcinous, who rules this land? i have been through hard times. i traveled here from far away; i am a foreigner, and i know no one who lives here in town or anywhere round here.  with twinkling eyes the goddess answered,  mr. foreigner, i will take you to where you want to go. the king lives near my father s home. but you

Must walk in silence. do not look at people, and ask no questions. people here are not too keen on strangers coming from abroad, although they like to cross the sea themselves. they know their ships go very fast. poseidon gave them this gift. their boats can fly like wings, or quick as thoughts.  the goddess led him there. he followed closely in her skipping steps. the seafaring phaeacians did not see him as he passed through the town, since that great goddess,

Pigtailed athena, in her care for him made him invisible with magic mist. he was amazed to see the ships and harbors and meeting places of the noblemen, and high walls set with stakes on top a wonder! they reached the splendid palace of the king. divine athena winked at him and said,  here, mr. foreigner, this is the house you wanted me to take you to. you will find them, the king and queen, inside at dinner.

Do not be scared; go in. the brave succeed in all adventures, even those who come from countries far away. first greet the queen. arete is her name. the king and queen have common ancestry nausithous. eurymedon was long ago the king over the giants, who were proud and bad. he killed them, his own people, and then he got killed as well. his youngest daughter was named periboea. she was very pretty.

Poseidon slept with her. she had a child, nausithous, and he became the king here in phaeacia, and he had two sons, our king alcinous, and rhexenor. apollo shot that rhexenor when he was newly married, with no son. he left a daughter, our arete, and her uncle, alcinous, made her his wife. no woman is honored as he honors her. she is precious to him, her children, and the people.

We look at her as if she were a goddess, and point her out when she walks through our town. she is extremely clever and perceptive; she solves disputes to help the men she likes. if she looks on you kindly in her heart, you have a chance of seeing those you love, and getting back again to your big house and homeland.  so bright-eyed athena left him. she went from lovely scheria, across the tireless sea, to marathon and athens,

And went inside erechtheus  palace. odysseus approached the royal house, and stood there by the threshold made of bronze. his heart was mulling over many things. the palace of the mighty king was high, and shone like rays of sunlight or of moonlight. the walls were bronze all over, from the entrance back to the bedrooms, and along them ran a frieze of blue. gold doors held safe the house. pillars of silver rose up from the threshold,

The lintel silver, and the handle, gold. silver and golden dogs stood at each side, made by hephaestus with great artistry, to guard the home of brave alcinous  immortal dogs, unaging for all time. at intervals were seats set in the walls, right from the doorway to the inner rooms, with soft embroidered throws, the work of women. phaeacian lords and ladies sat upon them, eating and drinking, since they lacked for nothing.

Boys made of gold were set on pedestals, and they held burning torches in their hands, lighting the hall at night for those at dinner. the king had fifty slave girls in his house; some ground the yellow grain upon the millstone, others wove cloth and sat there spinning yarn, with fingers quick as rustling poplar leaves, and oil was dripping from the woven fabric. just as phaeacian men have special talent for launching ships to sea, the women there

Are expert weavers, since athena gave them fine minds and skill to make most lovely things. outside the courtyard by the doors there grows an orchard of four acres, hedged around. the trees are tall, luxuriant with fruit: bright-colored apples, pears and pomegranate, sweet figs and fertile olives, and the crop never runs out or withers in the winter, nor in the summer. fruit grows all year round. the west wind always blows and makes it swell

And ripen: mellowing pear on mellowing pear, apple on apple, grapes on grapes, and figs. a fertile vineyard too is planted there. they use the warmer side, a flattened slope, for drying grapes in sunshine. they pick bunches and trample them, while unripe clusters open and shed their blooms, and others turn to purple. there are two springs: one flows all through the garden, the other gushes from the courtyard threshold, towards the palace, and the people draw

Freshwater. so the gods had blessed the house of king alcinous with lovely gifts. hardened, long-suffering odysseus stood there and stared, astonished in his heart, then quickly strode across the palace threshold. he found the lordly leaders of phaeacia pouring drink offerings for sharp-eyed hermes, to whom they give libations before bed. odysseus went in the house disguised in mist with which athena covered him,

Until he reached arete and the king. he threw his arms around arete s knees, and all at once, the magic mist dispersed. they were astonished when they saw the man, and all fell silent. then odysseus said,  queen arete, child of rhexenor, i have had many years of pain and loss. i beg you, and your husband, and these men who feast here may the gods bless you in life, and may you leave your children wealth and honor.

Now help me, please, to get back home, and quickly! i miss my family. i have been gone so long it hurts.  he sat down by the hearth among the ashes of the fire. they all were silent till echeneus spoke up. he was an elder statesman of phaeacia, a skillful orator and learned man. wanting to help, he said,  alcinous, you know it is not right to leave a stranger sitting there on the floor beside the hearth

Among the cinders. everyone is waiting for you to give the word. make him get up, and seat him on a silver chair, and order wine to be poured, so we may make libations to zeus the thunderlord, who loves the needy. the house girl ought to bring the stranger food out from the storeroom.  so alcinous reached for odysseus  hand, and raised the many-minded hero from the ashes. he made laodamas, his favorite son,

Vacate his chair so he could sit beside him. the slave girl brought him water in a pitcher of gold to wash his hands, and poured it out over a silver bowl, and fetched a table of polished wood; a humble slave brought out bread and an ample plateful of the meat. half-starved and weak, the hero ate and drank. majestic king alcinous addressed pontonous, the wine boy.  go and mix a bowl and serve the wine to all our guests,

So we may offer drink to thundering zeus who blesses those in need.  the boy mixed up the sweet, delicious wine, and filled the cups for everyone, with first pour for the gods. they made the offerings and drank as much as they desired, and then alcinous said,  listen, lords. hear what my heart commands. the feast is over; go home, go to bed. at dawn, we will call more of our best men, and host the stranger in our halls, and offer

Fine sacrifices to the gods, then plan how we may help his journey, so our guest may travel quickly, without pain or trouble, encountering no trouble on the way, however far away it is, until he reaches home. once there, he must endure whatever was spun out when he was born by fate and by the heavy ones, the spinners. but if he is immortal, come from heaven, the gods have changed their ways, since in the past

They used to show themselves to us directly whenever we would give them hecatombs. they sit and eat among us. even if just one of us meets them alone, out walking, they do not hide from us; we are close friends, as are the giants and cyclopic peoples.  odysseus, with careful calculation, said,  no, alcinous, please think again. i am not like the deathless gods in heaven. my height is normal. i look like a human.

In pain i am a match for any man, whoever you may know that suffers most. i could tell many stories of the dangers that i have suffered through; gods willed it so. but let me have my meal, despite my grief. the belly is just like a whining dog: it begs and forces one to notice it, despite exhaustion or the depths of sorrow. my heart is full of sorrow, but my stomach is always telling me to eat and drink.

It tells me to forget what i have suffered, and fill it up. at dawn tomorrow, help me to reach my homeland, after all this pain. may i live out my final days in sight of my own property and slaves and home.  they all agreed the stranger s words made sense, and that he should be sent back home. they poured drink offerings to the gods, and drank as much as they desired, then all went home to bed. odysseus was left there in the hall,

Sitting beside arete and the godlike alcinous. the dishes from the feast were cleaned up by the slaves. white-armed arete had noticed his fine clothes, the cloak and shirt she wove herself, with help from her slave girls. her words flew out to him as if on wings.  stranger, let me be first to speak to you. where are you from? and who gave you those clothes? i thought you said you drifted here by sea?  planning his words with careful skill, he answered,

 it would be difficult, your majesty, to tell it all; the gods have given me so many troubles. i will tell you this. there is an island, far out in the sea, ogygia, where the child of atlas lives, the mighty goddess with smooth braids, the crafty calypso, friend to neither gods nor mortals. a spirit brought me to her hearth, alone, when zeus scooped up my ship and with bright lightning split it apart across the wine-dark sea.

All of my comrades, my brave friends, were killed. i wrapped my arms around the keel and floated for ten days. on the tenth black night, the gods carried me till i reached ogygia, home of the beautiful and mighty goddess calypso. lovingly she cared for me, vowing to set me free from death and time forever. but she never swayed my heart. i stayed for seven years; she gave me clothes like those of gods, but they were always wet

With tears. at last the eighth year rolled around, and word came down from zeus that i must go, and finally her mind was changed. she sent me upon a well-bound wooden raft, equipped with food, sweet wine, and clothes as if for gods, and sent a fair warm wind. i sailed the sea for seventeen long days; on day eighteen, the murky mountains of your land appeared, and i was overjoyed, but more bad luck was hurled at me. poseidon roused the winds

To block me, and he stirred the sea. i sobbed, and clung there, going nowhere, till my raft was smashed to pieces by the massive storm. but i swam through this gulf of water till the current brought me here. if i had tried to land at once, i would have been swept back against the crags. i swam a way away, until i reached a river mouth, which seemed a perfect spot for landing: it was sheltered from wind, and smooth, quite free from rocks. so there

I flopped and tried to gather up my strength until the holy nightfall. then i crawled out of the rain-fed river to the bank, and hid inside the bushes, and i heaped some leaves to cover me. some god poured down deep sleep. with heavy heart i slept all night and through the dawn to noon, beneath the leaves. then in the afternoon, when sleep released me, i woke, and saw girls playing on the beach  your daughter, like a goddess, and her slaves.

I prayed to her. one would not think a girl as young as her would have so much good sense; young people are not usually so thoughtful. she was so kind to me; she gave me food and wine, and had them wash me in the river, and let me have these clothes. now i have told you the truth, no matter what.  alcinous said,  just one of these things that my daughter did was not correct: she should have brought you here to us herself, escorted by her slave girls,

Since you had supplicated first to her.  with careful tact odysseus replied,  your daughter is quite wonderful, great king. please do not blame her. she told me to come here with her slaves, but i was too embarrassed, and nervous. i thought you might get annoyed at seeing me. we humans on this earth are apt to be suspicious.  and the king replied,  my heart is not the type to feel anger for no good reason. moderation

Is always best. athena, zeus, apollo, what a congenial man you are! i wish you would stay here, and marry my own daughter, and be my son. i would give you a home and wealth if you would like to stay. if not, we will not keep you here against your will. may zeus not have it so! as for your journey, i give my word that you can go tomorrow. lying down, lulled to sleep, you will be rowed across the peaceful sea until you reach

Your land and home, or anywhere you want, even beyond euboea, which our people saw when they carried fair-haired rhadamanthus to visit tityus, the son of gaia. it is supposed to be the farthest shore on earth, but they were there and back that day, not even tired. that shows just how fine my ships are, and my men who stir the sea with oars.  at that odysseus, who had endured so much, was happy, and he prayed,

 o father zeus, may everything come true, just as alcinous has said. so may his fame burn bright forever on the earth, and may i reach my home.  then at these words, white-armed arete called to her attendants to put a bed out on the porch and lay fine purple blankets on it and to spread covers and woolly quilts across the top. with torches in their hands they bustled out. they made the bed up neatly, very fast,

Then came and called odysseus.  now guest, get up and come outside, your bed is ready.  odysseus was glad to go to sleep after his long adventures, on that bed surrounded by the rustling of the porch. alcinous was sleeping in his room, beside his wife, who made their bed and shared it.",a magical kingdom odysseus sat patiently and prayed  meanwhile  the fine strong mules conveyed the girl to town  she reached her father s palace gate  her brothers gathered round her like immortals  they took the harness off the mules and brought the clothes inside  she went to her own room  eurymedusa  her old slave  had lit a fire for her  this woman had been brought from apeire by ship  long years before  the people chose to give her to the king   because they bowed before him like a god  she used to babysit young nausicaa  and now she lit her fire and cooked her meal  odysseus walked briskly to the town  athena helpfully surrounded him with mist that kept him safe him from rude remarks from people who might ask him who he was  when he had almost reached the lovely city  bright eyed athena met him  like a girl  young and unmarried  with a water pitcher   she stopped in front of him  odysseus said   child  would you escort me to the house of king alcinous  who rules this land  i have been through hard times  i traveled here from far away  i am a foreigner  and i know no one who lives here in town or anywhere round here   with twinkling eyes the goddess answered   mr  foreigner  i will take you to where you want to go  the king lives near my father s home  but you  must walk in silence  do not look at people  and ask no questions  people here are not too keen on strangers coming from abroad  although they like to cross the sea themselves  they know their ships go very

The songs of a poet soon dawn appeared and touched the sky with roses. majestic, holy king alcinous leapt out of bed, as did odysseus, the city-sacker. then the blessed king, mighty alcinous, led out his guest to the phaeacian council by the ships. they sat there side by side on polished stones. meanwhile, athena walked all through the town, appearing like the royal messenger. to help odysseus  journey home,

She stood beside each man in turn and said,  my lord, come to the meeting place, to learn about the visitor to our king s home. despite his wanderings by sea, he looks like an immortal god.  so she roused up the hearts and minds of each, and soon the seats of council were filled up; the men assembled. seeing laertes  clever son, the crowd marveled. athena poured unearthly charm upon his head and shoulders, and she made him

Taller and sturdier, so these phaeacians would welcome and respect him, when he managed the many trials of skill that they would set to test him. when the people were assembled, alcinous addressed them.  hear me, leaders and chieftains of phaeacia. i will tell you the promptings of my heart. this foreigner  i do not know his name came wandering from west or east and showed up at my house. he begs and prays for help to travel on.

Let us assist him, as we have before with other guests: no visitor has ever been forced to linger in my house. we always give them safe passage home. now let us launch a ship for her maiden voyage on the water, and choose a crew of fifty-two, the men selected as the best, and lash the oars beside the benches. then return to shore, and come to my house. let the young men hurry to cook a feast. i will provide supplies,

Plenty for everyone. and i invite you also, lords, to welcome him with me. do not refuse! we also must invite demodocus, the poet. gods inspire him, so any song he chooses to perform is wonderful to hear.  he led the way. the lords went with him, and the house boy fetched the bard. the fifty-two select young men went to the shore, just as the king commanded. they reached the restless salty sea, and launched

The black ship on the depths, set up the mast and sails, and fastened in the oars, by tying each to its leather thole-strap, all in order. they spread the white sails wide, and moored the ship out in the water. then the men walked up towards the mighty palace of the king. the halls and porticoes were thronged with people, both old and young. to feed his many guests alcinous killed twelve sheep, and eight boars with silver tusks, and two slow-lumbering cows.

Skinning the animals, they cooked a feast. the house boy brought the poet, whom the muse adored. she gave him two gifts, good and bad: she took his sight away, but gave sweet song. the wine boy brought a silver-studded chair and propped it by a pillar, in the middle of all the guests, and by a peg he hung the poet s lyre above his head and helped him to reach it, and he set a table by him, and a bread basket and a cup of wine

To drink whenever he desired. they all took food. when they were satisfied, the muse prompted the bard to sing of famous actions, an episode whose fame has touched the sky: achilles  and odysseus  quarrel  how at a splendid sacrificial feast, they argued bitterly, and agamemnon was glad because the best of the achaeans were quarreling, since when he had consulted the oracle at pytho, crossing over

The entry stone, apollo had foretold that this would be the start of suffering for greeks and trojans, through the plans of zeus. so sang the famous bard. odysseus with his strong hands picked up his heavy cloak of purple, and he covered up his face. he was ashamed to let them see him cry. each time the singer paused, odysseus wiped tears, drew down the cloak and poured a splash of wine out of his goblet, for the gods.

But each time, the phaeacian nobles urged the bard to sing again they loved his songs. so he would start again; odysseus would moan and hide his head beneath his cloak. only alcinous could see his tears, since he was sitting next to him, and heard his sobbing. so he quickly spoke.  my lords! we have already satisfied our wish for feasting, and the lyre, the feast s companion. now let us go outside and set up contests

In every sport, so when our guest goes home he can tell all his friends we are the best at boxing, wrestling, high-jumping, and sprinting.  with that he led the way; the others followed. the boy took down the lyre from its peg and took demodocus  hand to lead him out with the crowd who went to watch the games. many young athletes stood there: acrone s, ocyalus, elatreus, nauteus, tho n, anchialus, eretmeus,

Anabesineus and ponteus, prymneus, proreus, amphialus, the son of polynaus, son of tecton, and naubolus  son, euryalus, like ares, cause of ruin. in his looks and strength, he was the best in all phaeacia, after laodamas. three sons of great alcinous stood up: laodamas, godlike clytoneus, and halius. first came the footrace. they lined up, then dashed

All in an instant, right around the track so fast they raised the dust up from the field. clytoneus was the best by far at sprinting: he raced past all the others by the length of a field plowed by mules, and reached the crowd. next came the brutal sport of wrestling, in which euryalus was best. in jumping, amphialus excelled. and at the discus, by far the best of all was elatreus. the prince laodamas excelled at boxing.

They all enjoyed the games. when they were over, laodamas, alcinous  son, said,  now my friends, we ought to ask the stranger if he plays any sports. his build is strong; his legs and arms and neck are very sturdy, and he is in his prime, though he has been broken by suffering. no pain can shake a man as badly as the sea, however strong he once was.  euryalus replied,  you are quite right, laodamas. why not

Call out to challenge him yourself?  the noble son of alcinous agreed with him. he stood up in the middle of them all and called odysseus.  come here!  he said.  now you, sir! you should try our games as well, if you know any sports; it seems you would. nothing can be more glorious for a man, in a whole lifetime, than what he achieves with hands and feet. so try, set care aside. soon you will travel, since your ship is launched.

The crew is standing by.  odysseus thought carefully he had a plan. he answered,  laodamas, why mock me with this challenge? my heart is set on sorrow, not on games, since i have suffered and endured so much that now i only want to get back home. i sit here praying to your king and people to grant my wish.  euryalus responded with outright taunting.  stranger, i suppose you must be ignorant of all athletics.

I know your type. the captain of a crew of merchant sailors, you roam round at sea and only care about your freight and cargo, keeping close watch on your ill-gotten gains. you are no athlete.  with a scowl, he answered,  what crazy arrogance from you, you stranger! the gods do not bless everyone the same, with equal gifts of body, mind, or speech. one man is weak, but gods may crown his words with loveliness. men gladly look to him;

His speech is steady, with calm dignity. he stands out from his audience, and when he walks through town, the people look at him as if he were a god. another man has godlike looks but no grace in his words. like you you look impressive, and a god could not improve your body. but your mind is crippled. you have stirred my heart to anger with these outrageous comments. i am not lacking experience of sports and games.

When i was young, i trusted my strong arms and was among the first. now pain has crushed me. i have endured the agonies of war, and struggled through the dangers of the sea. but you have challenged me and stung my heart. despite my suffering, i will compete.  with that he leapt up, cloak and all, and seized a massive discus, heavier than that used by the others. he spun around, drew back his arm and from his brawny hand he hurled.

The stone went humming. the phaeacians, known for rowing, ducked down cowering beneath its arc; it flew beyond the other pegs. athena marked the spot. in human guise she spoke.  a blind man, stranger, could discern this mark by groping. it is far ahead of all the others. you can celebrate! you won this round, and none of them will ever throw further or as far!  odysseus was thrilled to realize he had a friend

To take his side, and with a lighter heart, he told the young phaeacians,  try to match this! if you can do it, i will throw another, as far or farther. you have made me angry, so i will take you on in any sport. come on! in boxing, wrestling, or sprinting, i will compete with anyone, except laodamas: he is my host. who would fight with a friend? a man who challenges those who have welcomed him in a strange land

Is worthless and a fool; he spites himself. but i will challenge any of you others. test my ability, let me know yours. i am not weak at any sport men practice. i know the way to hold a polished bow. i always was the first to hit my man out of a horde of enemies, though many comrades stood by me, arrows taking aim. at troy, when the achaeans shot their bows, the only one superior to me

Was philoctetes. other men who eat their bread on earth are all worse shots than me. but i will not compete with super-archers, with heracles or eurytus, who risked competing with the gods at archery. apollo was enraged at him and killed him as soon as he proposed it. he died young and did not reach old age in his own home. and i can throw a spear beyond the shots that others reach with arrows. i am only

Concerned that one of you may win the footrace: i lost my stamina and my legs weakened during my time at sea, upon the raft; i could not do my exercise routine.  the crowd was silent, but alcinous said,  sir, you have expressed, with fine good manners, your wish to show your talents, and your anger at that man who stood up in this arena and mocked you, as no one who understands how to speak properly would ever do.

Now listen carefully, so you may tell your own fine friends at home when you are feasting beside your wife and children, and remember our skill in all the deeds we have accomplished from our forefathers  time till now. we are not brilliant at wrestling or boxing, but we are quick at sprinting, and with ships we are the best. we love the feast, the lyre, dancing and varied clothes, hot baths and bed. but now let the best dancers of phaeacia

Perform, so that our guest may tell his friends when he gets home, how excellent we are at seafaring, at running, and at dancing and song. let someone bring the well-tuned lyre from inside for demodocus go quickly!  so spoke the king. the house boy brought the lyre. the people chose nine referees to check the games were fair. they leveled out a floor for dancing, with a fine wide ring around. the house boy gave demodocus the lyre.

He walked into the middle, flanked by boys, young and well trained, who tapped their feet performing the holy dance, their quick legs bright with speed. odysseus was wonder-struck to see it. the poet strummed and sang a charming song about the love of fair-crowned aphrodite for ares, who gave lavish gifts to her and shamed the bed of lord hephaestus, where they secretly had sex. the sun god saw them, and told hephaestus bitter news for him.

He marched into his forge to get revenge, and set the mighty anvil on its block, and hammered chains so strong that they could never be broken or undone. he was so angry at ares. when his trap was made, he went inside the room of his beloved bed, and twined the mass of cables all around the bedposts, and then hung them from the ceiling, like slender spiderwebs, so finely made that nobody could see them, even gods:

The craftsmanship was so ingenious. when he had set that trap across the bed, he traveled to the cultured town of lemnos, which was his favorite place in all the world. ares the golden rider had kept watch. he saw hephaestus, famous wonder-worker, leaving his house, and went inside himself; he wanted to make love with aphrodite. she had returned from visiting her father, the mighty son of cronus; there she sat.

Then ares took her hand and said to her,  my darling, let us go to bed. hephaestus is out of town; he must have gone to lemnos to see the sintians whose speech is strange.  she was excited to lie down with him; they went to bed together. but the chains ingenious hephaestus had created wrapped tight around them, so they could not move or get up. then they knew that they were trapped. the limping god drew near before he reached

The land of lemnos, he had turned back home. troubled at heart, he came towards his house. standing there in the doorway, he was seized by savage rage. he gave a mighty shout, calling to all the gods,  o father zeus, and all you blessed gods who live forever, look! you may laugh, but it is hard to bear. see how my aphrodite, child of zeus, is disrespecting me for being lame. she loves destructive ares, who is strong

And handsome. i am weak. i blame my parents. if only i had not been born! but come, see where those two are sleeping in my bed, as lovers. i am horrified to see it. but i predict they will not want to lie longer like that, however great their love. soon they will want to wake up, but my trap and chains will hold them fast, until her father pays back the price i gave him for his daughter. her eyes stare at me like a dog. she is

So beautiful, but lacking self-control.  the gods assembled at his house: poseidon, earth-shaker, helpful hermes, and apollo. the goddesses stayed home, from modesty. the blessed gods who give good things were standing inside the doorway, and they burst out laughing, at what a clever trap hephaestus set. and as they looked, they said to one another,  crime does not pay! the slow can beat the quick, as now hephaestus, who is lame and slow,

Has used his skill to catch the fastest sprinter of all those on olympus. ares owes the price for his adultery.  they gossiped. apollo, son of zeus, then said to hermes,  hermes my brother, would you like to sleep with golden aphrodite, in her bed, even weighed down by mighty chains?  and hermes the sharp-eyed messenger replied,  ah, brother, apollo lord of archery: if only! i would be bound three times as tight or more

And let you gods and all your wives look on, if only i could sleep with aphrodite.  then laughter rose among the deathless gods. only poseidon did not laugh. he begged and pleaded with hephaestus to release ares. he told the wonder-working god,  now let him go! i promise he will pay the penalty in full among the gods, just as you ask.  the famous limping god replied,  poseidon, do not ask me this.

It is disgusting, bailing scoundrels out. how could i bind you, while the gods look on, if ares should escape his bonds and debts?  poseidon, lord of earthquakes, answered him,  hephaestus, if he tries to dodge this debt, i promise i will pay.  the limping god said,  then, in courtesy to you, i must do as you ask.  so using all his strength, hephaestus loosed the chains. the pair of lovers were free from their constraints, and both jumped up.

Ares went off to thrace, while aphrodite smiled as she went to cyprus, to the island of paphos, where she had a fragrant altar and sanctuary. the graces washed her there, and rubbed her with the magic oil that glows upon immortals, and they dressed her up in gorgeous clothes. she looked astonishing. that was the poet s song. odysseus was happy listening; so were they all. and then alcinous told halius

To dance with laodamas; no one danced as well as them. they took a purple ball which polybus the artisan had made them. one boy would leap and toss it to the clouds; the other would jump up, feet off the ground, and catch it easily before he landed. after they practiced throwing it straight upwards, they danced across the fertile earth, crisscrossing, constantly trading places. other boys who stood around the field were beating time

With noisy stomping. then odysseus said,  king of many citizens, great lord, you boasted that your dancers are the best, and it is true. i feel amazed to see this marvelous show.  that pleased the reverend king. he spoke at once to his seafaring people.  hear me, phaeacian leaders, lords and nobles. the stranger seems extremely wise to me. so let us give him gifts, as hosts should do to guests in friendship. twelve lords rule our people,

With me as thirteenth lord. let us each bring a pound of precious gold and laundered clothes, a tunic and a cloak. then pile them up, and let our guest take all these gifts, and go to dinner with them, happy in his heart. euryalus should tell him he is sorry, and give a special gift, since what he said was inappropriate.  they all agreed, and each sent back a deputy to fetch the presents. and euryalus spoke out.

 my lord alcinous, great king of kings, i will apologize, as you command. and i will give him this bronze sword which has a silver handle, and a scabbard carved of ivory a precious gift for him.  with that he put the silver-studded sword into odysseus  hands; his words flew out.  i welcome you, sir. be our guest. if something rude of any kind was said, let the winds take it. may the gods allow you

To reach your home and see your wife again, since you have suffered so long, far away from those who love you.  and odysseus said,  friend, i wish you well. may gods protect you, and may you never miss the sword you gave me.  with that, he strapped the silver-studded sword across his back, and as the sun went down the precious gifts were brought to him. the slaves took them inside alcinous  house. the princes piled the lovely things beside

The queen, their mother. king alcinous led everyone inside and had them sit on upright chairs. he told arete,  wife, bring out our finest chest, and put inside it a tunic and a freshly laundered cloak. set a bronze cauldron on the fire to boil, so he can take a bath. then let him see the precious gifts our noblemen have brought, and then enjoy the banquet and the song. i also have a gift: a splendid cup

Of gold. i hope he always thinks of me whenever he pours offerings to zeus and other gods.  arete told her slaves to quickly set a mighty pot to warm, for washing. so upon the blazing flames they set the cauldron and poured water in, and heaped up wood. the fire licked around the belly of the tub and warmed the water. arete brought from her own room a chest to give the guest, and packed the gifts inside 

The clothes and gold that they had given him; and she herself put in a cloak and tunic. she told him,  watch the lid, and tie it closed, so nobody can rob you as you travel, when you are lulled to sleep on your black ship.  odysseus, experienced in loss, took careful note. he shut the lid and tied a cunning knot that he had learned from circe. then right away the slave girl led him off towards the bath to wash. he was delighted

To see hot water. he had not been bathed since he had left the home of curly-haired calypso, who had taken care of him as if he were a god. the slave girls washed him, rubbed oil on him and dressed him in a tunic and fine wool mantle. freshly bathed, he joined the men at wine. and there stood nausicaa, divinely beautiful, beside a pillar that held the palace roof. she was amazed to see odysseus. her words flew fast.

 good-bye then, stranger, but remember me when you reach home, because you owe your life to me. i helped you first.  odysseus replied politely,  nausicaa, may zeus, husband of hera, mighty lord of thunder, allow me to go back and see my home. there i shall pray to you as to a god, forever, princess, since you saved my life.  with that he went to sit beside the king. now they were serving out the food and pouring

Wine, and the steward led out to the center demodocus, the well-respected poet. he sat him in the middle of the banquet, against a pillar. then odysseus thought fast, and sliced a helping from the pig, all richly laced with fat. the plate of meat had plenty left. he told the boy,  go take this meat and give it to demodocus. despite my grief, i would be glad to meet him. poets are honored by all those who live

On earth. the muse has taught them how to sing; she loves the race of poets.  so the house boy handed it to demodocus. he took it gladly; and everybody took their food. when they had had enough to eat and drink, the clever mastermind of many schemes said,  you are wonderful, demodocus! i praise you more than anyone; apollo, or else the muse, the child of zeus, has taught you. you tell so accurately what the greeks

Achieved, and what they suffered, there at troy, as if you had been there, or heard about it from somebody who was. so sing the story about the wooden horse, which epeius built with athena s help. odysseus dragged it inside and to the citadel, filled up with men to sack the town. if you can tell that as it happened, i will say that you truly are blessed with inspiration.  a god inspired the bard to sing. he started

With how the greeks set fire to their camp and then embarked and sailed away. meanwhile, odysseus brought in a gang of men into the heart of troy, inside the horse. the trojans pulled the thing up to the summit, and sat around discussing what to do. some said,  we ought to strike the wood with swords!  others said,  drag it higher up and hurl it down from the rocks!  but some said they should leave it to pacify the gods. so it would be.

The town was doomed to ruin when it took that horse, chock-full of fighters bringing death to trojans. and he sang how the achaeans poured from the horse, in ambush from the hollow, and sacked the city; how they scattered out, destroying every neighborhood. like ares, odysseus, with menelaus, rushed to find deiphobus  house, and there he won at last, through dreadful violence, thanks to athena. so the poet sang.

Odysseus was melting into tears; his cheeks were wet with weeping, as a woman weeps, as she falls to wrap her arms around her husband, fallen fighting for his home and children. she is watching as he gasps and dies. she shrieks, a clear high wail, collapsing upon his corpse. the men are right behind. they hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her to slavery, hard labor, and a life of pain. her face is marked with her despair.

In that same desperate way, odysseus was crying. no one noticed that his eyes were wet with tears, except alcinous, who sat right next to him and heard his sobs. quickly he spoke to his seafaring people.  listen, my lords and nobles of phaeacia! demodocus should stop and set aside the lyre, since what he sings does not give pleasure to everyone. throughout this heavenly song, since dinnertime, our guest has been in pain,

Grieving. a heavy burden weighs his heart. let the song end, so we can all be happy, both guest and hosts. that would be best by far. this send-off party and these precious gifts, which we give out of friendship, are for him, our guest of honor. any man of sense will treat a guest in need like his own brother. stranger, now answer all my questions clearly, not with evasion; frankness would be best. what did your parents name you? with what name

Are you known to your people? surely no one in all the world is nameless, poor or noble, since parents give a name to every child at birth. and also tell me of your country, your people, and your city, so our ships, steered by their own good sense, may take you there. phaeacians have no need of men at helm nor rudders, as in other ships. our boats intuit what is in the minds of men, and know all human towns and fertile fields.

They rush at full tilt right across the gulf of salty sea, concealed in mist and clouds. they have no fear of damages or loss. but once i heard nausithous, my father, say that poseidon hates us for the help we give to take our guests across the sea, and that one day a ship of ours would suffer shipwreck on its return; a mighty mountain would block our town from sight. so father said. perhaps the god will bring these things to pass

Or not, as is his will. but come now, tell me about your wanderings: describe the places, the people, and the cities you have seen. which ones were wild and cruel, unwelcoming, and which were kind to visitors, respecting the gods? and please explain why you were crying, sobbing your heart out when you heard him sing what happened to the greeks at troy. the gods devised and measured out this devastation, to make a song for those in times to come.

Did you lose somebody at troy? a man from your wife s family, perhaps her father or brother? ties of marriage are the closest after the bonds of blood. or else perhaps you lost the friend who knew you best of all? a friend can be as close as any brother.",the songs of a poet soon dawn appeared and touched the sky with roses  majestic  holy king alcinous leapt out of bed  as did odysseus  the city

will compete with anyone  except laodamas  he is my host  who would fight with a friend  a man who challenges those who have welcomed him in a strange land  is worthless and a fool  he spites himself  but i will challenge any of you others  test my ability  let me know yours  i am not weak at any sport men practice  i know the way to hold a polished bow  i always was the first to hit my man out of a horde of enemies  though many comrades stood by me  arrows taking aim  at troy  when the achaeans shot their bows  the only one superior to me  was philoctetes  other men who eat their bread on earth are all worse shots than me  but i will not compete with super archers  with heracles or eurytus  who risked competing with the gods at archery  apollo was enraged at him and killed him as soon as he proposed it  he died young and did not reach old age in his own home  and i can throw a spear beyond the shots that others reach with arrows  i am only  concerned that one of you may win the footrace  i lost my stamina and my legs weakened during my time at sea  upon the raft  i could not do my exercise routine   the crowd was silent  but alcinous said   sir  you have expressed  with fine good manners  your wish to show your talents  and your anger at that man who stood up in this arena and mocked you  as no one who understands how to speak properly would ever do   now listen carefully  so you may tell your own fine friends at home when you are feasting beside your wife and children  and remember our skill in all the deeds we have accomplished from our forefathers  time till now  we are not brilliant at wrestling or boxing  but we are quick at sprinting  and with ships we are the best  we love the feast  the lyre  dancing and varied clothes  hot baths and bed  but now let the best dancers of phaeacia  perform  so that our guest may tell his friends when he gets home  how excellent we are at seafaring  at running  and at dancing and song  let someone bring the well tuned lyre from inside for demodocus go quickly   so spoke the king  the house boy brought the lyre  the people chose nine referees to check the games were fair  they leveled out a floor for dancing  with a fine wide ring around  the house boy gave demodocus the lyre   he walked into the middle  flanked by boys  young and well trained  who tapped their feet performing the holy dance  their quick legs bright with speed  odysseus was wonder struck to see it  the poet strummed and sang a charming song about the love of fair crowned aphrodite for ares  who gave lavish gifts to her and shamed the bed of lord hephaestus  where they secretly had sex  the sun god saw them  and told hephaestus bitter news for him   he marched into his forge to get revenge  and set the mighty anvil on its block  and hammered chains so strong that they could never be broken or undone  he was so angry at ares  when his trap was made  he went inside the room of his beloved bed  and twined the mass of cables all around the bedposts  and then hung them from the ceiling  like slender spiderwebs  so finely made that nobody could see them  even gods   the craftsmanship was so ingenious  when he had set that trap across the bed  he traveled to the cultured town of lemnos  which was his favorite place in all the world  ares the golden rider had kept watch  he saw hephaestus  famous wonder worker  leaving his house  and went inside himself  he wanted to make love with aphrodite  she had returned from visiting her father  the mighty son of cronus  there she sat   then ares took her hand and said to her   my darling  let us go to bed  hephaestus is out of town  he must have gone to lemnos to see the sintians whose speech is strange   she was excited to lie down with him  they went to bed together  but the chains ingenious hephaestus had created wrapped tight around them  so they could not move or get up  then they knew that they were trapped  the limping god drew near before he reached  the land of lemnos  he had turned back home  troubled at heart  he came towards his house  standing there in the doorway  he was seized by savage rage  he gave a mighty shout  calling to all the gods   o father zeus  and all you blessed gods who live forever  look  you may laugh  but it is hard to bear  see how my aphrodite  child of zeus  is disrespecting me for being lame  she loves destructive ares  who is strong  and handsome  i am weak  i blame my parents  if only i had not been born  but come  see where those two are sleeping in my bed  as lovers  i am horrified to see it  but i predict they will not want to lie longer like that  however great their love  soon they will want to wake up  but my trap and chains will hold them fast  until her father pays back the price i gave him for his daughter  her eyes stare at me like a dog  she is  so beautiful  but lacking self control   the gods assembled at his house  poseidon  earth shaker  helpful hermes  and apollo  the goddesses stayed home  from modesty  the blessed gods who give good things were standing inside the doorway  and they burst out laughing  at what a clever trap hephaestus set  and as they looked  they said to one another   crime does not pay  the slow can beat the quick  as now hephaestus  who is lame and slow   has used his skill to catch the fastest sprinter of all those on olympus  ares owes the price for his adultery   they gossiped  apollo  son of zeus  then said to hermes   hermes my brother  would you like to sleep with golden aphrodite  in her bed  even weighed down by mighty chains   and hermes the sharp eyed messenger replied   ah  brother  apollo lord of archery  if only  i would be bound three times as tight or more  and let you gods and all your wives look on  if only i could sleep with aphrodite   then laughter rose among the deathless gods  only poseidon did not laugh  he begged and pleaded with hephaestus to release ares  he told the wonder working god   now let him go  i promise he will pay the penalty in full among the gods  just as you ask   the famous limping god replied   poseidon  do not ask me this   it is disgusting  bailing scoundrels out  how could i bind you  while the gods look on  if ares should escape his bonds and debts   poseidon  lord of earthquakes  answered him   hephaestus  if he tries to dodge this debt  i promise i will pay   the limping god said   then  in courtesy to you  i must do as you ask   so using all his strength  hephaestus loosed the chains  the pair of lovers were free from their constraints  and both jumped up   ares went off to thrace  while aphrodite smiled as she went to cyprus  to the island of paphos  where she had a fragrant altar and sanctuary  the graces washed her there  and rubbed her with the magic oil that glows upon immortals  and they dressed her up in gorgeous clothes  she looked astonishing  that was the poet s song  odysseus was happy listening  so were they all  and then alcinous told halius  to dance with laodamas  no one danced as well as them  they took a purple ball which polybus the artisan had made them  one boy would leap and toss it to the clouds  the other would jump up  feet off the ground  and catch it easily before he landed  after they practiced throwing it straight upwards  they danced across the fertile earth  crisscrossing  constantly trading places  other boys who stood around the field were beating time  with noisy stomping  then odysseus said   king of many citizens  great lord  you boasted that your dancers are the best  and it is true  i feel amazed to see this marvelous show   that pleased the reverend king  he spoke at once to his seafaring people   hear me  phaeacian leaders  lords and nobles  the stranger seems extremely wise to me  so let us give him gifts  as hosts should do to guests in friendship  twelve lords rule our people   with me as thirteenth lord  let us each bring a pound of precious gold and laundered clothes  a tunic and a cloak  then pile them up  and let our guest take all these gifts  and go to dinner with them  happy in his heart  euryalus should tell him he is sorry  and give a special gift  since what he said was inappropriate   they all agreed  and each sent back a deputy to fetch the presents  and euryalus spoke out    my lord alcinous  great king of kings  i will apologize  as you command  and i will give him this bronze sword which has a silver handle  and a scabbard carved of ivory a precious gift for him   with that he put the silver studded sword into odysseus  hands  his words flew out   i welcome you  sir  be our guest  if something rude of any kind was said  let the winds take it  may the gods allow you  to reach your home and see your wife again  since you have suffered so long  far away from those who love you   and odysseus said   friend  i wish you well  may gods protect you  and may you never miss the sword you gave me   with that  he strapped the silver studded sword across his back  and as the sun went down the precious gifts were brought to him  the slaves took them inside alcinous  house  the princes piled the lovely things beside  the queen  their mother  king alcinous led everyone inside and had them sit on upright chairs  he told arete   wife  bring out our finest chest  and put inside it a tunic and a freshly laundered cloak  set a bronze cauldron on the fire to boil  so he can take a bath  then let him see the precious gifts our noblemen have brought  and then enjoy the banquet and the song  i also have a gift  a splendid cup  of gold  i hope he always thinks of me whenever he pours offerings to zeus and other gods   arete told her slaves to quickly set a mighty pot to warm  for washing  so upon the blazing flames they set the cauldron and poured water in  and heaped up wood  the fire licked around the belly of the tub and warmed the water  arete brought from her own room a chest to give the guest  and packed the gifts inside   the clothes and gold that they had given him  and she herself put in a cloak and tunic  she told him   watch the lid  and tie it closed  so nobody can rob you as you travel  when you are lulled to sleep on your black ship   odysseus  experienced in loss  took careful note  he shut the lid and tied a cunning knot that he had learned from circe  then right away the slave girl led him off towards the bath to wash  he was delighted  to see hot water  he had not been bathed since he had left the home of curly haired calypso  who had taken care of him as if he were a god  the slave girls washed him  rubbed oil on him and dressed him in a tunic and fine wool mantle  freshly bathed  he joined the men at wine  and there stood nausicaa  divinely beautiful  beside a pillar that held the palace roof  she was amazed to see odysseus  her words flew fast    good bye then  stranger  but remember me when you reach home  because you owe your life to me  i helped you first   odysseus replied politely   nausicaa  may zeus  husband of hera  mighty lord of thunder  allow me to go back and see my home  there i shall pray to you as to a god  forever  princess  since you saved my life   with that he went to sit beside the king  now they were serving out the food and pouring  wine  and the steward led out to the center demodocus  the well respected poet  he sat him in the middle of the banquet  against a pillar  then odysseus thought fast  and sliced a helping from the pig  all richly laced with fat  the plate of meat had plenty left  he told the boy   go take this meat and give it to demodocus  despite my grief  i would be glad to meet him  poets are honored by all those who live  on earth  the muse has taught them how to sing  she loves the race of poets   so the house boy handed it to demodocus  he took it gladly  and everybody took their food  when they had had enough to eat and drink  the clever mastermind of many schemes said   you are wonderful  demodocus  i praise you more than anyone  apollo  or else the muse  the child of zeus  has taught you  you tell so accurately what the greeks  achieved  and what they suffered  there at troy  as if you had been there  or heard about it from somebody who was  so sing the story about the wooden horse  which epeius built with athena s help  odysseus dragged it inside and to the citadel  filled up with men to sack the town  if you can tell that as it happened  i will say that you truly are blessed with inspiration   a god inspired the bard to sing  he started  with how the greeks set fire to their camp and then embarked and sailed away  meanwhile  odysseus brought in a gang of men into the heart of troy  inside the horse  the trojans pulled the thing up to the summit  and sat around discussing what to do  some said   we ought to strike the wood with swords   others said   drag it higher up and hurl it down from the rocks   but some said they should leave it to pacify the gods  so it would be   the town was doomed to ruin when it took that horse  chock full of fighters bringing death to trojans  and he sang how the achaeans poured from the horse  in ambush from the hollow  and sacked the city  how they scattered out  destroying every neighborhood  like ares  odysseus  with menelaus  rushed to find deiphobus  house  and there he won at last  through dreadful violence  thanks to athena  so the poet sang   odysseus was melting into tears  his cheeks were wet with weeping  as a woman weeps  as she falls to wrap her arms around her husband  fallen fighting for his home and children  she is watching as he gasps and dies  she shrieks  a clear high wail  collapsing upon his corpse  the men are right behind  they hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her to slavery  hard labor  and a life of pain  her face is marked with her despair   in that same desperate way  odysseus was crying  no one noticed that his eyes were wet with tears  except alcinous  who sat right next to him and heard his sobs  quickly he spoke to his seafaring people   listen  my lords and nobles of phaeacia  demodocus should stop and set aside the lyre  since what he sings does not give pleasure to everyone  throughout this heavenly song  since dinnertime  our guest has been in pain   grieving  a heavy burden weighs his heart  let the song end  so we can all be happy  both guest and hosts  that would be best by far  this send off party and these precious gifts  which we give out of friendship  are for him  our guest of honor  any man of sense will treat a guest in need like his own brother  stranger  now answer all my questions clearly  not with evasion  frankness would be best  what did your parents name you  with what name  are you known to your people  surely no one in all the world is nameless  poor or noble  since parents give a name to every child at birth  and also tell me of your country  your people  and your city  so our ships  steered by their own good sense  may take you there  phaeacians have no need of men at helm nor rudders  as in other ships  our boats intuit what is in the minds of men  and know all human towns and fertile fields   they rush at full tilt right across the gulf of salty sea  concealed in mist and clouds  they have no fear of damages or loss  but once i heard nausithous  my father  say that poseidon hates us for the help we give to take our guests across the sea  and that one day a ship of ours would suffer shipwreck on its return  a mighty mountain would block our town from sight  so father said  perhaps the god will bring these things to pass  or not  as is his will  but come now  tell me about your wanderings  describe the places  the people  and the cities you have seen  which ones were wild and cruel  unwelcoming  and which were kind to visitors  respecting the gods  and please explain why you were crying  sobbing your heart out when you heard him sing what happened to the greeks at troy  the gods devised and measured out this devastation  to make a song for those in times to come   did you lose somebody at troy  a man from your wife s family  perhaps her father or brother  ties of marriage are the closest after the bonds of blood  or else perhaps you lost the friend who knew you best of all  a friend can be as close as any

A pirate in a shepherd s cave wily odysseus, the lord of lies, answered,  my lord alcinous, great king, it is a splendid thing to hear a poet as talented as this. his voice is godlike. i think that there can be no greater pleasure than when the whole community enjoys a banquet, as we sit inside the house, and listen to the singer, and the tables are heaped with bread and meat; the wine boy ladles drink from the bowl and pours it into cups.

To me this seems ideal, a thing of beauty. now something prompted you to ask about my own sad story. i will tell you, though the memory increases my despair. where shall i start? where can i end? the gods have given me so much to cry about. first i will tell my name, so we will be acquainted and if i survive, you can be my guest in my distant home one day. i am odysseus, laertes  son,

Known for my many clever tricks and lies. my fame extends to heaven, but i live in ithaca, where shaking forest hides mount neriton. close by are other islands: dulichium, and wooded zacynthus and same. all the others face the dawn; my ithaca is set apart, most distant, facing the dark. it is a rugged land, but good at raising children. to my eyes no country could be sweeter. as you know,

Divine calpyso held me in her cave, wanting to marry me; and likewise circe, the trickster, trapped me, and she wanted me to be her husband. but she never swayed my heart, since when a man is far from home, living abroad, there is no sweeter thing than his own native land and family. now let me tell you all the trouble zeus has caused me on my journey home from troy. a blast of wind pushed me off course towards

The cicones in ismarus. i sacked the town and killed the men. we took their wives and shared their riches equally among us. then i said we must run away. those fools refused to listen. they were drinking wine excessively, and killing sheep and cattle along the beach. the cicones called out to neighbors on the mainland, who were strong and numerous, and skilled at horseback fighting, and if need be, on foot. they came like leaves

And blossoms in the spring at dawn. then zeus gave us bad luck. poor us! the enemy assembled round the ships and fought with swords of bronze. and while the holy morning light was bright and strong, we held them off, though they outnumbered us. but when the sun turned round and dipped, the hour when oxen are released, the cicones began to overpower us greeks. six well-armed members of my crew died from each ship. the rest of us survived,

And we escaped the danger. we prepared to sail away with heavy hearts, relieved to be alive, but grieving for our friends. before we launched the ships, we called aloud three times to each of our poor lost companions, slaughtered at the hands of the cicones. the cloud lord zeus hurled north wind at our ships, a terrible typhoon, and covered up the sea and earth with fog. night fell from heaven and seized us and our ships keeled over sideways;

The sails were ripped three times by blasting wind. scared for our lives, we hoisted down the sails and rowed with all our might towards the shore. we stayed there for two days and nights, exhausted, eating our hearts with pain. when bright-haired dawn brought the third morning, we set up our masts, unfurled the shining sails, and climbed aboard. the wind blew straight, the pilots steered, and i would have come safely home, to my own land, but as i rounded malea, a current

And blast of wind pushed me off course, away from cythera. for nine days i was swept by stormy winds across the fish-filled sea. on the tenth day, i landed on the island of those who live on food from lotus flowers. we gathered water, and my crew prepared a meal. we picnicked by the ships, then i chose two men, and one slave to make the third, to go and scout. we needed to find out what kind of people lived there on that island.

The scouts encountered humans, lotus-eaters, who did not hurt them. they just shared with them their sweet delicious fruit. but as they ate it, they lost the will to come back and bring news to me. they wanted only to stay there, feeding on lotus with the lotus-eaters. they had forgotten home. i dragged them back in tears, forced them on board the hollow ships, pushed them below the decks, and tied them up. i told the other men, the loyal ones,

To get back in the ships, so no one else would taste the lotus and forget about our destination. they embarked and sat along the rowing benches, side by side, and struck the grayish water with their oars. with heavy hearts we sailed along and reached the country of high-minded cyclopes, the mavericks. they put their trust in gods, and do not plant their food from seed, nor plow, and yet the barley, grain, and clustering wine-grapes

All flourish there, increased by rain from zeus. they hold no councils, have no common laws, but live in caves on lofty mountaintops, and each makes laws for his own wife and children, without concern for what the others think. a distance from this island is another, across the water, slantways from the harbor, level and thickly wooded. countless goats live there but people never visit it. no hunters labor through its woods to scale

Its hilly peaks. there are no flocks of sheep, no fields of plowland it is all untilled, unsown and uninhabited by humans. only the bleating goats live there and graze. cyclopic people have no red-cheeked ships and no shipwright among them who could build boats, to enable them to row across to other cities, as most people do, crossing the sea to visit one another. with boats they could have turned this island into

A fertile colony, with proper harvests. by the gray shore there lie well-watered meadows, where vines would never fail. there is flat land for plowing, and abundant crops would grow in the autumn; there is richness underground. the harbor has good anchorage; there is no need of anchor stones or ropes or cables. the ships that come to shore there can remain beached safely till the sailors wish to leave and fair winds blow. up by the harbor head

Freshwater gushes down beneath the caves. the poplars grow around it. there we sailed: the gods were guiding us all through the darkness. thick fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky the moon was dark and clothed in clouds, so we saw nothing of the island. none of us could see the great waves rolling in towards the land, until we rowed right to the beach. we lowered all the sails and disembarked onto the shore, and there we fell asleep.

When early dawn shone forth with rosy fingers, we roamed around that island full of wonders. the daughters of the great king zeus, the nymphs, drove out the mountain goats so that my crew could eat. on seeing them, we dashed to fetch our javelins and bows from on board ship. we split into three groups, took aim and shot. some god gave us good hunting. all twelve crews had nine goats each, and ten for mine. we sat there all day till sunset, eating meat and drinking

Our strong red wine. the ships  supply of that had not run out; when we had sacked the holy citadel of the cicones, we all took gallons of it, poured in great big pitchers. we looked across the narrow strip of water at the cyclopic island, saw their smoke, and heard the baaing of their sheep and goats. the sun went down and in the hours of darkness we lay and slept on shore beside the sea. but when the rosy hands of dawn appeared,

I called my men together and addressed them.  my loyal friends! stay here, the rest of you, while with my boat and crew i go to check who those men are, find out if they are wild, lawless aggressors, or the type to welcome strangers, and fear the gods.  with that, i climbed on board and told my crew to come with me and then untie the cables of the ship. quickly they did so, sat along the benches, and struck the whitening water with their oars.

The journey was not long. upon arrival, right at the edge of land, beside the sea, we saw a high cave overhung with laurel, the home of several herds of sheep and goats. around that cave was built a lofty courtyard, of deep-set stones, with tall pines rising up, and leafy oaks. there lived a massive man who shepherded his flocks all by himself. he did not go to visit other people, but kept apart, and did not know the ways

Of custom. in his build he was a wonder, a giant, not like men who live on bread, but like a wooded peak in airy mountains, rising alone above the rest. i told my loyal crew to guard the ship, while i would go with just twelve chosen men, my favorites. i took a goatskin full of dark sweet wine that i was given by apollo s priest, maron the son of euanthes, who lived inside the shady grove on ismarus.

In reverence to the god, i came to help him, and save his wife and son. he gave me gifts: a silver bowl and seven pounds of gold, well wrought, and siphoned off some sweet strong wine, and filled twelve jars for me a godlike drink. the slaves knew nothing of this wine; it was known just to him, his wife, and one house girl. whenever he was drinking it, he poured a single shot into a cup, and added twenty of water, and a marvelous smell

Rose from the bowl, and all would long to taste it. i filled a big skin up with it, and packed provisions in a bag my heart suspected that i might meet a man of courage, wild, and lacking knowledge of the normal customs. we soon were at the cave, but did not find the cyclops; he was pasturing his flocks. we went inside and looked at everything. we saw his crates weighed down with cheese, and pens crammed full of lambs divided up by age:

The newborns, middlings, and those just weaned. there were well-crafted bowls and pails for milking, all full of whey. my crew begged,  let us grab some cheese and quickly drive the kids and lambs out of their pens and down to our swift ships, and sail away across the salty water!  that would have been the better choice. but i refused. i hoped to see him, and find out if he would give us gifts. in fact he brought no joy to my companions. then we lit

A fire, and made a sacrifice, and ate some cheese, and sat to wait inside the cave until he brought his flocks back home. he came at dinnertime, and brought a load of wood to make a fire. he hurled it noisily into the cave. we were afraid, and cowered towards the back. he drove his ewes and nannies inside to milk them, but he left the rams and he-goats in the spacious yard outside. he lifted up the heavy stone and set it

To block the entrance of the cave. it was a rock so huge and massive, twenty-two strong carts could not have dragged it from the threshold. he sat, and all in order milked his ewes and she-goats, then he set the lambs to suck beside each bleating mother. then he curdled half of the fresh white milk, set that aside in wicker baskets, and the rest he stored in pails so he could drink it with his dinner. when he had carefully performed his chores,

He lit a fire, then looked around and saw us.  strangers! who are you? where did you come from across the watery depths? are you on business, or roaming round without a goal, like pirates, who risk their lives at sea to bring disaster to other people?  so he spoke. his voice, so deep and booming, and his giant size, made our hearts sink in terror. even so, i answered,  we are greeks, come here from troy. the winds have swept us off in all directions

Across the vast expanse of sea, off course from our planned route back home. zeus willed it so. we are proud to be the men of agamemnon, the son of atreus, whose fame is greatest under the sky, for sacking that vast city and killing many people. now we beg you, here at your knees, to grant a gift, as is the norm for hosts and guests. please sir, my lord: respect the gods. we are your suppliants, and zeus is on our side, since he takes care

Of visitors, guest-friends, and those in need.  unmoved he said,  well, foreigner, you are a fool, or from some very distant country. you order me to fear the gods! my people think nothing of that zeus with his big scepter, nor any god; our strength is more than theirs. if i spare you or spare your friends, it will not be out of fear of zeus. i do the bidding of my own heart. but are you going far in that fine ship of yours, or somewhere near? 

He spoke to test me, but i saw right through him. i know how these things work. i answered him deceitfully.  poseidon, the earth-shaker, shipwrecked me at the far end of your island. he pushed us in; wind dashed us on the rocks. we barely managed to survive.  but he made no reply and showed no mercy. leaping up high, he reached his hands towards my men, seized two, and knocked them hard against the ground like puppies, and the floor was wet with brains.

He ripped them limb by limb to make his meal, then ate them like a lion on the mountains, devouring flesh, entrails, and marrow bones, and leaving nothing. watching this disaster, we wept and lifted up our hands in prayer to zeus. we felt so helpless. when the cyclops had filled his massive belly with his meal of human meat and unmixed milk, he lay stretched out among his flocks. then thinking like a military man, i thought i should

Get out my sword, go up to him and thrust right through his torso, feeling for his liver. that would have doomed us all. on second thoughts, i realized we were too weak to move the mighty stone he set in the high doorway. so we stayed there in misery till dawn. early the dawn appeared, pink fingers blooming, and then he lit his fire and milked his ewes in turn, and set a lamb by every one. when he had diligently done his chores,

He grabbed two men and made a meal of them. after he ate, he drove his fat flock out. he rolled the boulder out and back with ease, as one would set the lid upon a quiver. then whistling merrily, the cyclops drove his fat flocks to the mountain. i was left, scheming to take revenge on him and hurt him, and gain the glory, if athena let me. i made my plan. beside the pen there stood a great big club, green olive wood, which he

Had cut to dry, to be his walking stick. it was so massive that it looked to us like a ship s mast, a twenty-oared black freighter that sails across the vast sea full of cargo. i went and cut from it about a fathom, and gave it to the men, and ordered them to scrape it down. they made it smooth and i stood by and sharpened up the tip, and made it hard in the blazing flame. the cave was full of dung; i hid the club beneath a pile.

Then i gave orders that the men cast lots for who would lift the stake with me and press it into his eye, when sweet sleep overtook him. the lots fell on the men i would have chosen: four men, and i was fifth among their number. at evening he drove back his woolly flocks into the spacious cave, both male and female, and left none in the yard outside perhaps suspecting something, or perhaps a god told him to do it. he picked up and placed

The stone to form a door, and sat to milk the sheep and bleating goats in turn, then put the little ones to suck. his chores were done; he grabbed two men for dinner. i approached and offered him a cup of ivy wood, filled full of wine. i said,  here, cyclops! you have eaten human meat; now drink some wine, sample the merchandise our ship contains. i brought it as a holy offering, so you might pity me and send me home.

But you are in a cruel rage, beyond what anyone could bear. do you expect more guests, when you have treated us so rudely?  he took and drank the sweet delicious wine; he loved it, and demanded more.  another! and now tell me your name, so i can give you a present as my guest, one you will like. my people do have wine; grape clusters grow from our rich earth, fed well by rain from zeus. but this is nectar, god food!  so i gave him

Another cup of wine, and then two more. he drank them all, unwisely. with the wine gone to his head, i told him, all politeness,  cyclops, you asked my name. i will reveal it; then you must give the gift you promised me, of hospitality. my name is noman. my family and friends all call me noman.  he answered with no pity in his heart,  i will eat noman last; first i will eat the other men. that is my gift to you. 

Then he collapsed, fell on his back, and lay there, his massive neck askew. all-conquering sleep took him. in drunken heaviness, he spewed wine from his throat, and chunks of human flesh. and then i drove the spear into the embers to heat it up, and told my men,  be brave!  i wanted none of them to shrink in fear. the fire soon seized the olive spear, green though it was, and terribly it glowed. i quickly snatched it from the fire. my crew

Stood firm: some god was breathing courage in us. they took the olive spear, its tip all sharp, and shoved it in his eye. i leaned on top and twisted it, as when a man drills wood for shipbuilding. below, the workers spin the drill with straps, stretched out from either end. so round and round it goes, and so we whirled the fire-sharp weapon in his eye. his blood poured out around the stake, and blazing fire sizzled his lids and brows, and fried the roots.

As when a blacksmith dips an axe or adze to temper it in ice-cold water; loudly it shrieks. from this, the iron takes on its power. so did his eyeball crackle on the spear. horribly then he howled, the rocks resounded, and we shrank back in fear. he tugged the spear out of his eye, all soaked with gushing blood. desperately with both hands he hurled it from him, and shouted to the cyclopes who lived in caves high up on windy cliffs around.

They heard and came from every side, and stood near to the cave, and called out,  polyphemus! what is the matter? are you badly hurt? why are you screaming through the holy night and keeping us awake? is someone stealing your herds, or trying to kill you, by some trick or force?  strong polyphemus from inside replied,  my friends! noman is killing me by tricks, not force.  their words flew back to him:  if no one hurts you, you are all alone:

Great zeus has made you sick; no help for that. pray to your father, mighty lord poseidon.  then off they went, and i laughed to myself, at how my name, the  no man  maneuver, tricked him. the cyclops groaned and labored in his pain, felt with blind hands and took the door-stone out, and sat there at the entrance, arms outstretched, to catch whoever went out with the sheep. maybe he thought i was a total fool. but i was strategizing, hatching plans,

So that my men and i could all survive. i wove all kinds of wiles and cunning schemes; danger was near and it was life or death. the best idea i formed was this: there were those well-fed sturdy rams with good thick fleece, wool as dark as violets all fine big creatures. so silently i tied them with the rope used by the giant cyclops as a bed. i bound the rams in sets of three and set a man beneath each middle sheep, with one

On either side, and so my men were saved. one ram was best of all the flock; i grabbed his back and curled myself up underneath his furry belly, clinging to his fleece; by force of will i kept on hanging there. and then we waited miserably for day. when early dawn revealed her rose-red hands, the rams jumped up, all eager for the grass. the ewes were bleating in their pens, unmilked, their udders full to bursting. though their master

Was weak and worn with pain, he felt the back of each ram as he lined them up but missed the men tied up beneath their woolly bellies. last of them all, the big ram went outside, heavy with wool and me the clever trickster. strong polyphemus stroked his back and asked him,  sweet ram, why are you last today to leave the cave? you are not normally so slow. you are the first to eat the tender flowers, leaping across the meadow, first to drink,

And first to want to go back to the sheepfold at evening time. but now you are the last. you grieve for master s eye; that wicked man, helped by his nasty henchmen, got me drunk and blinded me. noman will not escape! if only you could talk like me, and tell me where he is skulking in his fear of me. then i would dash his brains out on the rocks, and make them spatter all across the cave, to ease the pain that no-good noman brought. 

With that, he nudged the ram away outside. we rode a short way from the cave, then i first freed myself and then untied my men. we stole his nice fat animals, and ran, constantly glancing all around and back until we reached the ship. the other men were glad to see us, their surviving friends, but wept for those who died. i ordered them to stop their crying, scowling hard at each. i made them shove the fleecy flock on board,

And row the boat out into salty water. so they embarked, sat on their rowing benches, and struck their oar blades in the whitening sea. when i had gone as far as shouts can carry, i jeered back,  hey, you, cyclops! idiot! the crew trapped in your cave did not belong to some poor weakling. well, you had it coming! you had no shame at eating your own guests! so zeus and other gods have paid you back.  my taunting made him angrier. he ripped

A rock out of the hill and hurled it at us. it landed right in front of our dark prow, and almost crushed the tip of the steering oar. the stone sank in the water; waves surged up. the backflow all at once propelled the ship landwards; the swollen water pushed us with it. i grabbed a big long pole, and shoved us off. i told my men,  row fast, to save your lives!  and gestured with my head to make them hurry. they bent down to their oars and started rowing.

We got out twice as far across the sea, and then i called to him again. my crew begged me to stop, and pleaded with me.  please! calm down! why are you being so insistent and taunting this wild man? he hurled that stone and drove our ship right back to land. we thought that we were going to die. if he had heard us, he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and wooden ship. he throws so hard! but my tough heart was not convinced; i was

Still furious, and shouted back again,  cyclops! if any mortal asks you how your eye was mutilated and made blind, say that odysseus, the city-sacker, laertes  son, who lives in ithaca, destroyed your sight.  he groaned,  the prophecy! it has come true at last! there was a tall and handsome man named telemus, the son of eurymus, who lived among my people; he spent his life here, soothsaying for us.

He told me that odysseus  hands would make me lose my sight. i always thought a tall and handsome man would visit me, endowed with strength and courage. but this weakling, this little nobody, has blinded me; by wine he got the best of me. come on, odysseus, and let me give you gifts, and ask poseidon s help to get you home. i am his son; the god is proud to be my father. he will heal me, if he wants,

Though no one else, not god nor man, can do it.  after he said these words, i answered him,  if only i could steal your life from you, and send you down to hades  house below, as sure as nobody will ever heal you, even the god of earthquakes.  but he prayed holding his arms towards the starry sky,  listen, earth-shaker, blue-haired lord poseidon: acknowledge me your son, and be my father. grant that odysseus, the city-sacker,

Will never go back home. or if it is fated that he will see his family, then let him get there late and with no honor, in pain and lacking ships, and having caused the death of all his men, and let him find more trouble in his own house.  blue poseidon granted his son s prayer. polyphemus raised a rock far bigger than the last, and swung, then hurled it with immeasurable force. it fell a little short, beside our rudder,

And splashed into the sea; the waves surged up, and pushed the boat ahead, to the other shore. we reached the island where our ships were docked. the men were sitting waiting for us, weeping. we beached our ship and disembarked, then took the sheep that we had stolen from the cyclops out of the ship s hold, and we shared them out fairly, so all the men got equal portions. but in dividing up the flock, my crew gave me alone the ram, the cyclops  favorite.

There on the shore, i slaughtered him for zeus, the son of cronus, god of dark clouds, lord of all the world. i burned the thighs. the god ignored my offering, and planned to ruin all of my ships and all my loyal men. so all day long till sunset we were sitting, feasting on meat and drinking sweet strong wine. but when the sun went down and darkness fell, we went to sleep beside the breaking waves. then when rose-fingered dawn came, bright and early,

I roused my men and told them to embark and loose the cables. quickly they obeyed, sat at their rowing benches, all in order, and struck the gray saltwater with their oars. so we sailed on, with sorrow in our hearts, glad to survive, but grieving for our friends.",a pirate in a shepherd s cave wily odysseus  the lord of lies  answered   my lord alcinous  great king  it is a splendid thing to hear a poet as talented as this  his voice is godlike  i think that there can be no greater pleasure than when the whole community enjoys a banquet  as we sit inside the house  and listen to the singer  and the tables are heaped with bread and meat  the wine boy ladles drink from the bowl and pours it into cups   to me this seems ideal  a thing of beauty  now something prompted you to ask about my own sad story  i will tell you  though the memory increases my despair  where shall i start  where can i end  the gods have given me so much to cry about  first i will tell my name  so we will be acquainted and if i survive  you can be my guest in my distant home one day  i am odysseus  laertes  son   known for my many clever tricks and lies  my fame extends to heaven  but i live in ithaca  where shaking forest hides mount neriton  close by are other islands  dulichium  and wooded zacynthus and same  all the others face the dawn  my ithaca is set apart  most distant  facing the dark  it is a rugged land  but good at raising children  to my eyes no country could be sweeter  as you know   divine calpyso held me in her cave  wanting to marry me  and likewise circe  the trickster  trapped me  and she wanted me to be her husband  but she never swayed my heart  since when a man is far from home  living abroad  there is no sweeter thing than his own native land and family  now let me tell you all the trouble zeus has caused me on my journey home from troy  a blast of wind pushed me off course towards  the cicones in ismarus  i sacked the town and killed the men  we took their wives and shared their riches equally among us  then i said we must run away  those fools refused to listen  they were drinking wine excessively  and killing sheep and cattle along the beach  the cicones called out to neighbors on the mainland  who were strong and numerous  and skilled at horseback fighting  and if need be  on foot  they came like leaves  and blossoms in the spring at dawn  then zeus gave us bad luck  poor us  the enemy assembled round the ships and fought with swords of bronze  and while the holy morning light was bright and strong  we held them off  though they outnumbered us  but when the sun turned round and dipped  the hour when oxen are released  the cicones began to overpower us greeks  six well armed members of my crew died from each ship  the rest of us survived   and we escaped the danger  we prepared to sail away with heavy hearts  relieved to be alive  but grieving for our friends  before we launched the ships  we called aloud three times to each of our poor lost companions  slaughtered at the hands of the cicones  the cloud lord zeus hurled north wind at our ships  a terrible typhoon  and covered up the sea and earth with fog  night fell from heaven and seized us and our ships keeled over sideways   the sails were ripped three times by blasting wind  scared for our lives  we hoisted down the sails and rowed with all our might towards the shore  we stayed there for two days and nights  exhausted  eating our hearts with pain  when bright haired dawn brought the third morning  we set up our masts  unfurled the shining sails  and climbed aboard  the wind blew straight  the pilots steered  and i would have come safely home  to my own land  but as i rounded malea  a current  and blast of wind pushed me off course  away from cythera  for nine days i was swept by stormy winds across the fish filled sea  on the tenth day  i landed on the island of those who live on food from lotus flowers  we gathered water  and my crew prepared a meal  we picnicked by the ships  then i chose two men  and one slave to make the third  to go and scout  we needed to find out what kind of people lived there on that island   the scouts encountered humans  lotus eaters  who did not hurt them  they just shared with them their sweet delicious fruit  but as they ate it  they lost the will to come back and bring news to me  they wanted only to stay there  feeding on lotus with the lotus eaters  they had forgotten home  i dragged them back in tears  forced them on board the hollow ships  pushed them below the decks  and tied them up  i told the other men  the loyal ones   to get back in the ships  so no one else would taste the lotus and forget about our destination  they embarked and sat along the rowing benches  side by side  and struck the grayish water with their oars  with heavy hearts we sailed along and reached the country of high minded cyclopes  the mavericks  they put their trust in gods  and do not plant their food from seed  nor plow  and yet the barley  grain  and clustering wine grapes  all flourish there  increased by rain from zeus  they hold no councils  have no common laws  but live in caves on lofty mountaintops  and each makes laws for his own wife and children  without concern for what the others think  a distance from this island is another  across the water  slantways from the harbor  level and thickly wooded  countless goats live there but people never visit it  no hunters labor through its woods to scale  its hilly peaks  there are no flocks of sheep  no fields of plowland it is all untilled  unsown and uninhabited by humans  only the bleating goats live there and graze  cyclopic people have no red cheeked ships and no shipwright among them who could build boats  to enable them to row across to other cities  as most people do  crossing the sea to visit one another  with boats they could have turned this island into  a fertile colony  with proper harvests  by the gray shore there lie well watered meadows  where vines would never fail  there is flat land for plowing  and abundant crops would grow in the autumn  there is richness underground  the harbor has good anchorage  there is no need of anchor stones or ropes or cables  the ships that come to shore there can remain beached safely till the sailors wish to leave and fair winds blow  up by the harbor head  freshwater gushes down beneath the caves  the poplars grow around it  there we sailed  the gods were guiding us all through the darkness  thick fog wrapped round our ships and in the sky the moon was dark and clothed in clouds  so we saw nothing of the island  none of us could see the great waves rolling in towards the land  until we rowed right to the beach  we lowered all the sails and disembarked onto the shore  and there we fell asleep   when early dawn shone forth with rosy fingers  we roamed around that island full of wonders  the daughters of the great king zeus  the nymphs  drove out the mountain goats so that my crew could eat  on seeing them  we dashed to fetch our javelins and bows from on board ship  we split into three groups  took aim and shot  some god gave us good hunting  all twelve crews had nine goats each  and ten for mine  we sat there all day till sunset  eating meat and drinking  our strong red wine  the ships  supply of that had not run out  when we had sacked the holy citadel of the cicones  we all took gallons of it  poured in great big pitchers  we looked across the narrow strip of water at the cyclopic island  saw their smoke  and heard the baaing of their sheep and goats  the sun went down and in the hours of darkness we lay and slept on shore beside the sea  but when the rosy hands of dawn appeared   i called my men together and addressed them   my loyal friends  stay here  the rest of you  while with my boat and crew i go to check who those men are  find out if they are wild  lawless aggressors  or the type to welcome strangers  and fear the gods   with that  i climbed on board and told my crew to come with me and then untie the cables of the ship  quickly they did so  sat along the benches  and struck the whitening water with their oars   the journey was not long  upon arrival  right at the edge of land  beside the sea  we saw a high cave overhung with laurel  the home of several herds of sheep and goats  around that cave was built a lofty courtyard  of deep set stones  with tall pines rising up  and leafy oaks  there lived a massive man who shepherded his flocks all by himself  he did not go to visit other people  but kept apart  and did not know the ways  of custom  in his build he was a wonder  a giant  not like men who live on bread  but like a wooded peak in airy mountains  rising alone above the rest  i told my loyal crew to guard the ship  while i would go with just twelve chosen men  my favorites  i took a goatskin full of dark sweet wine that i was given by apollo s priest  maron the son of euanthes  who lived inside the shady grove on ismarus   in reverence to the god  i came to help him  and save his wife and son  he gave me gifts  a silver bowl and seven pounds of gold  well wrought  and siphoned off some sweet strong wine  and filled twelve jars for me a godlike drink  the slaves knew nothing of this wine  it was known just to him  his wife  and one house girl  whenever he was drinking it  he poured a single shot into a cup  and added twenty of water  and a marvelous smell  rose from the bowl  and all would long to taste it  i filled a big skin up with it  and packed provisions in a bag my heart suspected that i might meet a man of courage  wild  and lacking knowledge of the normal customs  we soon were at the cave  but did not find the cyclops  he was pasturing his flocks  we went inside and looked at everything  we saw his crates weighed down with cheese  and pens crammed full of lambs divided up by age   the newborns  middlings  and those just weaned  there were well crafted bowls and pails for milking  all full of whey  my crew begged   let us grab some cheese and quickly drive the kids and lambs out of their pens and down to our swift ships  and sail away across the salty water   that would have been the better choice  but i refused  i hoped to see him  and find out if he would give us gifts  in fact he brought no joy to my companions  then we lit  a fire  and made a sacrifice  and ate some cheese  and sat to wait inside the cave until he brought his flocks back home  he came at dinnertime  and brought a load of wood to make a fire  he hurled it noisily into the cave  we were afraid  and cowered towards the back  he drove his ewes and nannies inside to milk them  but he left the rams and he goats in the spacious yard outside  he lifted up the heavy stone and set it  to block the entrance of the cave  it was a rock so huge and massive  twenty two strong carts could not have dragged it from the threshold  he sat  and all in order milked his ewes and she goats  then he set the lambs to suck beside each bleating mother  then he curdled half of the fresh white milk  set that aside in wicker baskets  and the rest he stored in pails so he could drink it with his dinner  when he had carefully performed his chores   he lit a fire  then looked around and saw us   strangers  who are you  where did you come from across the watery depths  are you on business  or roaming round without a goal  like pirates  who risk their lives at sea to bring disaster to other people   so he spoke  his voice  so deep and booming  and his giant size  made our hearts sink in terror  even so  i answered   we are greeks  come here from troy  the winds have swept us off in all directions  across the vast expanse of sea  off course from our planned route back home  zeus willed it so  we are proud to be the men of agamemnon  the son of atreus  whose fame is greatest under the sky  for sacking that vast city and killing many people  now we beg you  here at your knees  to grant a gift  as is the norm for hosts and guests  please sir  my lord  respect the gods  we are your suppliants  and zeus is on our side  since he

shipwrecked me at the far end of your island  he pushed us in  wind dashed us on the rocks  we barely managed to survive   but he made no reply and showed no mercy  leaping up high  he reached his

all alone   great zeus has made you sick  no help for that  pray to your father  mighty lord poseidon   then off they went  and i laughed to myself  at how my name  the  no man  maneuver  tricked him

not escape  if only you could talk like me  and tell me where he is skulking in his fear of me  then i would dash his brains out on the rocks  and make them spatter all across the cave  to ease the pain that no good noman brought    with that  he nudged the ram away outside  we rode a short way from the cave  then i first freed myself and then untied my men  we stole his nice fat animals  and ran  constantly glancing all around and back until we reached the ship  the other men were glad to see us  their surviving friends  but wept for those who died  i ordered them to stop their crying  scowling hard at each  i made them shove the fleecy flock on board   and row the boat out into salty water  so they embarked  sat on their rowing benches  and struck their oar blades in the whitening sea  when i had gone as far as shouts can carry  i jeered back   hey  you  cyclops  idiot  the crew trapped in your cave did not belong to some poor weakling  well  you had it coming  you had no shame at eating your own guests  so zeus and other gods have paid you back   my taunting made him angrier  he ripped  a rock out of the hill and hurled it at us  it landed right in front of our dark prow  and almost crushed the tip of the steering oar  the stone sank in the water  waves surged up  the backflow all at once propelled the ship landwards  the swollen water pushed us with it  i grabbed a big long pole  and shoved us off  i told my men   row fast  to save your lives   and gestured with my head to make them hurry  they bent down to their oars and started rowing   we got out twice as far across the sea  and then i called to him again  my crew begged me to stop  and pleaded with me   please  calm down  why are you being so insistent and taunting this wild man  he hurled that stone and drove our ship right back to land  we thought that we were going to die  if he had heard us  he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and wooden ship  he throws so hard  but my tough heart was not convinced  i was  still furious  and shouted back again   cyclops  if any mortal asks you how your eye was mutilated and made blind  say that odysseus  the city sacker  laertes  son  who lives in ithaca  destroyed your sight   he groaned   the prophecy  it has come true at last  there was a tall and handsome man named telemus  the son of eurymus  who lived among my people  he spent his life here  soothsaying for us   he told me that odysseus  hands would make me lose my sight  i always thought a tall and handsome man would visit me  endowed with strength and courage  but this weakling  this little nobody  has blinded me  by wine he got the best of me  come on  odysseus  and let me give you gifts  and ask poseidon s help to get you home  i am his son  the god is proud to be my father  he will heal me  if he wants   though no one else  not god nor man  can do it   after he said these words  i answered him   if only i could steal your life from you  and send you down to hades  house below  as sure as nobody will ever heal you  even the god of earthquakes   but he prayed holding his arms towards the starry sky   listen  earth shaker  blue haired lord poseidon  acknowledge me your son  and be my father  grant that odysseus  the city sacker   will never go back home  or if it is fated that he will see his family  then let him get there late and with no honor  in pain and lacking ships  and having caused the death of all his men  and let him find more trouble in his own house   blue poseidon granted his son s prayer  polyphemus raised a rock far bigger than the last  and swung  then hurled it with immeasurable force  it fell a little short  beside our rudder   and splashed into the sea  the waves surged up  and pushed the boat ahead  to the other shore  we reached the island where our ships were docked  the men were sitting waiting for us  weeping  we beached our ship and disembarked  then took the sheep that we had stolen from the cyclops out of the ship s hold  and we shared them out fairly  so all the men got equal portions  but in dividing up the flock  my crew gave me alone the ram  the cyclops  favorite   there on the shore  i slaughtered him for zeus  the son of cronus  god of dark clouds  lord of all the world  i burned the thighs  the god ignored my offering  and planned to ruin all of my ships and all my loyal men  so all day long till sunset we were sitting  feasting on meat and drinking sweet strong wine  but when the sun went down and darkness fell  we went to sleep beside the breaking waves  then when rose fingered dawn came  bright and early   i roused my men and told them to embark and loose the cables  quickly they obeyed  sat at their rowing benches  all in order  and struck the gray saltwater with their oars  so we sailed on  with sorrow in our hearts  glad to survive  but grieving for our

The winds and the witch  we reached the floating island of aeolus, who is well loved by all the deathless gods. around it, on sheer cliffs, there runs a wall of solid bronze, impregnable. twelve children live with him in his palace: six strong boys, and six girls. he arranged their marriages, one sister to each brother. they are always feasting there with their parents, at a banquet that never ends. by day, the savor fills the house; the court reverberates with sound.

At night they sleep beside the wives they love on rope beds piled with blankets. we arrived at that fine citadel. he welcomed me and made me stay a month, and asked for news of troy, the argive ships, and how the greeks went home. i told him everything. at last i told him he should send me on my way. so he agreed to help me, and he gave me a bag of oxhide leather and he tied the gusty winds inside it. zeus, the son

Of cronus, made him steward of the winds, and he can stop or rouse them as he wishes. he bound the bag with shining silver wire to my curved ship, so no gust could escape, however small, and he made zephyr blow so that the breath could carry home our ships and us. but it was not to be. our folly ruined us. for nine days and nights we sailed, and on the tenth, our native land appeared. we were so near, we saw men tending fires.

Exhausted, i let sweet sleep overcome me. i had been doing all the steering, hoping that we would get home sooner if i did. but while i slept my men began to mutter, saying the great aeolus gave me gifts  silver and gold that i was taking home. with glances to his neighbor, each complained,  it seems that everybody loves this man, and honors him, in every place we sail to. he also has that loot from sacking troy.

We shared the journey with him, yet we come back home with empty hands. and now aeolus has made this friendly gift to him. so hurry, we should look in the bag, and see how much is in there how much silver, how much gold.  that bad idea took hold of them; they did it. they opened up the bag, and all the winds rushed out at once. a sudden buffet seized us and hurled us back to sea, the wrong direction, far from our home. they screamed and i woke up,

And wondered if i should jump off the ship and drown, or bite my lip, be stoical, and stay among the living. i endured it, covered my face, and lay on deck. a blast of storm wind whooshed the ships back to the island of great aeolus. they began to weep. we disembarked and filled our jars with water, and hungrily the men devoured their dinner. when they were done, i took one slave with me and one crew member, back to see aeolus.

He was at dinner with his wife and children. we entered and sat down beside the doorposts. startled, they asked,  why are you here again? you had bad luck? what happened? surely we helped you go on your way, and meant for you to reach your homeland, where you wished to go.  i answered sadly,  blame my men, and blame my stubborn urge to sleep, which ruined us. dear friends, you have the power to put things right.  i hoped these words would soften them, but they

Were silent. then the father yelled,  get out! you nasty creature, leave my island! now! it is not right for me to help convey a man so deeply hated by the gods. you godforsaken thing, how dare you come here? get out!  he roared and drove us from his palace. dispirited, we sailed away. the men grew worn out with the agony of rowing; our folly had deprived us of fair winds. we rowed six days and nights; the seventh day

We came to laestrygonia the town of telepylus upon the cliffs of lamos. a herdsman there, returning to his home, can greet another herdsman going out. a sleepless man could earn a double wage by herding cows, then pasturing white sheep  the paths of day and night are close together. we reached the famous harbor, all surrounded by sheer rock cliffs. on each side, strips of shore jut out and almost meet, a narrow mouth.

No waves rear up in there, not even small ones. white calm is everywhere. so all the others harbored their ships inside, crammed close together. i was the only one who chose to moor my ship outside the harbor, fastening the cables to a rock a way away. i disembarked and climbed a crag to scout. i saw no sign of cattle or of humans, except some smoke that rose up from the earth. i picked two men, and one slave as the third,

And sent them to find out what people lived and ate bread in this land. they disembarked and walked along a smooth path, where the wagons brought wood down from the mountains to the city. they met a girl in front of town, out fetching some water. she was heading for the fountain of artaky, the whole town s water source. she was the strapping child of antiphates, king of the laestrygonians. they asked her about the king and people of the country.

She promptly took them to the high-roofed palace of her own father. when they went inside they found a woman, mountain-high. they were appalled and shocked. the giantess at once summoned the king her husband from the council; he tried to kill my men, and grabbing one he ate him up. the other two escaped, back to the ship. the king s shout boomed through town. hearing, the mighty laestrygonians thronged from all sides, not humanlike, but giants.

With boulders bigger than a man could lift they pelted at us from the cliffs. we heard the dreadful uproar of ships being broken and dying men. they speared them there like fish. a gruesome meal! while they were killing them inside the harbor, i drew out my sword and cut the ropes that moored my dark-cheeked ship, and yelling to my men, i told them,  row as fast as possible away from danger!  they rowed at double time, afraid to die.

My ship was lucky and we reached the sea beyond the overhanging cliffs. the rest, trapped in the bay together, were destroyed. we sailed off sadly, happy to survive, but with our good friends lost. we reached aeaea, home of the beautiful, dreadful goddess circe, who speaks in human languages the sister of aeetes whose mind is set on ruin. those two are children of the sun who shines on mortals, and of perse, child of ocean.

Under the guidance of some god we drifted silently to the harbor, and we moored there. for two days and two nights we lay onshore, exhausted and our hearts consumed with grief. on the third morning brought by braided dawn, i took my spear and sharp sword, and i ran up from the ship to higher ground, to look for signs of humans, listening for voices. i climbed up to a crag, and i saw smoke rising from circe s palace, from the earth

Up through the woods and thickets. i considered if i should go down and investigate, since i had seen the smoke. but i decided to go back down first, to the beach and ship and feed my men, and then set out to scout. when i had almost reached my ship, some god took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a mighty stag with great tall antlers to cross my path. he ran down from the forest to drink out of the river; it was hot.

I struck him in the middle of his back; my bronze spear pierced him. with a moan, he fell onto the dust; his spirit flew away. i stepped on him and tugged my bronze spear out, and left it on the ground, while i plucked twigs and twines, and wove a rope, a fathom s length, well knotted all the way along, and bound the hooves of that huge animal. i went down to my dark ship with him on my back. i used my spear to lean on, since the stag

Was too big to be lugged across one shoulder. i dumped him down before the ship and made a comforting pep talk to cheer my men.  my friends! we will not yet go down to hades, sad though we are, before our fated day. come on, since we have food and drink on board, let us not starve ourselves; now time to eat!  they quickly heeded my commands, and took their cloaks down from their faces, and they marveled to see the big stag lying on the beach.

It was enormous. when they finished staring, they washed their hands and cooked a splendid meal. so all that day till sunset we sat eating the meat aplenty and the strong sweet wine. when darkness fell, we went to sleep beside the seashore. then the roses of dawn s fingers appeared again; i called my men and told them,  listen to me, my friends, despite your grief. we do not know where darkness lives, nor dawn, nor where the sun that shines upon the world

Goes underneath the earth, nor where it rises. we need a way to fix our current plight, but i do not know how. i climbed the rocks to higher ground to look around. this is an island, wreathed about by boundless sea. the land lies low. i saw smoke in the middle, rising up through the forest and thick bush.  at that, their hearts sank, since they all remembered what happened with the laestrygonians, their king antiphates, and how the mighty

Cyclops devoured the men. they wept and wailed, and shed great floods of tears. but all that grieving could do no good. i made them wear their armor, and split them in two groups. i led one, and made godlike eurylochus lead the other. we shook the lots in a helmet made of bronze; eurylochus  lot jumped out. so he went with his band of twenty-two, all weeping. those left behind with me were crying too. inside the glade they found the house of circe

Built out of polished stones, on high foundations. round it were mountain wolves and lions, which she tamed with drugs. they did not rush on them, but gathered around them in a friendly way, their long tails wagging, as dogs nuzzle round their master when he comes back home from dinner with treats for them. just so, those sharp-clawed wolves and lions, mighty beasts, came snuggling up. the men were terrified. they stood outside and heard some lovely singing. it was circe,

The goddess. she was weaving as she sang, an intricate, enchanting piece of work, the kind a goddess fashions. then polites, my most devoted and most loyal man, a leader to his peers, said,  friends, inside someone is weaving on that massive loom, and singing so the floor resounds. perhaps a woman, or a goddess. let us call her.  they shouted out to her. she came at once, opened the shining doors, and asked them in.

So thinking nothing of it, in they went. eurylochus alone remained outside, suspecting trickery. she led them in, sat them on chairs, and blended them a potion of barley, cheese, and golden honey, mixed with pramnian wine. she added potent drugs to make them totally forget their home. they took and drank the mixture. then she struck them, using her magic wand, and penned them in the pigsty. they were turned to pigs in body

And voice and hair; their minds remained the same. they squealed at their imprisonment, and circe threw them some mast and cornel cherries food that pigs like rooting for in muddy ground. eurylochus ran back to our black ship, to tell us of the terrible disaster that happened to his friends. he tried to speak, but could not, overwhelmed by grief. his eyes were full of tears, his heart was pierced with sorrow. astonished, we all questioned him. at last

He spoke about what happened to the others.  odysseus, we went off through the woods, as you commanded. in the glade we found a beautiful tall house of polished stone. we heard a voice: a woman or a goddess was singing as she worked her loom. my friends called out to her. she opened up the doors, inviting them inside. suspecting nothing, they followed her. but i stayed there outside, fearing some trick. then all at once, they vanished.

I sat there for a while to watch and wait, but none of them came back.  at this, i strapped my silver-studded sword across my back, took up my bow, and told him,  take me there.  he grasped my knees and begged me tearfully,  no no, my lord! please do not make me go! let me stay here! you cannot bring them back, and you will not return here if you try. hurry, we must escape with these men here! we have a chance to save our lives!  i said,

 you can stay here beside the ship and eat and drink. but i will go. i must do this.  i left the ship and shore, and walked on up, crossing the sacred glades, and i had almost reached the great house of the enchantress circe, when i met hermes, carrying his wand of gold. he seemed an adolescent boy, the cutest age, when beards first start to grow. he took my hand and said,  why have you come across these hills alone? you do not know

This place, poor man. your men were turned to pigs in circe s house, and crammed in pens. do you imagine you can set them free? you cannot. if you try that, you will not get back home. you will stay here with them. but i can help you. here, take this antidote to keep you safe when you go into circe s house. now i will tell you all her lethal spells and tricks. she will make you a potion mixed with poison. its magic will not work on you because

You have the herb i gave you. when she strikes you with her long wand, then draw your sharpened sword and rush at her as if you mean to kill her. she will be frightened of you, and will tell you to sleep with her. do not hold out against her  she is a goddess. if you sleep with her, you will set free your friends and save yourself. tell her to swear an oath by all the gods that she will not plot further harm for you  or while you have your clothes off, she may hurt you,

Unmanning you.  the bright mercurial god pulled from the ground a plant and showed me how its root is black, its flower white as milk. the gods call this plant moly. it is hard for mortal men to dig it up, but gods are able to do everything. then hermes flew through the wooded island, back towards high mount olympus. i went in the house of circe. my heart pounded as i walked. i stood there at the doorway, and i saw her,

The lovely circe with her braided hair. i called; she heard and opened up the doors and asked me in. i followed nervously. she led me to a silver-studded chair, all finely crafted, with a footstool under. in a gold cup she mixed a drink for me, adding the drug she hoped to do me harm. i sipped it, but the magic did not work. she struck me with her wand and said,  now go! out to the sty, and lie there with your men! 

But i drew my sharp sword from by my thigh and leapt at her as if i meant to kill her. she screamed and ducked beneath the sword, and grasped my knees, and wailing asked me,  who are you? where is your city? and who are your parents? i am amazed that you could drink my potion and yet not be bewitched. no other man has drunk it and withstood the magic charm. but you are different. your mind is not enchanted. you must be odysseus,

The man who can adapt to anything. bright flashing hermes of the golden wand has often told me that you would sail here from troy in your swift ship. now sheathe your sword and come to bed with me. through making love we may begin to trust each other more.  i answered,  circe! how can you command me to treat you gently, when you turned my men to pigs, and you are planning to play tricks in telling me to come to bed with you,

So you can take my courage and my manhood when you have got me naked? i refuse to come to bed with you, unless you swear a mighty oath that you will not form plans to hurt me anymore.  when i said that, at once she made the oath as i had asked. she vowed and formed the oath, and then at last i went up to the dazzling bed of circe. meanwhile, four slaves, her house girls, were at work around the palace. they were nymphs, the daughters

Of fountains and of groves and holy rivers that flow into the sea. one set fine cloths of purple on the chairs, with stones beneath them. beside each chair, another pulled up tables of silver and set golden baskets on them. the third mixed up inside a silver bowl sweet, cheering wine, and poured it in gold cups. the fourth brought water, and she lit a fire beneath a mighty tripod, till it boiled. it started bubbling in the copper cauldron;

She took me to the bathtub, and began to wash my head and shoulders, using water mixed to the perfect temperature, to take my deep soul-crushing weariness away. after the bath, she oiled my skin and dressed me in fine wool cloak and tunic, and she led me to a silver-studded well-carved chair, and set a footstool underneath. another slave brought water for my hands, in a gold pitcher, and poured it over them, to a silver bowl.

She set a polished table near. the cook brought bread and laid a generous feast, and circe told me to eat. but my heart was unwilling. i sat there with my mind on other things; i had forebodings. circe noticed me sitting, not touching food, and weighed by grief. she stood near me and asked,  odysseus! why are you sitting there so silently, like someone mute, eating your heart, not touching the banquet or the wine? you need not fear.

Remember, i already swore an oath.  but i said,  circe, no! what decent man could bear to taste his food or sip his wine before he saw his men with his own eyes, and set them free? if you are so insistent on telling me to eat and drink, then free them, so i may see with my own eyes my crew of loyal men.  so circe left the hall holding her wand, and opened up the pigsty and drove them out, still looking like fat boars,

Large and full grown. they stood in front of her. majestic lady circe walked among them, anointing each with some new drug. the potion had made thick hog-hairs sprout out on their bodies. those bristles all flew off and they were men, but younger than before, and much more handsome, and taller. then they recognized me. each embraced me tightly in his arms, and started sobbing in desperation. so the house rang loud with noise, and even she herself

Pitied them. she came near to me and said,  odysseus, you always find solutions. go now to your swift ship beside the sea. first drag the ship to land, and bring your stores and all your gear inside the caves. then come back with your loyal men.  my heart agreed; i went down to my swift ship on the shore. i found my loyal men beside the ship, weeping and shedding floods of tears. as when a herd of cows is coming back from pasture

Into the yard; and all the little heifers jump from their pens to skip and run towards their mothers, and they cluster round them, mooing; just so my men, as soon as they saw me, began to weep, and in their minds it seemed as if they had arrived in their own home, the land of rugged ithaca, where they were born and raised. still sobbing, they cried out,  oh, master! we are glad to see you back! it is as if we had come home ourselves,

To ithaca, our fatherland. but tell us about how all our other friends were killed.  i reassured them, saying,  first we must drag up the ship to land, and put the stores and all our gear inside the caves; then hurry, all of you, come with me, and see your friends inside the goddess circe s holy house, eating and drinking; they have food enough to last forever.  they believed my story, with the exception of eurylochus,

Who warned them,  fools! why would you go up there? why would you choose to take on so much danger, to enter circe s house, where she will turn us to pigs or wolves or lions, all of us, forced to protect her mighty house for her? remember what the cyclops did? our friends went to his home with this rash lord of ours. because of his bad choices, they all died.  at that, i thought of drawing my long sword from by my sturdy thigh, to cut his head off

And let it fall down to the ground although he was close family. my men restrained me, saying to me,  no, king, please let him go! let him stay here and guard the ship, and we will follow you to circe s holy house.  so they went up, away from ship and shore. eurylochus did not stay there; he came, fearing my angry scolding. meanwhile circe had freed the other men, and in her house she gently bathed them, rubbing them with oil.

She had them dressed in woolen cloaks and tunics. we found them feasting in the hall. the men, seeing each other face-to-face again, began to weep; their sobbing filled the hall. the goddess stood beside me and said,  king, clever odysseus, laertes  son, now stop encouraging this lamentation. i know you and your men have suffered greatly, out on the fish-filled sea, and on dry land from hostile men. but it is time to eat

And drink some wine. you must get back the drive you had when you set out from ithaca. you are worn down and brokenhearted, always dwelling on pain and wandering. you never feel joy at heart. you have endured too much.  we did as she had said. then every day for a whole year we feasted there on meat and sweet strong wine. but when the year was over, when months had waned and seasons turned, and each long day had passed its course, my loyal men

Called me and said,  be guided by the gods. now it is time to think of our own country, if you are fated to survive and reach your high-roofed house and your forefathers  land.  my warrior soul agreed. so all day long till sunset we kept sitting at the feast of meat and sweet strong wine. but when the sun set, and the darkness came, they went to bed all through the shadowy palace. i went up to circe s splendid bed, and touched her knees

In supplication, and the goddess listened.  circe,  i said,  fulfill the vow you made to send me home. my heart now longs to go. my men are also desperate to leave. whenever you are absent, they exhaust me with constant lamentation.  and she answered,  laertes  son, great king odysseus, master of every challenge, you need not remain here in my house against your will. but first you must complete another journey.

Go to the house of hades and the dreadful persephone, and ask the theban prophet, the blind tiresias, for his advice. persephone has given him alone full understanding, even now in death. the other spirits flit around as shadows.  that broke my heart, and sitting on the bed i wept, and lost all will to live and see the shining sun. when i was done with sobbing and rolling round in grief, i said to her,

 but circe, who can guide us on this journey? no one before has ever sailed to hades by ship.  and right away the goddess answered,  you are resourceful, king odysseus. you need not worry that you have no pilot to steer your ship. set up your mast, let fly your white sails, and sit down. the north wind s breath will blow the ship. when you have crossed the stream of ocean, you will reach the shore, where willows let fall their dying fruit, and towering poplars

Grow in the forest of persephone. tie up your ship in the deep-eddying ocean, and go into the spacious home of hades. the pyriphlegethon and cocytus, a tributary of the styx, both run into the acheron. the flowing water resounds beside the rock. brave man, go there, and dig a hole a cubit wide and long, and round it pour libations for the dead: first honey-mix, then sweet wine, and the third

Of water. sprinkle barley, and beseech the spirits of the dead. vow if you reach the barren land of ithaca, to kill a heifer in your halls, the best you have, uncalved, and you will heap the fire with meat, and offer to tiresias alone a ram, pure black, the best of all your flock. when you have prayed to all the famous dead, slaughter one ram and one black ewe, directing the animals to erebus, but turn

Yourself away, towards the gushing river. many will come. then tell your men to skin the sheep that lie there killed by ruthless bronze, and burn them, with a prayer to mighty hades and terrible persephone. then draw your sword and sit. do not let them come near the blood, until you hear tiresias. the prophet will soon come, and he will tell you about your journey, measured out across the fish-filled sea, and how you will get home. 

Dawn on her golden throne began to shine, and circe dressed me in my cloak and tunic. the goddess wore a long white dress, of fine and delicate fabric, with a golden belt, and on her head, a veil. then i walked round, all through the house, and called my men. i stood beside each one, and roused them with my words.  wake up! now no more dozing in sweet sleep. we have to go. the goddess gave instructions.  they did as i had said. but even then

I could not lead my men away unharmed. the youngest one elpenor was his name  not very brave in war, nor very smart, was lying high up in the home of circe, apart from his companions, seeking coolness since he was drunk. he heard the noise and bustle, the movements of his friends, and jumped up quickly, forgetting to climb down the lofty ladder. he fell down crashing headlong from the roof, and broke his neck, right at the spine. his spirit

Went down to hades. then i told the others,  perhaps you think that you are going home. but circe says we have to go towards the house of hades and persephone, to meet tiresias, the theban spirit.  at that, their hearts were broken. they sat down right there and wept and tore their clothes. but all their lamentation did no good. we went down to our speedy ship beside the sea, despite our grief. we shed abundant tears.

Then circe came and tied up one black ewe and one ram by the ship, and slipped away, easily; who can see the gods go by unless they wish to show themselves to us?",the winds and the witch  we reached the floating island of aeolus  who is well loved by all the deathless gods  around it  on sheer cliffs  there runs a wall of solid bronze  impregnable  twelve children live with him in his palace  six strong boys  and six girls  he arranged their marriages  one sister to each brother  they are always feasting there with their parents  at a banquet that never ends  by day  the savor fills the house  the court reverberates with sound   at night they sleep beside the wives they love on rope beds piled with blankets  we arrived at that fine citadel  he welcomed me and made me stay a month  and asked for news of troy  the argive ships  and how the greeks went home  i told him everything  at last i told him he should send me on my way  so he agreed to help me  and he gave me a bag of oxhide leather and he tied the gusty winds inside it  zeus  the son  of cronus  made him steward of the winds  and he can stop or rouse them as he wishes  he bound the bag with shining silver wire to my curved ship  so no gust could escape  however small  and he made zephyr blow so that the breath could carry home our ships and us  but it was not to be  our folly ruined us  for nine days and nights we sailed  and on the tenth  our native land appeared  we were so near  we saw men tending fires   exhausted  i let sweet sleep overcome me  i had been doing all the steering  hoping that we would get home sooner if i did  but while i slept my men began to mutter  saying the great aeolus gave me gifts  silver and gold that i was taking home  with glances to his neighbor  each complained   it seems that everybody loves this man  and honors him  in every place we sail to  he also has that loot from sacking troy   we shared the journey with him  yet we come back home with empty hands  and now aeolus has made this friendly gift to him  so hurry  we should look in the bag  and see how much is in there how much silver  how much gold   that bad idea took hold of them  they did it  they opened up the bag  and all the winds rushed out at once  a sudden buffet seized us and hurled us back to sea  the wrong direction  far from our home  they screamed and i woke up   and wondered if i should jump off the ship and drown  or bite my lip  be stoical  and stay among the living  i endured it  covered my face  and lay on deck  a blast of storm wind whooshed the ships back to the island of great aeolus  they began to weep  we disembarked and filled our jars with water  and hungrily the men devoured their dinner  when they were done  i took one slave with me and one crew member  back to see aeolus   he was at dinner with his wife and children  we entered and sat down beside the doorposts  startled  they asked   why are you here again  you had bad luck  what happened  surely we helped you go on your way  and meant for you to reach your homeland  where you wished to go   i answered sadly   blame my men  and blame my stubborn urge to sleep  which ruined us  dear friends  you have the power to put things right   i hoped these words would soften them  but they  were silent  then the father yelled   get out  you nasty creature  leave my island  now  it is not right for me to help convey a man so deeply hated by the gods  you godforsaken thing  how dare you come here  get out   he roared and drove us from his palace  dispirited  we sailed away  the men grew worn out with the agony of rowing  our folly had deprived us of fair winds  we rowed six days and nights  the seventh day  we came to laestrygonia the town of telepylus upon the cliffs of lamos  a herdsman there  returning to his home  can greet another herdsman going out  a sleepless man could earn a double wage by herding cows  then pasturing white sheep  the paths of day and night are close together  we reached the famous harbor  all surrounded by sheer rock cliffs  on each side  strips of shore jut out and almost meet  a narrow mouth   no waves rear up in there  not even small ones  white calm is everywhere  so all the others harbored their ships inside  crammed close together  i was the only one who chose to moor my ship outside the harbor  fastening the cables to a rock a way away  i disembarked and climbed a crag to scout  i saw no sign of cattle or of humans  except some smoke that rose up from the earth  i picked two men  and one slave as the third   and sent them to find out what people lived and ate bread in this land  they disembarked and walked along a smooth path  where the wagons brought wood down from the mountains to the city  they met a girl in front of town  out fetching some water  she was heading for the fountain of artaky  the whole town s water source  she was the strapping child of antiphates  king of the laestrygonians  they asked her about the king and people of the country   she promptly took them to the high roofed palace of her own father  when they went inside they found a woman  mountain high  they were appalled and shocked  the giantess at once summoned the king her husband from the council  he tried to kill my men  and grabbing one he ate him up  the other two escaped  back to the ship  the king s shout boomed through town  hearing  the mighty laestrygonians thronged from all sides  not humanlike  but giants   with boulders bigger than a man could lift they pelted at us from the cliffs  we heard the dreadful uproar of ships being broken and dying men  they speared them there like fish  a gruesome meal  while they were killing them inside the harbor  i drew out my sword and cut the ropes that moored my dark cheeked ship  and yelling to my men  i told them   row as fast as possible away from danger   they rowed at double time  afraid to die   my ship was lucky and we reached the sea beyond the overhanging cliffs  the rest  trapped in the bay together  were destroyed  we sailed off sadly  happy to survive  but with our good friends lost  we reached aeaea  home of the beautiful  dreadful goddess circe  who speaks in human languages the sister of aeetes whose mind is set on ruin  those two are children of the sun who shines on mortals  and of perse  child of ocean   under the guidance of some god we drifted silently to the harbor  and we moored there  for two days and two nights we lay onshore  exhausted and our hearts consumed with grief  on the third morning brought by braided dawn  i took my spear and sharp sword  and i ran up from the ship to higher ground  to look for signs of humans  listening for voices  i climbed up to a crag  and i saw smoke rising from circe s palace  from the earth  up through the woods and thickets  i considered if i should go down and investigate  since i had seen the smoke  but i decided to go back down first  to the beach and ship and feed my men  and then set out to scout  when i had almost reached my ship  some god took pity on me in my loneliness  and sent a mighty stag with great tall antlers to cross my path  he ran down from the forest to drink out of the river  it was hot   i struck him in the middle of his back  my bronze spear pierced him  with a moan  he fell onto the dust  his spirit flew away  i stepped on him and tugged my bronze spear out  and left it on the ground  while i plucked twigs and twines  and wove a rope  a fathom s length  well knotted all the way along  and bound the hooves of that huge animal  i went down to my dark ship with him on my back  i used my spear to lean on  since the stag  was too big to be lugged across one shoulder  i dumped him down before the ship and made a comforting pep talk to cheer my men   my friends  we will not yet go down to hades  sad though we are  before our fated day  come on  since we have food and drink on board  let us not starve ourselves  now time to eat   they quickly heeded my commands  and took their cloaks down from their faces  and they marveled to see the big stag lying on the beach   it was enormous  when they finished staring  they washed their hands and cooked a splendid meal  so all that day till sunset we sat eating the meat aplenty and the strong sweet wine  when darkness fell  we went to sleep beside the seashore  then the roses of dawn s fingers appeared again  i called my men and told them   listen to me  my friends  despite your grief  we do not know where darkness lives  nor dawn  nor where the sun that shines upon the world  goes underneath the earth  nor where it rises  we need a way to fix our current plight  but i do not know how  i climbed the rocks to higher ground to look around  this is an island  wreathed about by boundless sea  the land lies low  i saw smoke in the middle  rising up through the forest and thick bush   at that  their hearts sank  since they all remembered what happened with the laestrygonians  their king antiphates  and how the mighty  cyclops devoured the men  they wept and wailed  and she would great floods of tears  but all that grieving could do no good  i made them wear their armor  and split them in two groups  i led one  and made godlike eurylochus lead the other  we shook the lots in a helmet made of bronze  eurylochus  lot jumped out  so he went with his band of twenty two  all weeping  those left behind with me were crying too  inside the glade they found the house of circe  built out of polished stones  on high foundations  round it were mountain wolves and lions  which she tamed with drugs  they did not rush on them  but gathered around them in a friendly way  their long tails wagging  as dogs nuzzle round their master when he comes back home from dinner with treats for them  just so  those sharp clawed wolves and lions  mighty beasts  came snuggling up  the men were terrified  they stood outside and heard some lovely singing  it was circe   the goddess  she was weaving as she sang  an intricate  enchanting piece of work  the kind a goddess fashions  then polites  my most devoted and most loyal man  a leader to his peers  said   friends  inside someone is weaving on that massive loom  and singing so the floor resounds  perhaps a woman  or a goddess  let us call her   they shouted out to her  she came at once  opened the shining doors  and asked them in   so thinking nothing of it  in they went  eurylochus alone remained outside  suspecting trickery  she led them in  sat them on chairs  and blended them a potion of barley  cheese  and golden honey  mixed with pramnian wine  she added potent drugs to make them totally forget their home  they took and drank the mixture  then she struck them  using her magic wand  and penned them in the pigsty  they were turned to pigs in body  and voice and hair  their minds remained the same  they squealed at their imprisonment  and circe threw them some mast and cornel cherries food that pigs like rooting for in muddy ground  eurylochus ran back to our black ship  to tell us of the terrible disaster that happened to his friends  he tried to speak  but could not  overwhelmed by grief  his eyes were full of tears  his heart was pierced with sorrow  astonished  we all questioned him  at last  he spoke about what happened to the others   odysseus  we went off through the woods  as you commanded  in the glade we found a beautiful tall house of polished stone  we heard a voice  a woman or a goddess was singing as she worked her loom  my friends called out to her  she opened up the doors  inviting them inside  suspecting nothing  they followed her  but i stayed there outside  fearing some trick  then all at once  they vanished   i sat there for a while to watch and wait  but none of them came back   at this  i strapped my silver studded sword across my back  took up my bow  and told him   take me there   he grasped my knees and begged me tearfully   no no  my lord  please do not make me go  let me stay here  you cannot bring them back  and you will not return here if you try  hurry  we must escape with these men here  we have a chance to save our lives   i said    you can stay here beside the ship and eat and drink  but i will go  i must do this   i left the ship and shore  and walked on up  crossing the sacred glades  and i had almost reached the great house of the enchantress circe  when i met hermes  carrying his wand of gold  he seemed an adolescent boy  the cutest age  when beards first start to grow  he took my hand and said   why have you come across these hills alone  you do not know  this place  poor man  your men were turned to pigs in circe s house  and crammed in pens  do you imagine you can set them free  you cannot  if you try that  you will not get back home  you will stay here with them  but i can help you  here  take this antidote to keep you safe when you go into circe s house  now i will tell you all her lethal spells and tricks  she will make you a potion mixed with poison  its magic will not work on you because  you have the herb i gave you  when she strikes you with her long wand  then draw your sharpened sword and rush at her as if you mean to kill her  she will be frightened of you  and will tell you to sleep with her  do not hold out against her  she is a goddess  if you sleep with her  you will set free your friends and save yourself  tell her to swear an oath by all the gods that she will not plot further harm for you  or while you have your clothes off  she may hurt you   unmanning you   the bright mercurial god pulled from the ground a plant and showed me how its root is black  its flower white as milk  the gods call this plant moly  it is hard for mortal men to dig it up  but gods are able to do everything  then hermes flew through the wooded island  back towards high mount olympus  i went in the house of circe  my heart pounded as i walked  i stood there at the doorway  and i saw her   the lovely circe with her braided hair  i called  she heard and opened up the doors and asked me in  i followed nervously  she led me to a silver studded chair  all finely crafted  with a footstool under  in a gold cup she mixed a drink for me  adding the drug she hoped to do me harm  i sipped it  but the magic did not work  she struck me with her wand and said   now go  out to the sty  and lie there with your men    but i drew my sharp sword from by my thigh and leapt at her as if i meant to kill her  she screamed and ducked beneath the sword  and grasped my knees  and wailing asked me   who are you  where is your city  and who are your parents  i am amazed that you could drink my potion and yet not be bewitched  no other man has drunk it and withstood the magic charm  but you are different  your mind is not enchanted  you must be odysseus   the man who can adapt to anything  bright flashing hermes of the golden wand has often told me that you would sail here from troy in your swift ship  now sheathe your sword and come to bed with me  through making love we may begin to trust each other more   i answered   circe  how can you command me to treat you gently  when you turned my men to pigs  and you are planning to play tricks in telling me to come to bed with you   so you can take my courage and my manhood when you have got me naked  i refuse to come to bed with you  unless you swear a mighty oath that you will not form plans to hurt me anymore   when i said that  at once she made the oath as i had asked  she vowed and formed the oath  and then at last i went up to the dazzling bed of circe  meanwhile  four slaves  her house girls  were at work around the palace  they were nymphs  the daughters  of fountains and of groves and holy rivers that flow into the sea  one set fine cloths of purple on the chairs  with stones beneath them  beside each chair  another pulled up tables of silver and set golden baskets on them  the third mixed up inside a silver bowl sweet  cheering wine  and poured it in gold cups  the fourth brought water  and she lit a fire beneath a mighty tripod  till it boiled  it started bubbling in the copper cauldron   she took me to the bathtub  and began to wash my head and shoulders  using water mixed to the perfect temperature  to take my deep soul crushing weariness away  after the bath  she oiled my skin and dressed me in fine wool cloak and tunic  and she led me to a silver studded well carved chair  and set a footstool underneath  another slave brought water for my hands  in a gold pitcher  and poured it over them  to a silver bowl   she set a polished table near  the cook brought bread and laid a generous feast  and circe told me to eat  but my heart was unwilling  i sat there with my mind on other things  i had forebodings  circe noticed me sitting  not touching food  and weighed by grief  she stood near me and asked   odysseus  why are you sitting there so silently  like someone mute  eating your heart  not touching the banquet or the wine  you need not fear   remember  i already swore an oath   but i said   circe  no  what decent man could bear to taste his food or sip his wine before he saw his men with his own eyes  and set them free  if you are so insistent on telling me to eat and drink  then free them  so i may see with my own eyes my crew of loyal men   so circe left the hall holding her wand  and opened up the pigsty and drove them out  still looking like fat boars   large and full grown  they stood in front of her  majestic lady circe walked among them  anointing each with some new drug  the potion had made thick hog hairs sprout out on their bodies  those bristles all flew off and they were men  but younger than before  and much more handsome  and taller  then they recognized me  each embraced me tightly in his arms  and started sobbing in desperation  so the house rang loud with noise  and even she herself  pitied them  she came near to me and said   odysseus  you always find solutions  go now to your swift ship beside the sea  first drag the ship to land  and bring your stores and all your gear inside the caves  then come back with your loyal men   my heart agreed  i went down to my swift ship on the shore  i found my loyal men beside the ship  weeping and shedding floods of tears  as when a herd of cows is coming back from pasture  into the yard  and all the little heifers jump from their pens to skip and run towards their mothers  and they cluster round them  mooing  just so my men  as soon as they saw me  began to weep  and in their minds it seemed as if they had arrived in their own home  the land of rugged ithaca  where they were born and raised  still sobbing  they cried out   oh  master  we are glad to see you back  it is as if we had come home ourselves   to ithaca  our fatherland  but tell us about how all our other friends were killed   i reassured them  saying   first we must drag up the ship to land  and put the stores and all our gear inside the caves  then hurry  all of you  come with me  and see your friends inside the goddess circe s holy house  eating and drinking  they have food enough to last forever   they believed my story  with the exception of eurylochus   who warned them   fools  why would you go up there  why would you choose to take on so much danger  to enter circe s house  where she will turn us to pigs or wolves or lions  all of us  forced to protect her mighty house for her  remember what the cyclops did  our friends went to his home with this rash lord of ours  because of his bad choices  they all died   at that  i thought of drawing my long sword from by my sturdy thigh  to cut his head off  and let it fall down to the ground although he was close family  my men restrained me  saying to me   no  king  please let him go  let him stay here and guard the ship  and we will follow you to circe s holy house   so they went up  away from ship and shore  eurylochus did not stay there  he came  fearing my angry scolding  meanwhile circe had freed the other men  and in her house she gently bathed them  rubbing them with oil   she had them dressed in woolen cloaks and tunics  we found them feasting in the hall  the men  seeing each other face to face again  began to weep  their sobbing filled the hall  the goddess stood beside me and said   king  clever odysseus  laertes  son  now stop encouraging this lamentation  i know you and your men have suffered greatly  out on the fish filled sea  and on dry land from hostile men  but it is time to eat  and drink some wine  you must get back the drive you had when you set out from ithaca  you are worn down and brokenhearted  always dwelling on pain and wandering  you never feel joy at heart  you have endured too much   we did as she had said  then every day for a whole year we feasted there on meat and sweet strong wine  but when the year was over  when months had waned and seasons turned  and each long day had passed its course  my loyal men  called me and said   be guided by the gods  now it is time to think of our own country  if you are fated to survive and reach your high roofed house and your forefathers  land   my warrior soul agreed  so all day long till sunset we kept sitting at the feast of meat and sweet strong wine  but when the sun set  and the darkness came  they went to bed all through the shadowy palace  i went up to circe s splendid bed  and touched her knees  in supplication  and the goddess listened   circe   i said   fulfill the vow you made to send me home  my heart now longs to go  my men are also desperate to leave  whenever you are absent  they exhaust me with constant lamentation   and she answered   laertes  son  great king odysseus  master of every challenge  you need not remain here in my house against your will  but first you must complete another journey   go to the house of hades and the dreadful persephone  and ask the theban prophet  the blind tiresias  for his advice  persephone has given him alone full understanding  even now in death  the other spirits flit around as shadows   that broke my heart  and sitting on the bed i wept  and lost all will to live and see the shining sun  when i was done with sobbing and rolling round in grief  i said to her    but circe  who can guide us on this journey  no one before has ever sailed to hades by ship   and right away the goddess answered   you are resourceful  king odysseus  you need not worry that you have no pilot to steer your ship  set up your mast  let fly your white sails  and sit down  the north wind s breath will blow the ship  when you have crossed the stream of ocean  you will reach the shore  where willows let fall their dying fruit  and towering poplars  grow in the forest of persephone  tie up your ship in the deep eddying ocean  and go into the spacious home of hades  the pyriphlegethon and cocytus  a tributary of the styx  both run into the acheron  the flowing water resounds beside the rock  brave man  go there  and dig a hole a cubit wide and long  and round it pour libations for the dead  first honey mix  then sweet wine  and the third  of water  sprinkle barley  and beseech the spirits of the dead  vow if you reach the barren land of ithaca  to kill a heifer in your halls  the best you have  uncalved  and you will heap the fire with meat  and offer to tiresias alone a ram  pure black  the best of all your flock  when you have prayed to all the famous dead  slaughter one ram and one black ewe  directing the animals to erebus  but turn  yourself away  towards the gushing river  many will come  then tell your men to skin the sheep that lie there killed by ruthless bronze  and burn them  with a prayer to mighty hades and terrible persephone  then draw your sword and sit  do not let them come near the blood  until you hear tiresias  the prophet will soon come  and he will tell you about your journey  measured out across the fish filled sea  and how you will get home    dawn on her golden throne began to shine  and circe dressed me in my cloak and tunic  the goddess wore a long white dress  of fine and delicate fabric  with a golden belt  and on her head  a veil  then i walked round  all through the house  and called my men  i stood beside each one  and roused them with my words   wake up  now no more dozing in sweet sleep  we have to go  the goddess gave instructions   they did as i had said  but even then  i could not lead my men away unharmed  the youngest one elpenor was his name  not very brave in war  nor very smart  was lying high up in the home of circe  apart from his companions  seeking coolness since he

meet tiresias  the theban spirit   at that  their hearts were broken  they sat down right there and wept and tore their clothes  but all their lamentation did no good  we went down to our speedy ship beside the sea  despite our grief  we she would abundant tears   then circe came and tied up one black ewe and one ram by the ship  and slipped away  easily  who can see the gods go by unless they

The dead  we reached the sea and first of all we launched the ship into the sparkling salty water, set up the mast and sails, and brought the sheep on board with us. we were still grieving, weeping, in floods of tears. but beautiful, dread circe, the goddess who can speak in human tongues, sent us a wind to fill our sails, fair wind befriending us behind the dark blue prow. we made our tackle shipshape, then sat down. the wind and pilot guided straight our course.

The sun set. it was dark in all directions. we reached the limits of deep-flowing ocean, where the cimmerians live and have their city. their land is covered up in mist and cloud; the shining sun god never looks on them with his bright beams not when he rises up into the starry sky, nor when he turns back from the heavens to earth. destructive night blankets the world for all poor mortals there. we beached our ship, drove out the sheep, and went

To seek the stream of ocean where the goddess had told us we must go. eurylochus and perimedes made the sacrifice. i drew my sword and dug a hole, a fathom widthways and lengthways, and i poured libations for all the dead: first honey-mix, sweet wine, and lastly, water. on the top, i sprinkled barley, and made a solemn vow that if i reached my homeland, i would sacrifice my best young heifer, still uncalved, and pile

The altar high with offerings for the dead. i promised for tiresias as well a pure black sheep, the best in all my flock. so with these vows, i called upon the dead. i took the sheep and slit their throats above the pit. black blood flowed out. the spirits came up out of erebus and gathered round. teenagers, girls and boys, the old who suffered for many years, and fresh young brides whom labor destroyed in youth; and many men cut down

In battle by bronze spears, still dressed in armor stained with their blood. from every side they crowded around the pit, with eerie cries. pale fear took hold of me. i roused my men and told them to flay the sheep that i had killed, and burn them, and pray to hades and persephone. i drew my sword and sat on guard, preventing the spirits of the dead from coming near the blood, till i had met tiresias. first came the spirit of my man elpenor,

Who had not yet been buried in the earth. we left his body in the house of circe without a funeral or burial; we were too occupied with other things. on sight of him, i wept in pity, saying,  elpenor, how did you come here, in darkness? you came on foot more quickly than i sailed.  he groaned in answer,  lord odysseus, you master every circumstance. but i had bad luck from some god, and too much wine

Befuddled me. in circe s house i lay upstairs, and i forgot to use the ladder to climb down from the roof. i fell headfirst; my neck was broken from my spine. my spirit came down to hades. by the men you left, the absent ones! and by your wife! and father, who brought you up from babyhood! and by your son, telemachus, whom you abandoned alone at home, i beg you! when you sail from hades and you dock your ship again

At aeaea, please my lord, remember me. do not go on and leave me there unburied, abandoned, without tears or lamentation  or you will make the gods enraged at you. burn me with all my arms, and heap a mound beside the gray salt sea, so in the future people will know of me and my misfortune. and fix into the tomb the oar i used to row with my companions while i lived.   poor man!  i answered,  i will do all this. 

We sat there talking sadly i on one side held firm my sword in blood, while on the other the ghost of my crew member made his speech. then came the spirit of my own dead mother, autolycus  daughter anticleia, whom i had left alive when i went off to holy troy. on seeing her, i wept in pity. but despite my bitter grief, i would not let her near the blood till i talked to tiresias. the prophet came

Holding a golden scepter, and he knew me, and said,  king under zeus, odysseus, adept survivor, why did you abandon the sun, poor man, to see the dead, and this place without joy? step back now from the pit, hold up your sharp sword so that i may drink the blood and speak to you.  at that, i sheathed my silver-studded sword. when he had drunk the murky blood, the famous prophet spoke.  odysseus, you think of going home

As honey-sweet, but gods will make it bitter. i think poseidon will not cease to feel incensed because you blinded his dear son. you have to suffer, but you can get home, if you control your urges and your men. turn from the purple depths and sail your ship towards the island of thrinacia; there you will find grazing cows and fine fat sheep, belonging to the god who sees and hears all things the sun god. if you leave them be,

Keeping your mind fixed on your journey home, you may still get to ithaca, despite great losses. but if you hurt those cows, i see disaster for your ship and for your men. if you yourself escape, you will come home late and exhausted, in a stranger s boat, having destroyed your men. and you will find invaders eating your supplies at home, courting your wife with gifts. then you will match the suitors  violence and kill them all,

Inside your halls, through tricks or in the open, with sharp bronze weapons. when those men are dead, you have to go away and take an oar to people with no knowledge of the sea, who do not salt their food. they never saw a ship s red prow, nor oars, the wings of boats. i prophesy the signs of things to come. when you meet somebody, a traveler, who calls the thing you carry on your back a winnowing fan, then fix that oar in earth

And make fine sacrifices to poseidon  a bull and stud-boar. then you will go home and offer holy hecatombs to all the deathless gods who live in heaven, each in order. gentle death will come to you, far from the sea, of comfortable old age, your people flourishing. so it will be.  i said,  tiresias, i hope the gods spin out this fate for me. but tell me this, and tell the truth. i saw my mother s spirit,

Sitting in silence near the blood, refusing even to talk to me, or meet my eyes! my lord, how can i make her recognize that it is me?  at once he made his answer.  that is an easy matter to explain. whenever you allow one of these spirits to come here near the blood, it will be able to speak the truth to you. as soon as you push them away, they have to leave again.  with that, tiresias, the prophet spirit,

Was finished; he departed to the house of hades. i stayed rooted there in place until my mother came and drank the blood. she knew me then and spoke in tones of grief.  my child! how did you come here through the darkness while you were still alive? this place is hard for living men to see. there are great rivers and dreadful gulfs, including the great ocean which none can cross on foot; one needs a ship. have you come wandering here, so far from troy,

With ship and crew? have you not yet arrived in ithaca, nor seen your wife at home?  i answered,  mother, i was forced to come to hades to consult the prophet spirit, theban tiresias. i have not yet come near to greece, nor reached my own home country. i have been lost and wretchedly unhappy since i first followed mighty agamemnon to troy, the land of horses, to make war upon the people there. but tell me, how

Was sad death brought upon you? by long illness? or did the archer artemis destroy you with gentle arrows? tell me too about my father and the son i left behind. are they still honored as the kings? or has another taken over, saying i will not return? and tell me what my wife is thinking, and her plans. does she stay with our son and focus on his care, or has the best of the achaeans married her? 

My mother answered,  she stays firm. her heart is strong. she is still in your house. and all her nights are passed in misery, and days in tears. but no one has usurped your throne. telemachus still tends the whole estate unharmed and feasts in style, as lords should do, and he is always asked to council meetings. your father stays out in the countryside. he will not come to town. he does not sleep on a real bed with blankets and fresh sheets.

In winter he sleeps inside, by the fire, just lying in the ashes with the slaves; his clothes are rags. in summer and at harvest, the piles of fallen leaves are beds for him. he lies there grieving, full of sorrow, longing for your return. his old age is not easy. and that is why i met my fate and died. the goddess did not shoot me in my home, aiming with gentle arrows. nor did sickness suck all the strength out from my limbs, with long

And cruel wasting. no, it was missing you, odysseus, my sunshine; your sharp mind, and your kind heart. that took sweet life from me.  then in my heart i wanted to embrace the spirit of my mother. she was dead, and i did not know how. three times i tried, longing to touch her. but three times her ghost flew from my arms, like shadows or like dreams. sharp pain pierced deeper in me as i cried,  no, mother! why do you not stay for me,

And let me hold you, even here in hades? let us wrap loving arms around each other and find a frigid comfort in shared tears! but is this really you? or has the queen sent me a phantom, to increase my grief?  she answered,  oh, my child! you are the most unlucky man alive. persephone is not deceiving you. this is the rule for mortals when we die. our muscles cease to hold the flesh and skeleton together;

As soon as life departs from our white bones, the force of blazing fire destroys the corpse. the spirit flies away and soon is gone, just like a dream. now hurry to the light; remember all these things, so you may tell your wife in times to come.  as we were talking, some women came, sent by persephone  the daughters and the wives of warriors. they thronged and clustered round the blood. i wanted to speak to each of them, and made a plan.

I drew my sword and would not let them come together in a group to drink the blood. they took turns coming forward, and each told her history; i questioned each. the first was well-born tyro, child of salmoneus, and wife of cretheus, aeolus  son. she fell in love with river enipeus, most handsome of all rivers that pour water over the earth. she often went to visit his lovely streams. poseidon took his form,

And at the river mouth he lay with her. around them arched a dark-blue wave that stood high as a mountain, and it hid the god and mortal woman. there he loosed her belt and made her sleep. the god made love to her, and afterwards, he took her hand and spoke.  woman, be glad about this love. you will bear glorious children in the coming year. affairs with gods always result in offspring. look after them and raise them. now go home;

Tell no one who i am. but i will tell you. i am poseidon, shaker of the earth.  with that he sank beneath the ocean waves. she brought two sons to term, named pelias and neleus, both sturdy boys who served almighty zeus; and pelias  home was on the spacious dancing fields of iolcus, where sheep are plentiful; his brother lived in sandy pylos. and she bore more sons, to cretheus: aeson, pheres, amythaeon

Who loved war chariots. and after her i saw antiope, who said she slept in zeus  arms and bore two sons: amphion and zethus, the first settlers of thebes, city of seven gates. strong though they were, they could not live there on the open plain without defenses. then i saw alcmene, wife of amphitryon, who by great zeus conceived the lionhearted heracles. and i saw megara, proud creon s child,

The wife of tireless heracles. i saw fine epicaste, oedipus  mother, who did a dreadful thing in ignorance: she married her own son. he killed his father, and married her. the gods revealed the truth to humans; through their deadly plans, he ruled the cadmeans in thebes, despite his pain. but epicaste crossed the gates of hades; she tied a noose and hung it from the ceiling, and hanged herself for sorrow, leaving him

The agonies a mother s furies bring. then i saw chloris, who was youngest daughter of amphion, who ruled the minyans in orchomenus. she was beautiful, and neleus paid rich bride-gifts for her. she was the queen in pylos, and she bore chromius, nestor, periclymenus, and mighty pyro, who was such a marvel that all the men desired to marry her. but neleus would only let her marry

A man who could drive off the stubborn cattle of iphicles from phylace. the prophet melampus was the only one who tried, but gods restrained him, cursing him; the herdsmen shackled him. days and months went by, the seasons changed as the year went by, until at last iphicles set him free as his reward for prophecy. the will of zeus was done. and then i saw tyndareus  wife, leda, who bore him two strong sons: the horseman

Castor, and polydeuces, skillful boxer. life-giving earth contains them, still alive. zeus honors them even in the underworld. they live and die alternately, and they are honored like the gods. and then i saw iphimedeia, wife of aloeus, who proudly said poseidon slept with her. she had two sons whose lives were both cut short: otus and famous ephialtes, whom the fertile earth raised up as the tallest heroes

After renowned orion. at nine years, they were nine cubits wide, nine fathoms high. they brought the din of dreadful raging war to the immortal gods and tried to set ossa and pelion trees, leaves and all  on mount olympus, high up in the sky. they might have managed it, if they had reached full adulthood. apollo, son of zeus by braided leto, killed them: they were both dead before down could grow on their young chins,

Dead before beards could wreathe their naked faces. then i saw phaedra, procris, and the lovely daughter of dangerous minos, ariadne. theseus tried to bring her back from crete to athens, but could not succeed; the goddess artemis killed her on the isle of d a, when dionysus spoke against her. then came maera, clymene and eriphyle: accepting golden bribes, she killed her husband. i cannot name each famous wife and daughter

I saw there; holy night would pass away before i finished. i must go to sleep on board the ship beside my crew, or else right here. i know the gods and you will help my onward journey.  they were silent, spellbound, listening in the shadowy hall. white-armed arete spoke.  phaeacians! look at him! what a tall, handsome man! and what a mind! he is my special guest, but all of you share in our rank as lords; so do not send him

Away too fast, and when he leaves, you must be generous. he is in need, and you are rich in treasure, through the will of gods.  the veteran echeneus, the oldest man in their company, said,  our wise queen has hit the mark, my friends. do as she says. but first alcinous must speak and act.  the king said,  let it be as she has spoken, as long as i am ruler of this nation of seafarers. i know our guest is keen

To go back home, but let him stay till morning. i will give all his presents then. you men will all help him, but i will help the most, since i hold power here.  odysseus answered with careful tact,  alcinous, king over all the people, if you urged me to stay here for a year before you gave the parting gifts and sent me on my way, i would be happy. it would be far better to reach my own dear home with hands filled full

Of treasure. so all men would honor me and welcome me back home in ithaca.  alcinous replied,  odysseus, the earth sustains all different kinds of people. many are cheats and thieves, who fashion lies out of thin air. but when i look at you, i know you are not in that category. your story has both grace and wisdom in it. you sounded like a skillful poet, telling the sufferings of all the greeks, including

What you endured yourself. but come now, tell me if you saw any spirits of your friends, who went with you to troy and undertook the grief and pain of war. the night is long; it is not time to sleep yet. tell me more amazing deeds! i would keep listening until bright daybreak, if you kept on telling the dangers you have passed.  odysseus answered politely,  king alcinous, it is a time for many tales, but also

A time for sleep. if you still want to hear, i will not grudge you stories. i will tell you some even more distressing ones, about my friend who managed to escape the shrieks and battle din at troy but perished later, killed in his own home by an evil wife. holy persephone dispersed the ghosts of women and they went their separate ways. the ghost of agamemnon came in sorrow with all the rest who met their fate with him

Inside aegisthus  house. he recognized me when he had drunk the blood. he wept out loud, and tearfully reached out his hands towards me, desperate to touch. his energy and strength and all the suppleness his limbs once had were gone. i wept and my heart pitied him. i cried out,  lord of men, king agamemnon! how did you die? what bad luck brought you down? was it poseidon rousing up a blast of cruel wind to wreck your ships? or were you

Killed on dry land by enemies as you were poaching their fat flocks of sheep or cattle, or fighting for their city and their wives?  he answered right away,  king under zeus, odysseus survivor! no, poseidon did not rouse up a dreadful blast of wind to wreck my ship. no hostile men on land killed me in self-defense. it was aegisthus who planned my death and murdered me, with help from my own wife. he called me to his house

To dinner and he killed me, as one slaughters an ox at manger. what a dreadful death! my men were systematically slaughtered like pigs in a rich lord s house for some feast, a wedding or a banquet. you have seen many cut down in war in thick of battle, or slaughtered in a combat hand to hand; but you would grieve with even deeper pity if you could see us lying dead beneath the tables piled with food and wine. the floor

Swam thick with blood. i heard the desperate voice of priam s daughter, poor cassandra, whom deceitful clytemnestra killed beside me. as i lay dying, struck through by the sword, i tried to lift my arms up from the ground. that she-dog turned away. i went to hades. she did not even shut my eyes or close my mouth. there is no more disgusting act than when a wife betrays a man like that. that woman formed a plot to murder me!

Her husband! when i got back home, i thought i would be welcomed, at least by my slaves and children. she has such an evil mind that she has poured down shame on her own head and on all other women, even good ones.  i cried out,  curse her! zeus has always brought disaster to the house of atreus through women. many men were lost for helen, and clytemnestra formed this plot against you when you were far away.  at once he answered,

 so you must never treat your wife too well. do not let her know everything you know. tell her some things, hide others. but your wife will not kill you, odysseus. the wise penelope is much too sensible to do such things. your bride was very young when we went off to war. she had a baby still at her breast, who must be now a man. he will be glad when you come home and see him, and he will throw his arms around his father.

That is how things should go. my wife prevented my eager eyes from gazing at my son. she killed me first. i have a final piece of sound advice for you take heed of it. when you arrive in your own land, do not anchor your ship in full view; move in secret. there is no trusting women any longer. but have you any news about my son? is he alive? is he in orchomenus, or sandy pylos, or with menelaus

In sparta? surely my fine son orestes is not yet dead.  i answered,  agamemnon, why ask me this? i do not even know whether he is alive or dead. it is pointless to talk of hypotheticals.  both of us wept profusely, deeply grieving over the bitter words we spoke. then came the spirits of achilles and patroclus and of antilochus and ajax, who was handsomest and had the best physique,

Of all the greeks, next only to achilles the sprinter. and achilles recognized me and spoke in tears.  my lord odysseus, you fox! what will you think of next? how could you bear to come down to hades? numb dead people live here, the shades of poor exhausted mortals.  i said,  achilles, greatest of greek heroes, i came down here to meet tiresias, in case he had advice for my return to rocky ithaca. i have not even

Reached greece, let alone my homeland. i have had bad luck. but no one s luck was ever better than yours, nor ever will be. in your life we greeks respected you as we do gods, and now that you are here, you have great power among the dead. achilles, you should not be bitter at your death.  but he replied,  odysseus, you must not comfort me for death. i would prefer to be a workman, hired by a poor man on a peasant farm,

Than rule as king of all the dead. but come, tell me about my son. do you have news? did he march off to war to be a leader? and what about my father peleus? does he still have good standing among all the myrmidons? or do they treat him badly in phthia and greece, since he is old and frail? now i have left the light of day, and am not there to help, as on the plains of troy when i was killing the best trojans,

To help the greeks. if i could go for even a little while, with all that strength i had, up to my father s house, i would make those who hurt and disrespect him wish my hands were not invincible.  i answered him,  i have no news to tell about your father, but i can tell you all about your son, dear neoptolemus. i brought him from scyros by ship, with other well-armed greeks. when we were strategizing about troy,

He always spoke up first and to the purpose, unmatched except by nestor and myself. and when we fought at troy, he never paused in the great throng of battle; he was always fearlessly running forward, and he slaughtered enormous numbers in the clash of war. i cannot name all those he killed for us. but with his bronze he cut down eurypylus, the son of telephus, most handsome man i ever saw, next only to great memnon.

The multitude of cetians he brought were also killed, since priam bribed his mother. when we, the argive leaders, were preparing to climb inside the wooden horse, it was my task to open up and close the door. the other greek commanders were in tears; their legs were shaking. not your handsome boy! i never saw his face grow pale; he had no tears to wipe away. inside the horse, he begged me to allow him to jump out.

He gripped his sword hilt and his heavy spear, so desperate to go hurt the trojans. at last, when we had sacked the lofty city of priam, he embarked weighed down with spoils. no sharp bronze spear had wounded him at all; he was unhurt by all the skirmishes endured in war when ares rages blind.  after i told him this, achilles  ghost took great swift-footed strides across the fields of asphodel, delighted to have heard

About the glorious prowess of his son. other dead souls were gathering, all sad; each told the story of his sorrow. only ajax kept back, enraged because i won achilles  armor, when the case was judged beside the ships. the hero s mother, thetis, and sons of troy, and pallas, gave the arms to me. i wish i had not won this contest! for those arms ajax lies beneath the earth, whose looks and deeds were best of all the greeks

After achilles, son of peleus. i spoke to him to try to make it up.  please, ajax, son of mighty telamon, can you not set aside your rage at me about those cursed arms? not even now, in death? the gods made them to ruin us. you were our tower; what a loss you were! we greeks were struck by grief when you were gone; we mourned as long for you as for achilles. blame nobody but zeus. he ruined us,

In hatred for the army of the greeks; and that was why he brought this doom on you. but listen now, my lord. subdue your anger.  he did not answer. he went off and followed the spirits of the dead to erebus. despite his rage, we might have spoken longer if i had not felt in my heart an urge to see more spirits. i saw minos there, the son of zeus, who holds the golden scepter and sits in judgment on the dead. they ask

Their king to arbitrate disputes, inside the house of hades, where the doors are always wide open. i saw great orion, chasing across the fields of asphodel the beasts he killed when living high in lonely mountains, holding his indestructible bronze club. and i saw tityus, the son of gaia, stretched out nine miles. when leto, zeus  lover, was traveling to pytho, through the fields of beautiful panopeus, he raped her.

Two vultures sit on either side of him, ripping his liver, plunging in his bowels; he fails to push them off. i saw the pain of tantalus, in water to his chin, so parched, no way to drink. when that old man bent down towards the water, it was gone; some god had dried it up, and at his feet dark earth appeared. tall leafy trees hung fruit above his head: sweet figs and pomegranates and brightly shining apples and ripe olives.

But when he grasped them with his hands, the wind hurled them away towards the shadowy clouds. and i saw sisyphus in torment, pushing a giant rock with both hands, leaning on it with all his might to shove it up towards a hilltop; when he almost reached the peak, its weight would swerve, and it would roll back down, heedlessly. but he kept on straining, pushing, his body drenched in sweat, his head all dusty. i saw a phantom of great heracles.

The man himself is with the deathless gods, happy and feasting, with fine-ankled hebe, the child of mighty zeus and golden hera. around his ghost, the dead souls shrieked like birds, all panic-struck. he walked like gloomy night, holding his bow uncased and with an arrow held on the string. he glowered terribly, poised for a shot. around his chest was strapped a terrifying baldric made of gold, fashioned with marvelous images of bears,

Wild boars, and lions with fierce staring eyes, and battles and the slaughtering of men. i hope the craftsman who designed this scene will never make another work like this. this heracles at once knew who i was, and full of grief he cried,  odysseus! master of every circumstance, so you are also tortured by the weight of fortune as i was while i lived beneath the sun? i was a son of zeus, and yet my pain

Was infinite. i was enslaved to someone far less heroic than myself, who laid harsh labors on me. once he sent me here to bring back cerberus, since he could think of no worse task for me. i brought the dog up out of hades, with the help of hermes, and flashing-eyed athena.  he went back to hades  house. i stayed, in case more heroes who died in ancient times should come to me. i would have seen the noble men i hoped for,

Pirithous and theseus, god-born. but masses of the dead came thronging round with eerie cries, and cold fear seized me, lest the dreadful queen persephone might send the monster s head, the gorgon, out of hades. so then i hurried back and told my men to climb on board the ship and loose the cables. they did so, and sat down along the benches. the current bore the ship down river ocean, first with the help of oars, and then fair wind.",the dead  we reached the sea and first of all we launched the ship into the sparkling salty water  set up the mast and sails  and brought the sheep on board with us  we were still grieving  weeping  in floods of tears  but beautiful  dread circe  the goddess who can speak in human tongues  sent us a wind to fill our sails  fair wind befriending us behind the dark blue prow  we made our tackle shipshape  then sat down  the wind and pilot guided straight our course   the sun set  it was dark in all directions  we reached the limits of deep flowing ocean  where the cimmerians live and have their city  their land is covered up in mist and cloud  the shining sun god never looks on them with his bright beams not when he rises up into the starry sky  nor when he turns back from the heavens to earth  destructive night blankets the world for all poor mortals there  we beached our ship  drove out the sheep  and went  to seek the stream of ocean where the goddess had told us we must go  eurylochus and perimedes made the sacrifice  i drew my sword and dug a hole  a fathom widthways and lengthways  and i poured libations for all the dead  first honey mix  sweet wine  and lastly  water  on the top  i sprinkled barley  and made a solemn vow that if i reached my homeland  i would sacrifice my best young heifer  still uncalved  and pile  the altar high with offerings for the dead  i promised for tiresias as well a pure black sheep  the best in all my flock  so with these vows  i called upon the dead  i took the sheep and slit their throats above the pit  black blood flowed out  the spirits came up out of erebus and gathered round  teenagers  girls and boys  the old who suffered for many years  and fresh young brides whom labor destroyed in youth  and many men cut down  in battle by bronze spears  still dressed in armor stained with their blood  from every side they crowded around the pit  with eerie cries  pale fear took hold of me  i roused my men and told them to flay the sheep that i had killed  and burn them  and pray to hades and persephone  i drew my sword and sat on guard  preventing the spirits of the dead from coming near the blood  till i had met tiresias  first came the spirit of my man elpenor   who had not yet been buried in the earth  we left his body in the house of circe without a funeral or burial  we were too occupied with other things  on sight of him  i wept in pity  saying   elpenor  how did you come here  in darkness  you came on foot more quickly than i sailed   he groaned in answer   lord odysseus  you master every circumstance  but i had bad luck from some god  and too much wine  befuddled me  in circe s house i lay upstairs  and i forgot to use the ladder to climb down from the roof  i fell headfirst  my neck was broken from my spine  my spirit came down to hades  by the men you left  the absent ones  and by your wife  and father  who brought you up from babyhood  and by your son  telemachus  whom you abandoned alone at home  i beg you  when you sail from hades and you dock your ship again  at aeaea  please my lord  remember me  do not go on and leave me there unburied  abandoned  without tears or lamentation  or you will make the gods enraged at you  burn me with all my arms  and heap a mound beside the gray salt sea  so in the future people will know of me and my misfortune  and fix into the tomb the oar i used to row with my companions while i lived    poor man   i answered   i will do all this    we sat there talking sadly i on one side held firm my sword in blood  while on the other the ghost of my crew member made his speech  then came the spirit of my own dead mother  autolycus  daughter anticleia  whom i had left alive when i went off to holy troy  on seeing her  i wept in pity  but despite my bitter grief  i would not let her near the blood till i talked to tiresias  the prophet came  holding a golden scepter  and he knew me  and said   king under zeus  odysseus  adept survivor  why did you abandon the sun  poor man  to see the dead  and this place without joy  step back now from the pit  hold up your sharp sword so that i may drink the blood and speak to you   at that  i sheathed my silver studded sword  when he had drunk the murky blood  the famous prophet spoke   odysseus  you think of going home  as honey sweet  but gods will make it bitter  i think poseidon will not cease to feel incensed because you blinded his dear son  you have to suffer  but you can get home  if you control your urges and your men  turn from the purple depths and sail your ship towards the island of thrinacia  there you will find grazing cows and fine fat sheep  belonging to the god who sees and hears all things the sun god  if you leave them be   keeping your mind fixed on your journey home  you may still get to ithaca  despite great losses  but if you hurt those cows  i see disaster for your ship and for your men  if you yourself escape  you will come home late and exhausted  in a stranger s boat  having destroyed your men  and you will find invaders eating your supplies at home  courting your wife with gifts  then you will match the suitors  violence and kill them all   inside your halls  through tricks or in the open  with sharp bronze weapons  when those men are dead  you have to go away and take an oar to people with no knowledge of the sea  who do not salt their food  they never saw a ship s red prow  nor oars  the wings of boats  i prophesy the signs of things to come  when you meet somebody  a traveler  who calls the thing you carry on your back a winnowing fan  then fix that oar in earth  and make fine sacrifices to poseidon  a bull and stud boar  then you will go home and offer holy hecatombs to all the deathless gods who live in heaven  each in order  gentle death will come to you  far from the sea  of comfortable old age  your people flourishing  so it will be   i said   tiresias  i hope the gods spin out this fate for me  but tell me this  and tell the truth  i saw my mother s spirit   sitting in silence near the blood  refusing even to talk to me  or meet my eyes  my lord  how can i make her recognize that it is me   at once he made his answer   that is an easy matter to explain  whenever you allow one of these spirits to come here near the blood  it will be able to speak the truth to you  as soon as you push them away  they have to leave again   with that  tiresias  the prophet spirit   was finished  he departed to the house of hades  i stayed rooted there in place until my mother came and drank the blood  she knew me then and spoke in tones of grief   my child  how did you come here through the darkness while you were still alive  this place is hard for living men to see  there are great rivers and dreadful gulfs  including the great ocean which none can cross on foot  one needs a ship  have you come wandering here  so far from troy   with ship and crew  have you not yet arrived in ithaca  nor seen your wife at home   i answered   mother  i was forced to come to hades to consult the prophet spirit  theban tiresias  i have not yet come near to greece  nor reached my own home country  i have been lost and wretchedly unhappy since i first followed mighty agamemnon to troy  the land of horses  to make war upon the people there  but tell me  how  was sad death brought upon you  by long illness  or did the archer artemis destroy you with gentle arrows  tell me too about my father and the son i left behind  are they still honored as the kings  or has another taken over  saying i will not return  and tell me what my wife is thinking  and her plans  does she stay with our son and focus on his care  or has the best of the achaeans married her    my mother answered   she stays firm  her heart is strong  she is still in your house  and all her nights are passed in misery  and days in tears  but no one has usurped your throne  telemachus still tends the whole estate unharmed and feasts in style  as lords should do  and he is always asked to council meetings  your father stays out in the countryside  he will not come to town  he does not sleep on a real bed with blankets and fresh sheets   in winter he sleeps inside  by the fire  just lying in the ashes with the slaves  his clothes are rags  in summer and at harvest  the piles of fallen leaves are beds for him  he lies there grieving  full of sorrow  longing for your return  his old age is not easy  and that is why i met my fate and died  the goddess did not shoot me in my home  aiming with gentle arrows  nor did sickness suck all the strength out from my limbs  with long  and cruel wasting  no  it was missing you  odysseus  my sunshine  your sharp mind  and your kind heart  that took sweet life from me   then in my heart i wanted to embrace the spirit of my mother  she was dead  and i did not know how  three times i tried  longing to touch her  but three times her ghost flew from my arms  like shadows or like dreams  sharp pain pierced deeper in me as i cried   no  mother  why do you not stay for me   and let me hold you  even here in hades  let us wrap loving arms around each other and find a frigid comfort in shared tears  but is this really you  or has the queen sent me a phantom  to increase my grief   she answered   oh  my child  you are the most unlucky man alive  persephone is not deceiving you  this is the rule for mortals when we die  our muscles cease to hold the flesh and skeleton together   as soon as life departs from our white bones  the force of blazing fire destroys the corpse  the spirit flies away and soon is gone  just like a dream  now hurry to the light  remember all these things  so you may tell your wife in times to come   as we were talking  some women came  sent by persephone  the daughters and the wives of warriors  they thronged and clustered round the blood  i wanted to speak to each of them  and made a plan   i drew my sword and would not let them come together in a group to drink the blood  they took turns coming forward  and each told her history  i questioned each  the first was well born tyro  child of salmoneus  and wife of cretheus  aeolus  son  she fell in love with river enipeus  most handsome of all rivers that pour water over the earth  she often went to visit his lovely streams  poseidon took his form   and at the river mouth he lay with her  around them arched a dark blue wave that stood high as a mountain  and it hid the god and mortal woman  there he loosed her belt and made her sleep  the god made love to her  and afterwards  he took her hand and spoke   woman  be glad about this love  you will bear glorious children in the coming year  affairs with gods always result in offspring  look after them and raise them  now go home   tell no one who i am  but i will tell you  i am poseidon  shaker of the earth   with that he sank beneath the ocean waves  she brought two sons to term  named pelias and neleus  both sturdy boys who served almighty zeus  and pelias  home was on the spacious dancing fields of iolcus  where sheep are plentiful  his brother lived in sandy pylos  and she bore more sons  to cretheus  aeson  pheres  amythaeon  who loved war chariots  and after her i saw antiope  who said she slept in zeus  arms and bore two sons  amphion and zethus  the first settlers of thebes  city of seven gates  strong though they were  they could not live there on the open plain without defenses  then i saw alcmene  wife of amphitryon  who by great zeus conceived the lionhearted heracles  and i saw megara  proud creon s child   the wife of tireless heracles  i saw fine epicaste  oedipus  mother  who did a dreadful thing in ignorance  she married her own son  he killed his father  and married her  the gods revealed the truth to humans  through their deadly plans  he ruled the cadmeans in thebes  despite his pain  but epicaste crossed the gates of hades  she tied a noose and hung it from the ceiling  and hanged herself for sorrow  leaving him  the agonies a mother s furies bring  then i saw chloris  who was youngest daughter of amphion  who ruled the minyans in orchomenus  she was beautiful  and neleus paid rich bride gifts for her  she was the queen in pylos  and she bore chromius  nestor  periclymenus  and mighty pyro  who was such a marvel that all the men desired to marry her  but neleus would only let her marry  a man who could drive off the stubborn cattle of iphicles from phylace  the prophet melampus was the only one who tried  but gods restrained him  cursing him  the herdsmen shackled him  days and months went by  the seasons changed as the year went by  until at last iphicles set him free as his reward for prophecy  the will of zeus was done  and then i saw tyndareus  wife  leda  who bore him two strong sons  the horseman  castor  and polydeuces  skillful boxer  life giving earth contains them  still alive  zeus honors them even in the underworld  they live and die alternately  and they are honored like the gods  and then i saw iphimedeia  wife of aloeus  who proudly said poseidon slept with her  she had two sons whose lives were both cut short  otus and famous ephialtes  whom the fertile earth raised up as the tallest heroes  after renowned orion  at nine years  they were nine cubits wide  nine fathoms high  they brought the din of dreadful raging war to the immortal gods and tried to set ossa and pelion trees  leaves and all  on mount olympus  high up in the sky  they might have managed it  if they had reached full adulthood  apollo  son of zeus by braided leto  killed them  they were both dead before down could grow on their young chins   dead before beards could wreathe their naked faces  then i saw phaedra  procris  and the lovely daughter of dangerous minos  ariadne  theseus tried to bring her back from crete to athens  but could not succeed  the goddess artemis killed her on the isle of d a  when dionysus spoke against her  then came maera  clymene and eriphyle  accepting golden bribes  she killed her husband  i cannot name each famous wife and daughter  i saw there  holy night would pass away before i finished  i must go to sleep on board the ship beside my crew  or else right here  i know the gods and you will help my onward journey   they were silent  spellbound  listening in the shadowy hall  white armed arete spoke   phaeacians  look at him  what a tall  handsome man  and what a mind  he is my special guest  but all of you share in our rank as lords  so do not send him  away too fast  and when he leaves  you must be generous  he is in need  and you are rich in treasure  through the will of gods   the veteran echeneus  the oldest man in their company  said   our wise queen has hit the mark  my friends  do as she says  but first alcinous must speak and act   the king said   let it be as she has spoken  as long as i am ruler of this nation of seafarers  i know our guest is keen  to go back home  but let him stay till morning  i will give all his presents then  you men will all help him  but i will help the most  since i hold power here   odysseus answered with careful tact   alcinous  king over all the people  if you urged me to stay here for a year before you gave the parting gifts and sent me on my way  i would be happy  it would be far better to reach my own dear home with hands filled full  of treasure  so all men would honor me and welcome me back home in ithaca   alcinous replied   odysseus  the earth sustains all different kinds of people  many are cheats and thieves  who fashion lies out of thin air  but when i look at you  i know you are not in that category  your story has both grace and wisdom in it  you sounded like a skillful poet  telling the sufferings of all the greeks  including  what you endured yourself  but come now  tell me if you saw any spirits of your friends  who went with you to troy and undertook the grief and pain of war  the night is long  it is not time to sleep yet  tell me more amazing deeds  i would keep listening until bright daybreak  if you kept on telling the dangers you have passed   odysseus answered politely   king alcinous  it is a time for many tales  but also  a time for sleep  if you still want to hear  i will not grudge you stories  i will tell you some even more distressing ones  about my friend who managed to escape the shrieks and battle din at troy but perished later  killed in his own home by an evil wife  holy persephone dispersed the ghosts of women and they went their separate ways  the ghost of agamemnon came in sorrow with all the rest who met their fate with him  inside aegisthus  house  he recognized me when he had drunk the blood  he wept out loud  and tearfully reached out his hands towards me  desperate to touch  his energy and strength and all the suppleness his limbs once had were gone  i wept and my heart pitied him  i cried out   lord of men  king agamemnon  how did you die  what bad luck brought you down  was it poseidon rousing up a blast of cruel wind to wreck your ships  or were you  killed on dry land by enemies as you were poaching their fat flocks of sheep or cattle  or fighting for their city and their wives   he answered right away   king under zeus  odysseus survivor  no  poseidon did not rouse up a dreadful blast of wind to wreck my ship  no hostile men on land killed me in self defense  it was aegisthus who planned my death and murdered me  with help from my own wife  he called me to his house  to dinner and he killed me  as one slaughters an ox at manger  what a dreadful death  my men were systematically slaughtered like pigs in a rich lord s house for some feast  a wedding or a banquet  you have seen many cut down in war in thick of battle  or slaughtered in a combat hand to hand  but you would grieve with even deeper pity if you could see us lying dead beneath the tables piled with food and wine  the floor  swam thick with blood  i heard the desperate voice of priam s daughter  poor cassandra  whom deceitful clytemnestra killed beside me  as i lay dying  struck through by the sword  i tried to lift my arms up from the ground  that she dog turned away  i went to hades  she did not even shut my eyes or close my mouth  there is no more disgusting act than when a wife betrays a man like that  that woman formed a plot to murder me   her husband  when i got back home  i thought i would be welcomed  at least by my slaves and children  she has such an evil mind that she has poured down shame on her own head and on all other women  even good ones   i cried out   curse her  zeus has always brought disaster to the house of atreus through women  many men were lost for helen  and clytemnestra formed this plot against you when you were far away   at once he answered    so you must never treat your wife too well  do not let her know everything you know  tell her some things  hide others  but your wife will not kill you  odysseus  the wise penelope is much too sensible to do such things  your bride was very young when we went off to war  she had a baby still at her breast  who must be now a man  he will be glad when you come home and see him  and he will throw his arms around his father   that is how things should go  my wife prevented my eager eyes from gazing at my son  she killed me first  i have a final piece of sound advice for you take heed of it  when you arrive in your own land  do not anchor your ship in full view  move in secret  there is no trusting women any longer  but have you any news about my son  is he alive  is he in orchomenus  or sandy pylos  or with menelaus  in sparta  surely my fine son orestes is not yet dead   i answered   agamemnon  why ask me this  i do not even know whether he is alive or dead  it is pointless to talk of hypotheticals   both of us wept profusely  deeply grieving over the bitter words we spoke  then came the spirits of achilles and patroclus and of antilochus and ajax  who was handsomest and had the best physique   of all the greeks  next only to achilles the sprinter  and achilles recognized me and spoke in tears   my lord odysseus  you fox  what will you think of next  how could you bear to come down to hades  numb dead people live here  the shades of poor exhausted mortals   i said   achilles  greatest of greek heroes  i came down here to meet tiresias  in case he had advice for my return to rocky ithaca  i have not even  reached greece  let alone my homeland  i have had bad luck  but no one s luck was ever better than yours  nor ever will be  in your life we greeks respected you as we do gods  and now that you are here  you have great power among the dead  achilles  you should not be bitter at your death   but he replied   odysseus  you must not comfort me for death  i would prefer to be a workman  hired by a poor man on a peasant farm   than rule as king of all the dead  but come  tell me about my son  do you have news  did he march off to war to be a leader  and what about my father peleus  does he still have good standing among all the myrmidons  or do they treat him badly in phthia and greece  since he is old and frail  now i have left the light of day  and am not there to help  as on the plains of troy when i was killing the best trojans   to help the greeks  if i could go for even a little while  with all that strength i had  up to my father s house  i would make those who hurt and disrespect him wish my hands were not invincible   i answered him   i have no news to tell about your father  but i can tell you all about your son  dear neoptolemus  i brought him from scyros by ship  with other well armed greeks  when we were strategizing about troy   he always spoke up first and to the purpose  unmatched except by nestor and myself  and when we fought at troy  he never paused in the great throng of battle  he was always fearlessly running forward  and he slaughtered enormous numbers in the clash of war  i cannot name all those he killed for us  but with his bronze he cut down eurypylus  the son of telephus  most handsome man i ever saw  next only to great memnon   the multitude of cetians he brought were also killed  since priam bribed his mother  when we  the argive leaders  were preparing to climb inside the wooden horse  it was my task to open up and close the door  the other greek commanders were in tears  their legs were shaking  not your handsome boy  i never saw his face grow pale  he had no tears to wipe away  inside the horse  he begged me to allow him to jump out   he gripped his sword hilt and his heavy spear  so desperate to go hurt the trojans  at last  when we had sacked the lofty city of priam  he embarked weighed down with spoils  no sharp bronze spear had wounded him at all  he was unhurt by all the skirmishes endured in war when ares rages blind   after i told him this  achilles  ghost took great swift footed strides across the fields of asphodel  delighted to have heard  about the glorious prowess of his son  other dead souls were gathering  all sad  each told the story of his sorrow  only ajax kept back  enraged because i won achilles  armor  when the case was judged beside the ships  the hero s mother  thetis  and sons of troy  and pallas  gave the arms to me  i wish i had not won this contest  for those arms ajax lies beneath the earth  whose looks and deeds were best of all the greeks  after achilles  son of peleus  i spoke to him to try to make it up   please  ajax  son of mighty telamon  can you not set aside your rage at me about those cursed arms  not even now  in death  the gods made them to ruin us  you were our tower  what a loss you were  we greeks were struck by grief when you were gone  we mourned as long for you as for achilles  blame nobody but zeus  he ruined us   in hatred for the army of the greeks  and that was why he brought this doom on you  but listen now  my lord  subdue your anger   he did not answer  he went off and followed the spirits of the dead to erebus  despite his rage  we might have spoken longer if i had not felt in my heart an urge to see more spirits  i saw minos there  the son of zeus  who holds the golden scepter and sits in judgment on the dead  they ask  their king to arbitrate disputes  inside the house of hades  where the doors are always wide open  i saw great orion  chasing across the fields of asphodel the beasts he killed when living high in lonely mountains  holding his indestructible bronze club  and i saw tityus  the son of gaia  stretched out nine miles  when leto  zeus  lover  was traveling to pytho  through the fields of beautiful panopeus  he raped her   two vultures sit on either side of him  ripping his liver  plunging in his bowels  he fails to push them off  i saw the pain of tantalus  in water to his chin  so parched  no way to drink  when that old man bent down towards the water  it was gone  some god had dried it up  and at his feet dark earth appeared  tall leafy trees hung fruit above his head  sweet figs and pomegranates and brightly shining apples and ripe olives   but when he grasped them with his hands  the wind hurled them away towards the shadowy clouds  and i saw sisyphus in torment  pushing a giant rock with both hands  leaning on it with all his might to shove it up towards a hilltop  when he almost reached the peak  its weight would swerve  and it would roll back down  heedlessly  but he kept on straining  pushing  his body drenched in sweat  his head all dusty  i saw a phantom of great heracles   the man himself is with the deathless gods  happy and feasting  with fine ankled hebe  the child of mighty zeus and golden hera  around his ghost  the dead souls shrieked like birds  all panic struck  he walked like gloomy night  holding his bow uncased and with an arrow held on the string  he glowered terribly  poised for a shot  around his chest was strapped a terrifying baldric made of gold  fashioned with marvelous images of bears   wild boars  and lions with fierce staring eyes  and battles and the slaughtering of men  i hope the craftsman who designed this scene will never make another work like this  this heracles at once knew who i was  and full of grief he cried   odysseus  master of every circumstance  so you are also tortured by the weight of fortune as i was while i lived beneath the sun  i was a son of zeus  and yet my pain  was infinite  i was enslaved to someone far less heroic than myself  who laid harsh labors on me  once he sent me here to bring back cerberus  since he could think of no worse task for me  i brought the dog up out of hades  with the help of hermes  and flashing eyed athena   he went back to hades  house  i stayed  in case more heroes who died in ancient times should come to me  i would have seen the noble men i hoped for   pirithous and theseus  god born  but masses of the dead came thronging round with eerie cries  and cold fear seized me  lest the dreadful queen persephone might send the monster s head  the gorgon  out of hades  so then i hurried back and told my men to climb on board the ship and loose the cables  they did so  and sat down along the benches  the current bore the ship down river ocean  first with the help of oars  and then fair wind,27105,5134,-53.399999999999984,-1.7359839294410437,-1.0854947166186364,-1.45789023940545,-1.050001936602386,-58.14999999999998,-1.7832206162804558,-1.0603432367595496,-1.4871538755851894,-0.9586803782118196,-785.5755534783492,-1.5877719246765667,-1.0149079010745745,-1.1896352023191734,-0.9160382164281692,10.082231349206339,-0.6388599560027769,-0.76714934871834,-0.7800167495483756,-0.6204253088669734,161.6839999999996,0.6868799566529364,0.6680062326542779,-0.2063515722188607,-0.11484484251483981,145.57500299330871,-0.5145735361861797,-0.3435993267933215,-0.617793194443468,-0.34601698785681145,-23.475969362529874,-2.0046539205702096,-1.22028476353167,-1.5525682577898554,-0.8972213605201168,"{'neg':

Difficult choices  our ship sailed out beyond the stream of ocean, across the waves of open sea, and came to aeaea, home of newborn dawn, who dances in meadows with the beams of helius. we beached the ship upon the sandy shore, and disembarked, and there we fell asleep while waiting for bright morning. when dawn came, born early, with her fingertips like petals, i sent my men to circe s house, to bring the body of the dead elpenor. quickly

We chopped the wood and at the farthest headland we held a funeral for him, and wept profusely, crying out in grief. we burned his body and his gear, and built a mound, and dragged a pillar onto it, and fixed his oar on top each ritual step in turn. circe, the well-groomed goddess, was aware that we were back from hades, and she hurried to meet us with her slaves. they carried bread and meat and bright red wine. she stood among us,

And said,  this is amazing! you all went alive to hades you will be twice-dead, when other people only die one time! eat now, and stay here drinking wine all day. at dawn, sail on. i will explain your route in detail, so no evil thing can stitch a means to hurt you, on the land or sea.  i am a stubborn man, but i agreed, so there we sat and feasted on the meat and strong sweet wine until the sun went down.

When darkness fell, the men slept by the ship. then circe took my hand, and led me off apart from them, and questioned me in detail. i told her everything. the lady circe replied at last,  that quest is over now. so listen, i will give you good instructions; another god will make sure you remember. first you will reach the sirens, who bewitch all passersby. if anyone goes near them in ignorance, and listens to their voices,

That man will never travel to his home, and never make his wife and children happy to have him back with them again. the sirens who sit there in their meadow will seduce him with piercing songs. around about them lie great heaps of men, flesh rotting from their bones, their skin all shriveled up. use wax to plug your sailors  ears as you row past, so they are deaf to them. but if you wish to hear them, your men must fasten you to your ship s mast

By hand and foot, straight upright, with tight ropes. so bound, you can enjoy the sirens  song. but if you beg your men to set you free, they have to tie you down with firmer knots. i will not give you definite instructions about which route to take when you have sailed beyond the sirens. let your heart decide. there are two choices, and the first goes through vast overhanging rocks, which amphitrite batters aggressively with mighty waves.

The blessed gods call these the wandering rocks. no birds can fly through safe, not even doves, who bring ambrosia to zeus. one dove is always lost in that sheer gulf of stone and zeus must send another to restore the number of the flock. no human ship has ever passed there. when one tries to enter, the waves and raging gusts of fire engulf ship timbers and the bodies of the men. only the famous argo sailed through there

Returning from the visit with aeetes. the current hurled the ship towards the rocks, but hera, who loved jason, led them safe. taking the second way, you meet two rocks: one reaches up to heaven with its peak, surrounded by blue fog that never clears. no light comes through there, even in the summer. no man could climb it or set foot upon it, even if he had twenty hands and feet. the rock is sheer, as if it had been polished.

Right in the middle lies a murky cave that faces west, towards dark erebus. steer your ship past it, great odysseus. the hollow cave is so high up, no man could shoot it with an arrow. there lives scylla, howling and barking horribly; her voice is puppylike, but she is dangerous; even a god would be afraid of her. she has twelve dangling legs and six long necks with a gruesome head on each, and in each face

Three rows of crowded teeth, pregnant with death. her belly slumps inside the hollow cave; she keeps her heads above the yawning chasm and scopes around the rock, and hunts for fish. she catches dolphins, seals, and sometimes even enormous whales queen amphitrite, ruler of roaring waters, nurtures many creatures. no sailors ever pass that way unharmed. she snatches one man with each mouth from off each dark-prowed ship. the other rock is near,

Enough to shoot an arrow right across. this second rock is lower down, and on it there grows a fig tree with thick leaves. beneath, divine charybdis sucks black water down. three times a day she spurts it up; three times she glugs it down. avoid that place when she is swallowing the water. no one could save you from death then, even great poseidon. row fast, and steer your ship alongside scylla, since it is better if you lose six men

Than all of them.  i answered,  goddess, please, tell me the truth: is there no other way? or can i somehow circumvent charybdis and stop that scylla when she tries to kill my men?  the goddess answered,  no, you fool! your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war. but now you must surrender to the gods. she is not mortal. she is deathless evil, terrible, wild and cruel. you cannot fight her. the best solution and the only way

Is flight. i am afraid if you take time to arm beside the rock, she will attack again with all six heads and take six more. so row away with all your might, and call on scylla s mother, cratais, great force, who bore her as a blight on humankind. go fast, before the goddess strikes again. then you will reach the island called thrinacia, where helius keeps sheep and many cattle: fifty per herd, with seven herds in all.

They never reproduce or die, and those who tend them are the smooth-haired goddesses, phaethousa and lampetia, the shining daughters of helius by bright neaira. she brought them up, then sent them off to live there in remote thrinacia, to guard their father s sheep and cattle. if you can remember home and leave the cows unharmed, you will at last arrive in ithaca. but if you damage them, i must foretell

Disaster for your ship and for your crew. even if you survive, you will return late and humiliated, having caused the death of all your men.  the golden throne of dawn was riding up the sky as circe concluded, and she strode across her island. i went back to my ship and roused the men to get on board and loose the sternward cables. embarking, they sat down, each in his place, and struck the gray saltwater with their oars.

Behind our dark-prowed ship, the dreadful goddess circe sent friendly wind to fill the sails. we worked efficiently to organize the rigging, and the breeze and pilot steered. then with an anxious heart i told the crew,  my friends, the revelations circe shared with me should not be kept a secret, known to me alone. i will share them with you, and we can die in knowledge of the truth, or else escape. she said we must avoid

The voices of the otherworldly sirens; steer past their flowering meadow. and she says that i alone should hear their singing. bind me, to keep me upright at the mast, wound round with rope. if i beseech you and command you to set me free, you must increase my bonds and chain me even tighter.  so i told them each detail. soon our well-built ship, blown fast by fair winds, neared the island of the sirens, and suddenly, the wind died down. calm came.

Some spirit lulled the waves to sleep. the men got up, pulled down the sails, and stowed them in the hollow hold. they sat at oar and made the water whiten, struck by polished wood. i gripped a wheel of wax between my hands and cut it small. firm kneading and the sunlight warmed it, and then i rubbed it in the ears of each man in his turn. they bound my hands and feet, straight upright at the mast. they sat and hit the sea with oars. we traveled fast,

And when we were in earshot of the sirens, they knew our ship was near, and started singing.  odysseus! come here! you are well-known from many stories! glory of the greeks! now stop your ship and listen to our voices. all those who pass this way hear honeyed song, poured from our mouths. the music brings them joy, and they go on their way with greater knowledge, since we know everything the greeks and trojans suffered in troy, by gods  will; and we know

Whatever happens anywhere on earth.  their song was so melodious, i longed to listen more. i told my men to free me. i scowled at them, but they kept rowing on. eurylochus and perimedes stood and tied me even tighter, with more knots. but when we were well past them and i could no longer hear the singing of the sirens, i nodded to my men, and they removed the wax that i had used to plug their ears,

And untied me. when we had left that island, i saw a mighty wave and smoke, and heard a roar. the men were terrified; their hands let fall the oars they splashed down in the water. the ship stayed still, since no one now was pulling the slender blades. i strode along the deck pausing to cheer each man, then gave a speech to rally all of them.  dear friends! we are experienced in danger. this is not worse than the time the cyclops captured us,

And forced us to remain inside his cave. we got away that time, thanks to my skill and brains and strategy. remember that. come on then, all of you, and trust my words. sit on your benches, strike the swelling deep with oars, since zeus may grant us a way out from this disaster also. pilot, listen: these are your orders. as you hold the rudder, direct the ship away from that dark smoke and rising wave, and head towards the rock;

If the ship veers the other way, you will endanger us.  they promptly followed orders. i did not mention scylla, since she meant inevitable death, and if they knew, the men would drop the oars and go and huddle down in the hold in fear. then i ignored circe s advice that i should not bear arms; it was too hard for me. i dressed myself in glorious armor; in my hands i took two long spears, and i climbed up on the forecastle.

I thought that rocky scylla would appear from that direction, to destroy my men. so we rowed through the narrow strait in tears. on one side, scylla; on the other, shining charybdis with a dreadful gurgling noise sucked down the water. when she spewed it out, she seethed, all churning like a boiling cauldron on a huge fire. the froth flew high, to spatter the topmost rocks on either side. but when she swallowed back the sea, she seemed all stirred

From inside, and the rock around was roaring dreadfully, and the dark-blue sand below was visible. the men were seized by fear. but while our frightened gaze was on charybdis, scylla snatched six men from the ship my strongest, best fighters. looking back from down below, i saw their feet and hands up high, as they were carried off. in agony they cried to me and called my name their final words. as when a fisherman out on a cliff

Casts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn to trick the little fishes with his bait; when one is caught, he flings it gasping back onto the shore so those men gasped as scylla lifted them up high to her rocky cave and at the entrance ate them up still screaming, still reaching out to me in their death throes. that was the most heartrending sight i saw in all the time i suffered on the sea. free from the rocks of scylla and charybdis

We quickly reached the island of the god, hyperion s son helius, the sun god. there were his cattle, with their fine broad faces, and many flocks of well-fed sheep. while still out on the sea in my black ship, i heard the lowing of the cattle in their pens, and bleating of the sheep. i kept in mind the words of blind tiresias the prophet and circe. both had given strict instructions that we avoid the island of the sun,

The god of human joy. i told the men with heavy heart,  my friends, i know how much you have endured. but listen to me now. tiresias and circe both insisted we must avoid the island of the sun, the joy of mortals. they said dreadful danger lurks there for us. we have to steer our ship around it.  they were quite downcast by this. eurylochus said angrily to me,  you are unfair to us, odysseus.

You may be strong; you never seem to tire; you must be made of iron. but we men have had no rest or sleep; we are exhausted. and you refuse to let us disembark and cook our tasty dinner on this island. you order us to drift around all night in our swift ship across the misty sea. at night, fierce storms rise up and wreck men s ships, and how can anyone escape disaster if sudden gusts of wind from north or west

Bring cruel blasts to break the ship, despite the wishes of the gods? let us submit to evening. let us stay here, and cook food beside the ship. at dawn we can embark and sail the open sea.  that was his speech. the other men agreed, and then i saw a spirit must be plotting our destruction. my words flew out.  eurylochus! you force me to yield, since i am one and you are many. but all of you, swear me a mighty oath:

If we find any herd of cows, or flock of sheep, do not be fool enough to kill a single animal. stay clear, and eat the food provided by immortal circe.  they swore as i commanded. when they finished making the oath, we set our well-built ship inside the curving harbor, near freshwater. the men got out and skillfully cooked dinner. when they were satisfied with food and drink, they wept, remembering their dear companions,

Whom scylla captured from the ship and ate. sweet sleep came down upon them as they cried. when night was over, when the stars were gone, zeus roused a blast of wind, an eerie storm. he covered earth and sea with fog, and darkness fell down from heaven. when rose-fingered dawn appeared, we dragged the ship inside a cave, a place nymphs danced in, and we moored it there. i gave a speech to my assembled men.  my friends, we have supplies on board. let us

Not touch the cattle, or we will regret it. those cows and fat sheep are the property of helius, the great sun god, who sees all things, and hears all things.  i told them this. reluctantly they yielded. but that month the south wind blew and never stopped. no other was ever blowing, only south and east. while the men still had food and wine, they kept clear of the cows. they hoped to save their lives. but when our ship s supplies ran out, the men

Were forced to hunt; they used their hooks to catch both fish and birds, whatever they could get, since hunger gnawed their bellies. i strode off to pray, in case some god would show me how to get back home. i left my men behind, and crossed the island, washed my hands, in shelter out of the wind, and prayed to all the gods. they poured sweet sleep upon my eyes. meanwhile, eurylochus proposed a foolish plan.  listen, my friends! you have already suffered

Too much. all human deaths are hard to bear. but starving is most miserable of all. so let us poach the finest of these cattle, and sacrifice them to the deathless gods. if we get home to ithaca, at once we will construct a temple to the sun god, with treasure in it. if he is so angry about these cows that he decides to wreck our ship, and if the other gods agree  i would prefer to drink the sea and die

At once, than perish slowly, shriveled up here on this desert island.  all the others agreed with him. they went to poach the best of helius  cattle, which were grazing beside the ship. the men surrounded them, and called upon the gods. they had plucked leaves from oak trees on the ship there was no barley. they prayed, then killed them, skinned them, and cut off the thighs, and covered up the bones with fat, a double layer, with raw meat on top.

They had no wine to pour libations over the burning offering, but they made do with water, and they roasted all the innards. and when the thighs were burned, the entrails sprinkled, they cut the other meat up into chunks for skewers. sweet sleep melted from my eyes; i rushed back to the ship beside the shore. when i was close, the meaty smell of cooking enfolded me. i groaned, and told the gods,  o zeus, and all you deathless gods! you blinded

My mind with that infernal sleep. my men did dreadful things while i was gone.  meanwhile, lampetia in flowing skirts ran off to tell the sun god we had killed his cows. enraged, he called the other gods.  great zeus, and all you other deathless gods, you must punish odysseus  men. they killed my cattle! i delighted in those cows all through each day, when i went up to heaven and when i turned to earth. if they do not

Repay me, i will sink down into hades and bring my bright light only to the dead.  zeus answered,  helius! please shine with us and shine for mortals on life-giving earth. i will immediately smite their ship with my bright thunderbolt, and smash it up in fragments, all across the wine-dark sea.  i heard this from the beautiful calypso, who had been told by hermes. back on shore beside my ship, i scolded each of them.

It did no good; the cows were dead already. the gods sent signs the hides began to twitch, the meat on skewers started mooing, raw and cooked. there was the sound of cattle lowing. for six days my men banqueted on beef from helius. when zeus, the son of cronus, led in the seventh day, the wind became less stormy, and we quickly went on board. we set the mast up and unfurled the sails and set out on the open sea. when we

Had left that island, we could see no other, only the sky and sea. zeus made a mass of dark-blue storm cloud hang above our ship. the sea grew dark beneath it. for a moment the ship moved on, but then came zephyr, shrieking, noisily rushing, with torrential tempest. a mighty gust of wind broke off both forestays; the tacking was all scattered in the hold. the mast was broken backwards, and it struck the pilot in the stern; it smashed his skull.

His bones were crushed, his skeleton was smashed. he fell down like a diver from the deck; his spirit left his body. at that instant, zeus thundered and hurled bolts to strike the ship; shaken, it filled with sulfur. all the men fell overboard, and they were swept away like seagulls on the waves beside the ship. the gods prevented them from reaching home. i paced on board until the current ripped the ship s side from the keel. the waves bore off

The husk, and snapped the mast. but thrown across it there was a backstay cable, oxhide leather. with this i lashed the keel and mast together, and rode them, carried on by fearsome winds. at last the tempest ceased, the west wind lulled. i worried that the south wind might compel me to backtrack, to the terrible charybdis. all night i was swept backwards and at sunrise i came back to the dreadful rocks of scylla and of charybdis, gulping salty water,

And overshadowed by the fig tree s branches. i jumped and clutched its trunk, batlike unable to plant my feet, or climb. the roots were down too low; the tall long branches were too high. so i kept clinging on; i hoped charybdis would belch my mast and keel back up. she did! as one who spends the whole day judging quarrels between young men, at last goes home to eat  at that same hour, the planks came bobbing up out of charybdis. i let go my hands

And feet and dropped myself way down to splash into the sea below, beside the timbers of floating wood. i clambered onto them, and used my hands to row myself away, and zeus ensured that scylla did not see me, or else i could not have survived. i drifted for nine days. on the evening of the tenth, the gods helped me to reach the island of the dreadful, beautiful, divine calypso. she loved and cared for me. why should i tell

The story that i told you and your wife yesterday in your house? it is annoying, repeating tales that have been told before.",difficult choices  our ship sailed out beyond the stream of ocean  across the waves of open sea  and came to aeaea  home of newborn dawn  who dances in meadows with the beams of helius  we beached the ship upon the sandy shore  and disembarked  and there we fell asleep while waiting for bright morning  when dawn came  born early  with her fingertips like petals  i sent my men to circe s house  to bring the body of the dead elpenor  quickly  we chopped the wood and at the farthest headland we held a funeral for him  and wept profusely  crying out in grief  we burned his body and his gear  and built a mound  and dragged a pillar onto it  and fixed his oar on top each ritual step in turn  circe  the well groomed goddess  was aware that we were back from hades  and she hurried to meet us with her slaves  they carried bread and meat and bright red wine  she stood among us   and said   this is amazing  you all went alive to hades you will be twice dead  when other people only die one time  eat now  and stay here drinking wine all day  at dawn  sail on  i will explain your route in detail  so no evil thing can stitch a means to hurt you  on the land or sea   i am a stubborn man  but i agreed  so there we sat and feasted on the meat and strong sweet wine until the sun went down   when darkness fell  the men slept by the ship  then circe took my hand  and led me off apart from them  and questioned me in detail  i told her everything  the lady circe replied at last   that quest is over now  so listen  i will give you good instructions  another god will make sure you remember  first you will reach the sirens  who bewitch all passersby  if anyone goes near them in ignorance  and listens to their voices   that man will never travel to his home  and never make his wife and children happy to have him back with them again  the sirens who sit there in their meadow will seduce him with piercing songs  around about them lie great heaps of men  flesh rotting from their bones  their skin all shriveled up  use wax to plug your sailors  ears as you row past  so they are deaf to them  but if you wish to hear them  your men must fasten you to your ship s mast  by hand and foot  straight upright  with tight ropes  so bound  you can enjoy the sirens  song  but if you beg your men to set you free  they have to tie you down with firmer knots  i will not give you definite instructions about which route to take when you have sailed beyond the sirens  let your heart decide  there are two choices  and the first goes through vast overhanging rocks  which amphitrite batters aggressively with mighty waves   the blessed gods call these the wandering rocks  no birds can fly through safe  not even doves  who bring ambrosia to zeus  one dove is always lost in that sheer gulf of stone and zeus must send another to restore the number of the flock  no human ship has ever passed there  when one tries to enter  the waves and raging gusts of fire engulf ship timbers and the bodies of the men  only the famous argo sailed through there  returning from the visit with aeetes  the current hurled the ship towards the rocks  but hera  who loved jason  led them safe  taking the second way  you meet two rocks  one reaches up to heaven with its peak  surrounded by blue fog that never clears  no light comes through there  even in the summer  no man could climb it or set foot upon it  even if he had twenty hands and feet  the rock is sheer  as if it had been polished   right in the middle lies a murky cave that faces west  towards dark erebus  steer your ship past it  great odysseus  the hollow cave is so high up  no man could shoot it with an arrow  there lives scylla  howling and barking horribly  her voice is puppylike  but she is dangerous  even a god would be afraid of her  she has twelve dangling legs and six long necks with a gruesome head on each  and in each face  three rows of crowded teeth  pregnant with death  her belly slumps inside the hollow cave  she keeps her heads above the yawning chasm and scopes around the rock  and hunts for fish  she catches dolphins  seals  and sometimes even enormous whales queen amphitrite  ruler of roaring waters  nurtures many creatures  no sailors ever pass that way unharmed  she snatches one man with each mouth from off each dark prowed ship  the other rock is near   enough to shoot an arrow right across  this second rock is lower down  and on it there grows a fig tree with thick leaves  beneath  divine charybdis sucks black water down  three times a day she spurts it up  three times she glugs it down  avoid that place when she is swallowing the water  no one could save you from death then  even great poseidon  row fast  and steer your ship alongside scylla  since it is better if you lose six men  than all of them   i answered   goddess  please  tell me the truth  is there no other way  or can i somehow circumvent charybdis and stop that scylla when she tries to kill my men   the goddess answered   no  you fool  your mind is still obsessed with deeds of war  but now you must surrender to the gods  she is not mortal  she is deathless evil  terrible  wild and cruel  you cannot fight her  the best solution and the only way  is flight  i am afraid if you take time to arm beside the rock  she will attack again with all six heads and take six more  so row away with all your might  and call on scylla s mother  cratais  great force  who bore her as a blight on humankind  go fast  before the goddess strikes again  then you will reach the island called thrinacia  where helius keeps sheep and many cattle  fifty per herd  with seven herds in all   they never reproduce or die  and those who tend them are the smooth haired goddesses  phaethousa and lampetia  the shining daughters of helius by bright neaira  she brought them up  then sent them off to live there in remote thrinacia  to guard their father s sheep and cattle  if you can remember home and leave the cows unharmed  you will at last arrive in ithaca  but if you damage them  i must foretell  disaster for your ship and for your crew  even if you survive  you will return late and humiliated  having caused the death of all your men   the golden throne of dawn was riding up the sky as circe concluded  and she strode across her island  i went back to my ship and roused the men to get on board and loose the sternward cables  embarking  they sat down  each in his place  and struck the gray saltwater with their oars   behind our dark prowed ship  the dreadful goddess circe sent friendly wind to fill the sails  we worked efficiently to organize the rigging  and the breeze and

 all those who pass this way hear honeyed song  poured from our mouths  the music brings them joy  and they go on their way with greater knowledge  since we know everything the greeks and trojans suffered in troy  by gods  will  and we know  whatever happens anywhere on earth   their song was so melodious  i longed to listen more  i told my men to free me  i scowled at them  but they kept rowing on  eurylochus and perimedes stood and tied me even tighter  with more knots  but when we were well past them and i could no longer hear the singing of the sirens  i nodded to my men  and they

 these are your orders  as you hold the rudder  direct the ship away from that dark smoke and rising wave  and head towards the rock   if the ship veers the other way  you will endanger us   they promptly followed orders  i did not mention scylla  since she meant inevitable death  and if they knew  the men would drop the oars and go and huddle down in the hold in fear  then i ignored circe s advice that i should not bear arms  it was too hard for me  i dressed myself in glorious armor  in my hands i took two long spears  and i climbed up on the forecastle   i thought that rocky scylla would appear from that direction  to destroy my men  so we rowed through the narrow strait in tears  on one side  scylla  on the other  shining charybdis with a dreadful gurgling noise sucked down the water  when she spewed it out  she seethed  all churning like a boiling cauldron on a huge fire  the froth flew high  to spatter the topmost rocks on either side  but when she swallowed back the sea  she seemed all stirred  from inside  and the rock around was roaring dreadfully  and the dark blue sand below was visible  the men were seized by fear  but while our frightened gaze was on charybdis  scylla snatched six men from the ship my strongest  best fighters  looking back from down below  i saw their feet and hands up high  as they were carried off  in agony they cried to me and called my name their final words  as when a fisherman out on a cliff  casts his long rod and line set round with oxhorn to trick the little fishes with his bait  when one is caught  he flings it gasping back onto the shore so those men gasped as scylla lifted them up high to her rocky cave and at the entrance ate them up still screaming  still reaching out to me in their death throes  that was the most heartrending sight i saw in all the time i suffered on the sea  free from the rocks of scylla and charybdis  we quickly reached the island of the god  hyperion s son helius  the sun god  there were his cattle  with their fine broad faces  and many flocks of well fed sheep  while still out on the sea in my black ship  i heard the lowing of the cattle in their pens  and bleating of the sheep  i kept in mind the words of blind tiresias the prophet and circe  both had given strict instructions that we avoid the island of the sun   the god of human joy  i told the men with heavy heart   my friends  i know how much you have endured  but listen to me now  tiresias and circe both insisted we must avoid the island of the sun  the joy of mortals  they said dreadful danger lurks there for us  we have to steer our ship around it   they were quite downcast by this  eurylochus said angrily to me   you are unfair to us  odysseus   you may be strong  you never seem to tire  you must be made of

across the misty sea  at night  fierce storms rise up and wreck men s ships  and how can anyone escape disaster if sudden gusts of wind from north or west  bring cruel blasts to break the ship  despite the wishes of the gods  let us submit to evening  let us stay here  and cook food beside the ship  at dawn we can embark and sail the open sea   that was his speech  the other men agreed  and then i saw a spirit must be plotting our destruction  my words flew out   eurylochus  you force me to yield  since i am one and you are many  but all of you  swear me a mighty oath   if we find any herd of cows  or flock of sheep  do not be fool enough to kill a single animal  stay clear  and eat the food provided by immortal circe   they swore as i commanded  when they finished making the oath  we set our well built ship inside the curving harbor  near freshwater  the men got out and skillfully cooked dinner  when they were satisfied with food and drink  they wept  remembering their dear

all things  and hears all things   i told them this  reluctantly they yielded  but that month the south wind blew and never stopped  no other was ever blowing  only south and east  while the men still

killed my cattle  i delighted in those cows all through each day  when i went up to heaven and when i turned to earth  if they do not  repay me  i will sink down into hades and bring my bright light only to the dead   zeus answered   helius  please shine with us and shine for mortals on life giving earth  i will immediately smite their ship with my bright thunderbolt  and smash it up in fragments  all across the wine dark sea   i heard this from the beautiful calypso  who had been told by hermes  back on shore beside my ship  i scolded each of them   it did no good  the cows were dead already  the gods sent signs the hides began to twitch  the meat on skewers started mooing  raw and cooked  there was the sound of cattle lowing  for six days my men banqueted on beef from helius  when zeus

paced on board until the current ripped the ship s side from the keel  the waves bore off  the husk  and snapped the mast  but thrown across it there was a backstay cable  oxhide leather  with this i lashed the keel and mast together  and rode them  carried on by fearsome winds  at last the tempest ceased  the west wind lulled  i worried that the south wind might compel me to backtrack  to the terrible charybdis  all night i was swept backwards and at sunrise i came back to the dreadful rocks of scylla and of charybdis  gulping salty water   and overshadowed by the fig tree s branches  i jumped and clutched its trunk  batlike unable to plant my feet  or climb  the roots were down too low  the tall long branches were too high  so i kept clinging on  i hoped charybdis would belch my mast and keel back up  she did  as one who spends the whole day judging quarrels between young men  at last goes home to eat  at that same hour  the planks came bobbing up out of charybdis  i let go my hands  and feet and dropped myself way down to splash into the sea below  beside the timbers of floating wood  i clambered onto them  and used my hands to row myself away  and zeus ensured that

Two tricksters after he finished, all were silent, spellbound, sitting inside the shadowy hall. at last, alcinous said,  now, odysseus, since you have been my guest, beneath my roof, you need not wander anymore. you have endured enough; you will get home again. and all you regulars, my honored friends who always drink red wine here in my house and listen to my singer: heed my words. our guest has clothes packed up inside a trunk,

And other gifts that we have given him. each of us now should add a mighty tripod and cauldron. i will make the people pay a levy, so that none of us will suffer from unrewarded generosity.  the king s words pleased them all. they went back home to rest. then dawn was born again; her fingers bloomed, and they hurried back towards the ship bringing heroic gifts of bronze. the king embarked and stowed them underneath the beams,

To leave room for the crew when they were rowing. then all the men went back with him to eat. the holy king killed sacrificial meat  a cow to zeus of dark clouds, son of cronus, who rules the world. they burned the thighs and feasted in happiness. the well-respected singer demodocus made music in their midst. but all the while odysseus kept turning his head towards the shining sun, impatient for it to set. he longed to leave. as when

A man is desperate for dinnertime after he spends the whole day with his oxen dragging the jointed plow across the field, and welcomes sunset, when he can go home to eat; his legs are aching on the way  just so odysseus was glad of sunset. at once he told the seafaring phaeacians, especially alcinous,  great king, and all of you, please send me safely home with offerings, and thank you. i am grateful

To you for giving me my heart s desire: a passage home, with gifts. i hope the gods maintain my luck. when i am home, i pray to find my wife still faultless, and my loved ones safe. and may you phaeacians live to bring joy to your wives and children every blessing. i pray there is no trouble for your people.  they praised his words and said that they must help their guest go home, since he had spoken well. alcinous addressed his right-hand man.

 pontonous, now mix a bowl of wine; serve drinks to everybody in the hall, so we may pray to zeus and help our guest back to his homeland.  so the steward mixed a cheering bowl of wine and served them all in turn. still in their seats, they poured libations to all the blessed gods that live in heaven. godlike odysseus stood up and put a double-handled cup into the hands of arete. his words flew out to her.

 bless you forever, queen, until old age and death arrive for you, as for us all. i will leave now. be happy in your home and children, and your people, and your king.  with that, the noble hero crossed the threshold. alcinous sent out his steward with him to guide him to the swift ship on the shore. arete sent some slave girls too. one brought a freshly laundered cloak and tunic; one carried the well-carved chest; the third brought bread

And red wine. when they reached the ship, the guides took all the food and drink and packed it neatly inside the hold. they spread a sheet and blanket out on the stern-deck of the hollow ship so he could sleep there soundly. climbing on, he lay there quietly. the rowers sat down on the benches calmly, and then loosed the cable from the mooring stone. they pulled, leaning back hard; the oar blades splashed the water. a sound sweet sleep fell on his eyes, like death;

He did not stir. as four fine stallions rush at the whip and race their chariot across the track, heads high, an easy canter  so was the ship s prow raised. the seething waves of sounding purple sea rushed round the stern as she sped straight ahead. the swiftest bird, a hawk, could never overtake; she sailed so fast, and cleaved the waves. she bore a man whose mind was like the gods , who had endured many heartbreaking losses, and the pain

Of war and shipwreck. now he slept in peace, and he remembered nothing of his pain. but when the brightest star that carries news about the coming dawn rose up the sky, the seaborne ship neared land. there is a harbor of phorcys, ancient sea god, in the district of ithaca. on either side of it there are sheer cliffs that jut across the bay; they shelter it and keep big waves outside when storm winds blow. the ships remain in harbor

Without a tether, once they cross its bounds. at the bay s head there grows a long-leafed olive, and near it is a beautiful dark cave, a holy place of sea-nymphs nereids. inside are bowls and amphorae of stone, and buzzing bees bring honey. there are looms, also of stone; the nymphs weave purple cloth, sea-purple it is marvelous to see. water is always flowing through. there are two entrances. the north one is for humans;

The south is sacred. people cannot enter that way it is the path of the immortals. they rowed inside the bay; they knew the place of old. their arms were pulling at top speed; the ship was traveling so fast that when she reached dry land, she beached for half her length. they disembarked, and lifted from the ship odysseus, wrapped up in sheets and blankets. they set him on the sand, still fast asleep. they unpacked all the presents he was given

By the phaeacian lords to take back home, thanks to athena s care. they heaped the things beside the olive tree, so no one passing would do them any damage while their owner was sleeping. then they rowed away, back home. poseidon, lord of earthquakes, still remembered his hatred of odysseus; he asked zeus what he meant to do.  o father zeus! i will lose all my standing with the gods, since mortals fail to honor me, though these

Phaeacians are my very own descendants! i always said odysseus would reach home in the end. i did not take away that privilege from him, no, not at all, since you had promised it with your own nod. their swift ship carried him across the ocean, and they have set him down in ithaca with a magnificent array of gifts: bronze, heaps of gold and fine-spun clothes, far more spoils than he ever would have won at troy

If he had got out safely.  storm god zeus exclaimed,  earth-shaker! how absurd! the gods do not dishonor you; it would be hard to disrespect an elder so high-ranking. if willful humans fail to show respect, then punish them; you always have that power. do as you wish!  poseidon answered,  lord of dark clouds, i have always wanted to. i held back out of deference to you. but now, when that fine ship of those phaeacians

Comes back from helping him across, i want to smash it in the sea, and overwhelm their city with a mountain, to prevent them from ever guiding travelers again.  the cloud lord zeus said,  brother, i suggest that while the people in the city watch, you turn the ship arriving into stone, still looking like a ship. they will all be shocked. then you can surround their town with a huge mountain.  hearing this, poseidon

Went to phaeacian scheria, and waited. as the ship sped towards the shore, the god moved near it, turned it all to stone, and slapped his palm to make it rooted to the seabed. he vanished, and the people of phaeacia, known for their oars and famous ships, began to ask each other,  what? who fixed that ship firm in the sea as she was rushing home? we saw it all!  they could not understand it. alcinous addressed the crowd and spoke.

 so it is true! my father long ago said that poseidon hates us for our habit of helping travelers get home again; we got away with it, but he foretold that one day great poseidon would destroy a ship on her return from such a journey; the god would hide our city with a mountain. and now the old man s words are coming true. so all of you must listen to me now. stop helping visitors to travel onward.

We have to sacrifice twelve bulls, handpicked for lord poseidon, so he may show mercy, and not enfold our city in a mountain.  at this, they were afraid, and they prepared the bulls, and all the leaders of phaeacia prayed to poseidon, standing round the altar. meanwhile odysseus, who had been sleeping in his own native land of ithaca woke up, but did not recognize the place from which he had been absent for so long.

Pallas athena cast a mist upon it, so she could tell him how things stood, and make him unrecognizable to his own wife and family and neighbors, till he paid the suitors back for how they misbehaved. the friendly harbors and the winding paths and leafy trees were all quite unfamiliar to their own king. he leapt up to his feet and looking at his native land, he groaned and smacked his thighs, and sobbed,  where am i now?

Are those who live here violent and cruel? or are they kind to strangers, folks who fear the gods? where can i carry all my treasure? and where can i go wandering? if only i had remained there in phaeacia, till i went on to some other mighty king who might have been my friend and helped me home. where can i leave my things? not here for sure; they will be stolen. those phaeacian lords were not so trustworthy! they promised me

That they would bring me home to ithaca. they broke their word and brought me somewhere else. may zeus who helps the needy make them pay! zeus watches everyone, and punishes the sinner. let me count my treasure now  they may have stolen some when they sailed off.  he counted all the tripods, cauldrons, gold and cloth, but none was missing. then he paced beside the loud resounding sea, hunched up with homesickness and sobbing in his grief.

Athena came towards him; she looked like a shepherd, young and soft-skinned as a prince, wearing a folded mantle of fine cloth across her shoulders; on her tender feet were sandals, and she held a javelin. odysseus was overjoyed to see her. he cried,  oh, friend! you are the very first person that i have met here. greetings! please, be kind, protect my treasure and myself. i pray to you and supplicate, as if

You were a god. i touch your knees; please help me! and tell me, please, what is this place? an island? or is it a peninsula that slopes towards the sea from fertile mainland fields? who lives here?  and with twinkling eyes the goddess said,  stranger, you must be a foreigner from distant parts, or foolish, since you ask about this famous country. many people know it, from those who live towards the east under the rising sun, to those out west

In lands of gloomy dusk. this is rough country, not fit for grazing horses, and not spacious, but not infertile; corn and wine abound here. the land is always wet with rain and dew. there are fine water holes, and it is good for raising goats and cattle, and the trees are varied. foreigner, i think the name of ithaca is even known in troy, a land they say is far away from greece.  odysseus, who had endured so much,

So long, was overjoyed, to hear from her that he was in his own dear native land. his words took wings and flew, but he did not tell her the truth; he bit his story back. his mind was always full of clever schemes.  yes, i have heard of ithaca, although i come from distant crete. now i am here with all this wealth; i left an equal share of riches for my children back at home. i am in exile. on the fields of crete

I killed orsilochus, the speedy sprinter, the son of idomeneus, the king. i had refused to serve or help his father at troy; i led my own men. so the son wanted to steal the trojan spoils for which i worked so hard, in war and long sea journeys. i hid beside the road with one companion, and as he came back from the countryside, i ambushed him, and hit him with my spear. the sky was dark that night, and no one saw me

Kill him with my sharp sword of bronze. and after i murdered him, i quickly rowed away to visit the phoenicians, and i gave them a share of loot, which made them very glad. i told them they should transport me to pylos, or famous elis, ruled by the epeians. but storm winds drove them off away from there against their will: they did not mean to trick me. so swept off course, we came here in the night. we rowed at top speed into harbor, hungry,

But none of us took any thought of dinner. we disembarked and all lay down right there. sweet sleep enfolded me. i was exhausted. they took my treasure from the ship and set it beside me as i slept upon the sand. and then they sailed away to well-built sidon, and i was left here grieving.  at his words, athena smiled into his eyes. she took his hand, and changed her body to a woman s: beautiful, tall, and skilled in all the arts.

Her words were light as feathers.  to outwit you in all your tricks, a person or a god would need to be an expert at deceit. you clever rascal! so duplicitous, so talented at lying! you love fiction and tricks so deeply, you refuse to stop even in your own land. yes, both of us are smart. no man can plan and talk like you, and i am known among the gods for insight and craftiness. you failed to recognize me:

I am athena, child of zeus. i always stand near you and take care of you, in all your hardships. i made sure that you were welcomed by the phaeacians. i have come here now to weave a plan with you and hide the treasure which, thanks to me, they gave you to take home. i will reveal the challenges you face at home. this is your fate, and you must bear it bravely, not telling any man or woman that you have finished wandering and come back.

Suffer in silence, bear their brutal treatment.  odysseus, still wary, answered,  goddess, even the smartest man may find it hard to recognize you. you disguise yourself so many ways. i do know that you helped me during the trojan war, so long ago. but when we greeks had sacked the town of priam, and we embarked, and gods dispersed our fleet, i did not see you there on board my ship, daughter of zeus. you gave me no protection.

Lost and confused, i waited for the gods to free me from my pain. i met you later, in rich phaeacia, and you spoke to me comforting words, and led me to the city. please, by your father zeus! i cannot think that this is ithaca. i must be elsewhere. you want to fool me and make fun of me. tell me the truth! is this my own dear home?  with glowing eyes she said,  you always have such keen intelligence, and that is why

I cannot leave you when you need my help. you have such intuition and such focus. an ordinary man would rush straight home to see his wife and children when he reached his country, after such a journey. you decided not to even ask about them, until you test your wife. she sits at home, passing each night in misery, each day in tears. for my part, i have never doubted. i felt sure in my heart you would get home,

After the loss of all your men. but i did not want conflict with my father s brother, poseidon, who resented you because you blinded his beloved son. now i will show you ithaca, so you believe. this is the bay of phorcys, ancient sea god, and at the head there is an olive tree with long leaves, and nearby, the shady cave sacred to nymphs called nereids, to whom you sacrificed so many hundred cattle.

And here is neriton, the wooded mountain.  with that, the goddess made the mist disperse. the land was visible. odysseus, after so long a wait and so much pain, was filled with happiness at last. in joy he kissed the fertile earth of his own country, then lifted high his arms and prayed,  o nymphs! i never thought i would come back to you, daughters of zeus. accept my loving prayers, and i will give you gifts, as in the past,

If my commander, child of zeus, is kind and lets me live and raise my son.  athena looked straight into his eyes and said,  be brave. you need not worry. let us hurry now to hide the treasure safely in the cave. and then we must make plans.  the goddess went down in the murky cave, and looked around for hiding spots. odysseus brought in the presents the phaeacians gave him gold, and tireless bronze and finely woven cloth.

Athena set them all inside, and fixed the door-stone up, and then the two sat down against the sacred olive and they planned how to destroy the suitors. eyes aglow, athena said,  great king, laertes  son, master of plots and plans, odysseus, think how to strike the suitors. for three years they have been lording in your house and courting your godlike wife with gifts. she always longs for your return, and grieves. she leads them on

With promises and messages to each, but her mind moves elsewhere.  odysseus cried,  oh! i would have died like agamemnon in my own house, if you had not explained exactly how things stand. so, goddess, now weave me a strategy to pay them back. stand by me, give me courage and the drive to fight as when i broke the shining crown of troy. if you will join me with that zeal and help me, goddess-queen, i could do battle

Against three hundred men at once.  athena looked straight at him, clear-eyed. she said,  i will be with you, truly. know i stand beside you as we begin our work. i do believe the suitors who devour your livelihood will spatter your broad floors with blood and brains. but now i will disguise you, so no human can recognize you. i will shrivel up the fine skin of your supple arms and legs, ruin your hair, and dress you up in rags,

So everyone will shudder, seeing you. and i will cloud your eyes, to make you seem ugly to all the suitors, and your wife and to the son you left at home. now visit the swineherd who, though he is just a slave, adores your son and wise penelope and is your friend. go look for him among the sows who root beside the corax rock and near the spring of arethusa, drinking black water, eating good nutritious acorns,

Which fatten pigs. stay there and sit with him, and ask him everything. and i will go to sparta, where the girls are beautiful, to fetch telemachus, the boy you love. he went to menelaus, to find out if you are still alive.  he asked her sharply,  but why did you not tell him? you must know everything. did you want him suffering like me, lost out at sea, while others eat his whole inheritance?  with shining eyes

Athena answered,  come now, do not worry about the boy. i guided him myself so that he might win glory by his journey. he is not suffering. he is away, sitting and banqueting with menelaus. the suitors do indeed desire to kill him, and wait in ambush for him in their ship. but they will not succeed, i think. the earth will cover one or more of those who eat your property.  then with her wand athena

Tapped him; his handsome body withered up; his limbs became arthritic. she bleached out his hair, and made his skin look old and wrinkled, and dimmed his fine bright eyes. she turned his clothes into a tattered cloak and ragged tunic, dirty with soot. she wrapped around his shoulders a massive leather deerskin, and she gave him a threadbare tote bag and a walking stick. their plans were set; they parted. she went off to sparta, to go fetch telemachus.",two tricksters after he finished  all were silent  spellbound  sitting inside the shadowy hall  at last  alcinous said   now  odysseus  since

you and supplicate  as if  you were a god  i touch your knees  please help me  and tell me  please  what is this place  an island  or is it a peninsula that slopes towards the sea from fertile mainland fields  who lives here   and with twinkling eyes the goddess said   stranger  you must be a foreigner from distant parts  or foolish  since you ask about this famous country  many people know it  from those who live towards the east under the rising sun  to those out west  in lands of gloomy dusk  this is rough country  not fit for grazing horses  and not spacious  but not infertile  corn and wine abound here  the land is always wet with rain and dew  there are fine water holes  and it is good for raising goats and cattle  and the trees are varied  foreigner  i think the name of ithaca is even known in troy  a land they say is far away from greece   odysseus  who had endured so much   so long  was overjoyed  to hear from her that he was in his own dear native land  his words took wings and flew  but he did not tell her the truth  he bit his story back  his mind was always full of clever schemes   yes  i have heard of ithaca  although i come from distant crete  now i am here with all this wealth  i left an equal share of riches for my children back at home  i am in exile  on the fields of crete  i killed orsilochus  the speedy sprinter  the son of idomeneus  the king  i had refused to serve or help his father at troy  i led my own men  so the son wanted to steal the trojan spoils for which i worked so hard  in war and long sea journeys  i hid beside the road with one companion  and as he came back from the countryside  i ambushed him  and hit him with my spear  the sky was dark that night  and no one saw me  kill him with my sharp sword of bronze  and after i murdered him  i quickly rowed away to visit the phoenicians  and i gave them a share of loot  which made them very glad  i told them they should transport me to pylos  or famous elis  ruled by the epeians  but storm winds drove them off away from there against their will  they did not mean to trick me  so swept off course  we came here in the night  we rowed at top speed into harbor  hungry   but none of us took any thought of dinner  we disembarked and all lay down right there  sweet sleep enfolded me  i was exhausted  they took my treasure from the ship and set it beside me as i slept upon the sand  and then they sailed away to well built sidon  and i was left here grieving   at his words  athena smiled into his eyes  she took his hand  and changed her body to a woman s  beautiful  tall  and skilled in all the arts   her words were light as feathers   to outwit you in all your tricks  a person or a god would need to be an expert at deceit  you clever rascal  so duplicitous  so talented at lying  you love fiction and tricks so deeply  you refuse to stop even in your own land  yes  both of us are smart  no man can plan and talk like you  and i am known among the gods for insight and craftiness  you failed to recognize me   i am athena  child of zeus  i always stand near you and take care of you  in all your hardships  i made sure that you were welcomed by the phaeacians  i have come here now to weave a plan with you and hide the treasure which  thanks to me  they gave you to take home  i will reveal the challenges you face at home  this is your fate  and you must bear it bravely  not telling any man or woman that you have finished wandering and come back   suffer in silence  bear their brutal treatment   odysseus  still wary  answered   goddess  even the smartest man may find it hard to recognize you  you disguise yourself so many ways  i do know that you helped me during the trojan war  so long ago  but when we greeks had sacked the town of priam  and we embarked  and gods dispersed our fleet  i did not see you there on board my ship  daughter of zeus  you gave me no protection   lost and confused  i waited for the gods to free me from my pain  i met you later  in rich phaeacia  and you spoke to me comforting words  and led me to the city  please  by your father zeus  i cannot think that this is ithaca  i must be elsewhere  you want to fool me and make fun of me  tell me the truth  is this my own dear home   with glowing eyes she said   you always have such keen intelligence  and that is why  i cannot leave you when you need my help  you have such intuition and such focus  an ordinary man would rush straight home to see his wife and children when he reached his country  after such a journey  you decided not to even ask about them  until you test your wife  she sits at home  passing each night in misery  each day in tears  for my part  i have never doubted  i felt sure in my heart you would get home   after the loss of all your men  but i did not want conflict with my father s brother  poseidon  who resented you because you blinded his beloved son  now i will show you ithaca  so you believe  this is the bay of phorcys  ancient sea god  and at the head there is an olive tree with long leaves  and nearby  the shady cave sacred to nymphs called nereids  to whom you sacrificed so many hundred cattle   and here is neriton  the wooded mountain   with that  the goddess made the mist disperse  the land was visible  odysseus  after so long a wait and so much pain  was filled with happiness at last  in joy he kissed the fertile earth of his own country  then lifted high his arms and prayed   o nymphs  i never thought i would come back to you  daughters of zeus  accept my loving prayers  and i will give you gifts  as in the past   if my commander  child of zeus  is kind and let us me live and raise my son   athena looked straight into his eyes and said   be brave  you need not worry  let us hurry now to hide the treasure safely in the cave  and then we must make plans   the goddess went down in the murky cave  and looked around for hiding spots  odysseus brought in the presents the phaeacians gave him gold  and tireless bronze and finely woven cloth   athena set them all inside  and fixed the door stone up  and then the two sat down against the sacred olive and they planned how to destroy the suitors  eyes aglow  athena said   great king  laertes  son  master of plots and plans  odysseus  think how to strike the suitors  for three years they have been lording in your house and courting your godlike wife with gifts  she always longs for your return  and grieves  she leads them on  with promises and messages to each  but her mind moves elsewhere   odysseus cried   oh  i would have died like agamemnon in my own house  if you had not explained exactly how things stand  so  goddess  now weave me a strategy to pay them back  stand by me  give me courage and the drive to fight as when i broke the shining crown of troy  if you will join me with that zeal and help me  goddess queen  i could do battle  against three hundred men at once   athena looked straight at him  clear eyed  she said   i will be with you  truly  know i stand beside you as we begin our work  i do believe the suitors who devour your livelihood will spatter your broad floors with blood and brains  but now i will disguise you  so no human can recognize you  i will shrivel up the fine skin of your supple arms and legs  ruin your hair  and dress you up in rags   so everyone will shudder  seeing you  and i will cloud your eyes  to make you seem ugly to all the suitors  and your wife and to the son you left at home  now visit the swineherd who  though he is just a slave  adores your son and wise penelope and is your friend  go look for him among the sows who root beside the corax rock and near the spring of arethusa  drinking black water  eating good nutritious acorns   which fatten pigs  stay there and sit with him  and ask him everything  and i will go to sparta  where the girls are beautiful  to fetch telemachus  the boy you love  he went to menelaus  to find out if you are still alive   he asked her sharply   but why did you not tell him  you must know everything  did you want him suffering like me  lost out at sea  while others eat his whole inheritance   with shining eyes  athena answered   come now  do not worry about the boy  i guided him myself so that he might win glory by his journey  he is not suffering  he is away  sitting and banqueting with menelaus  the suitors do indeed desire to kill him  and wait in ambush for him in their ship  but they will not succeed  i think  the earth will cover one or more of those who eat your property   then with her wand athena  tapped him  his handsome body withered up  his limbs became arthritic  she bleached out his hair  and made his skin look old and wrinkled  and dimmed his fine bright eyes  she turned his clothes into a tattered cloak and ragged tunic  dirty with soot  she wrapped around his shoulders a massive leather deerskin  and she gave him a threadbare tote bag and a walking stick  their plans were set  they parted  she went off to sparta  to go fetch

A loyal slave leaving the bay, he hiked the rugged path through woodland and across the cliffs; athena had shown him where to go to find the swineherd. of all those in odysseus  household, this noble slave cared most about preserving the master s property. odysseus found him as he was sitting out on his porch. his yard was high and visible for miles, of fieldstones topped with twigs of thorny pear. he built it in the absence of his master,

With no help from laertes or the mistress. around the yard, he set a ring of stakes, of wood with bark stripped off. inside the yard, he made twelve sties all next to one another, for breeding sows, with fifty in each one. the boars slept outside; there were fewer of them, because the suitors kept on eating them. the swineherd let them have the fattest boars; just three hundred and sixty still remained. their captain kept four fierce half-wild dogs

To guard the gate. now he was cutting oxhide to make himself some sandals. of his men, three herded up the pigs, and ran around in all directions; he had sent the fourth to town to take a pig to those proud suitors. he had no choice; he had to satisfy their cravings for fresh meat. then suddenly the guard dogs saw odysseus, and rushed towards him with loud barks. he kept his head, and sank down to the ground and dropped his stick.

They would have hurt him terribly, and shamed him on his own property but acting fast the swineherd dropped his leatherwork and rushed to chase the dogs away. he yelled at them and pelted them with stones to make them scatter. and then he told his master,  my dogs almost ripped you apart, old man! you would have brought me shame, when the gods are hurting me already. i am in mourning for an absent master, raising his pigs for other men to eat.

My lord is lost and maybe even hungry, in lands where the people speak in foreign tongues  if he is even still alive, still seeing the sunlight. well now, follow me, old man, fill up on food and wine, then tell me where you come from, and the troubles you have borne.  the noble swineherd heaped up cushy brushwood, and spread a furry goatskin over it his own bed-blanket, thick and warm. odysseus sat down and was delighted at this welcome.

He said,  may zeus and all the deathless gods reward you with your heart s desire, because you welcomed me so willingly.  and you, eumaeus, answered,  one must honor guests and foreigners and strangers, even those much poorer than oneself. zeus watches over beggars and guests and strangers. what i have to give is small, but i will give it gladly. life is like this for slaves: we live in fear, when younger men have power over us.

My real lord is kept from home by gods. he would have taken care of me, and given what kindly owners give to loyal slaves: a house with land, and wife whom many men would want as recompense for years of labor which gods have blessed and made to prosper. master would have been good to me, if he had stayed here till old age. he must be dead by now. damn helen and her family! so many have died for her sake. master went to troy,

To win back agamemnon s honor, fighting the trojans.  then he belted up his tunic and hurried to the pen, and chose two piglets. inside he butchered them, singed off the bristles, chopped up the meat and roasted it on skewers. he set it, piping hot, before his guest, sprinkling barley on the top. he mixed wine in an ivy bowl, as sweet as honey, and then sat down across from him, and urged,  now, guest, eat up! this is a poor slave s meal:

A suckling pig. the suitors eat the hogs. their hearts have no compassion! they ignore the gods, who watch and hate such crimes and bless good deeds and justice. even cutthroat pirates, who go to plunder other people s lands, seizing the spoils that zeus has granted them, and sail home in a ship filled full of treasure  even they feel the watchful eyes of gods. these suitors must have heard some god s voice saying,  odysseus has died.  so they refuse

To go back to their own homes or to arrange suitable marriages. instead they sit, wasting his wealth on feasts. each night and day they butcher sheep, not one but dozens of them, and pour out yet more wine for reckless drinking. those selfish oafs! my lord was very rich; no others on the mainland or back here in ithaca, nor twenty all combined, possessed as much. i will list all of it. twelve herds of cattle on the mainland, twelve

Of sheep, and twelve of pigs, and twelve of goats. he had to hire more laborers to help us. and out here on the far end of the island, eleven herds of goats are grazing, watched by good men. every day, a herdsman takes whichever goat seems fattest and most healthy up to the palace. i, who watch these pigs, must choose the best for them.  odysseus gratefully wolfed the meat and drank the wine in silence. he was hatching plots to ruin

The suitors. after he had had enough to eat, he took the wine-cup he had drunk from, filled it again and gave it to eumaeus, who took it gladly. then odysseus said,  friend, who bought you? this rich, noble man that you describe who is he? you say he died in the war for agamemnon s honor. perhaps i know him, since he must be famous. zeus and the other gods will be aware if i have seen him and can bring you news.

He traveled widely.  but the swineherd said,  his wife and son will not trust travelers who claim to bring them news. tramps always lie to get a meal they have no cause to tell the truth. all those who pass through ithaca go to my mistress spinning foolish tales. she welcomes them and questions them, while tears stream from her eyes, and rightly so: a wife should mourn for her dead husband. sir, you also would weave tall tales if you got clothes for it.

But in reality, my master s skin has been ripped off his bones by birds of prey and dogs; his life is gone. or he has been eaten at sea by fish; his bones are lying upon the beach, heaped high with sand. his death is ruin for us all, especially me, since i will never have so kind a master, however far i go, not even if i go back to the home of my own parents who gave me birth and brought me up. i wish

That i could see them, in my native land. but i grieve less for my own family than for odysseus. i miss him so. i hesitate to call him by his name, stranger: i would prefer to call him  brother,  even when he is far away, because he loved and cared for me with so much kindness.  odysseus was self-restrained. he said,  my friend, you are so adamant, insisting that he will not come back. you have no faith.

But this is no tall tale: i swear to you odysseus is on his way. and when he is in his own house, then i will claim my prize as messenger some better clothes. till then, i will take nothing, though i need them. i hate like hades  gates the man who caves to poverty, and starts to lie. i swear by zeus, and by the welcome that you gave me, and by the hearth of great odysseus, where i am going: all this will turn out

As i say now. odysseus will come, within this very cycle of the moon: between the waning and the waxing time, he will come home, and pay back all those here who disrespect his wife and noble son.  you answered him, swineherd eumaeus,  sir, i will not give you this reward, since he will not come home. relax and drink. let us think about other things. do not remind me. my heart is troubled when a person mentions

My faithful master. never mind your oath. i hope he comes, as do penelope and old laertes and telemachus. may it come true. but i cannot forget my grief for that poor boy, my master s son. thanks to the gods, he grew up like a tree, handsome and strong, as if to match his father when he becomes a man. but somebody or some god ruined his good sense. he went to pylos, seeking news about his father.

The suitors lie in wait for when he comes back home, and soon arcesius  line will be wiped out on ithaca. no more. they may catch him, or he may get away, kept safe by zeus. now tell me, sir, the truth about your own adventures. where are you from? where do your parents live? where is your town? on what boat did you sail here? how did sailors bring you to ithaca? and who were they? i know you did not reach this land by foot. 

Odysseus said cunningly,  i will tell you the truth, the whole truth. how i wish we two could sit at ease here in this cottage, and we had food and sweet strong wine to last as long as we desired, while all the work was done by others! even if i talked a whole year, i would not complete the story of everything the gods have made me suffer. proudly i say, i come from spacious crete, the son of wealthy castor hylacides,

Whose sons by his main wife were numerous, raised in his house. my mother was a slave, bought as a concubine, and yet my father respected me like all his other sons. the cretan people held him in high honor as if he were a god, since he was rich and had such noble sons. but fate arrived to take him down to hades. then my brothers selfishly seized his property, and gave only a tiny part to me, with barely

A place to live. but i was not a weakling, or cowardly in fighting. my great skill and talent helped me win a wife who had a decent dowry all lost now. but you can see in stubble how the grain once grew, though i am crushed by grief. i have the gift of courage from athena and from ares. whenever i chose warriors to ambush our enemies, i never thought of death. i leapt out far in front, and ran to catch them

And spear them. that was how i was in war. i did not like farmwork or housekeeping, or raising children. i liked sailing better, and war with spears and arrows, deadly weapons. others may shudder at such things, but gods made my heart love them. people s preferences are different. before the greeks went off to march on troy, i led my troops and fleet on nine forays, with great success. i had my pick of all the spoils, and got much more

When we shared out the winnings. soon my house grew rich; i was a fine, important man among the cretans. but far-seeing zeus arranged that expedition of disaster, which made so many men collapse and fall. the people wanted me to sail to troy with idomeneus. we had no choice; their will was strong, constraining us. we greeks fought for nine years, and in the tenth we sacked the town of priam, and sailed home. some god

Scattered the greeks, and i was cursed by zeus. i stayed for just one month at home, enjoying my children and my wife and my possessions. some impulse made me want to sail to egypt, with nine ships and a godlike crew. i rushed to get the fleet prepared and gather up the men. i paid for many animals, to kill as sacrifices for the gods and for the men to cook and eat. we feasted six days, then on the seventh we embarked

And sailed from crete. a fair north wind was blowing so we could drift on easily, like floating downstream. no one got sick, and all our ships came through undamaged. we sat tight, and let the wind and pilot guide us over seas. in five days we had reached the river valley of egypt; my fleet docked inside the nile. i told the loyal men to wait and guard the ships while i sent scouts to check around from points of higher ground. but they indulged

Their own aggressive impulses, and started willfully doing damage to the fields of egypt and enslaved the little children and women, and they killed the men. the news soon reached the city; people heard the screaming, and right away at dawn, they all arrived. the plain was filled with warriors on foot, and chariots and gleaming bronze, and zeus, the lord of lightning, caused my men to panic. they dared not keep on fighting; danger lurked

On every side. then many of my men were killed with sharp bronze spears; the rest were taken as slaves to work for them. i wish i too had died in egypt! but more pain remained. zeus put another plan into my mind. i took my helmet off my head and dropped my shield and sword, and unarmed i approached the king. beside his chariot i grasped his knees and kissed them. he was merciful; he kept me safe, and took me home with him,

Riding his chariot. my eyes were wet. many egyptians were enraged with me, and tried to kill me with their spears; the king protected me he feared the wrath of zeus, the god of strangers, who hates wickedness. i stayed there seven years and gained great wealth; all the egyptian people gave me gifts. but in the eighth, an avaricious man came from phoenicia. he was good at lying, skilled and well practiced at exploiting people.

He tricked me into going off with him back to phoenicia, where he lived. i stayed a year, but when the hours and days and months had rolled around again, he made me sail over the seas to libya, pretending that i would go with him to do some trading. his true plan was to sell me for a profit. i had suspicions, but i climbed on board. the ship sailed out with fair north wind behind her from crete out into open sea. but zeus

Planned to destroy the crew. on leaving crete, no other land was visible, but only the sea and sky. zeus set a dark-blue cloud across our ship that cast a shadow over the sea. he thundered and then hurled a bolt of lightning at the ship. the impact whirled the ship right round and filled her up with sulfur. the men fell overboard and all were swept away by waves, like cormorants beside the dark ship, and gods took away their chance

Of getting home. but in my desperation zeus rescued me. he put the sturdy mast into my hands. i clung to it and drifted, propelled by storm winds for nine days. and on the tenth black night, the rolling waters swept me towards thesprotia. there the king, named pheidon, helped me without expecting recompense because his son had found me all worn out, chilled by the morning air. he took my hand, raised me and led me to his father s house,

And dressed me. that was where i heard about odysseus the king said he had been a guest there on his journey home. the king showed me the treasure that odysseus had gathered: gold and bronze and hard-worked iron. the royal stores contained enough to feed his family for ten more generations. odysseus, the king said, had gone off to dodona, to ask the holy oak what zeus intended. he had been too long

Away from fertile ithaca. he wondered how best to get back home in some disguise or openly. the king then swore to me, pouring libations, that he had a boat prepared and crew picked out, to take him back to his dear homeland. but he sent me first; it happened some thesprotians were already sailing towards grain-rich dulichium. the king told them to treat me well and take me to king acastus. but their hearts preferred

To bring me once again to misery. after the ship was out upon the sea, they plotted to enslave me. they stripped off my cloak and tunic, and tossed me these rags in which you see me now. and when night fell they came to ithaca s bright fields, and tied me tightly with rope and left me on the ship, and quickly went ashore to get some dinner. the gods themselves unloosed my bonds; they slipped easily off. i pulled my ragged clothes

Over my head, slid down the smooth ship s plank and plunged chest-forward in the sea. i swam fast with both arms, and quickly got away. i came ashore beside a flowering thicket and huddled there in fear. they stomped around, shouting, but in a while they gave up looking, and got back on the ship. the gods themselves hid me with ease, and brought me to this cottage  a wise man s home because it is my fate to stay alive.  eumaeus, you replied,

 poor guest! your tale of woe is very moving, but pointless; i will not believe a word about odysseus. why did you stoop to tell those silly lies? i know about my master s homecoming. the gods detest him; they loathe him, since they did not let him die at troy or in his friends  arms, when the war was winding up, so that the greeks could build a mound to glorify him and his son in times to come. the robber-winds have snatched him.

He has no glory now. i am a loner; i live here with the pigs, and do not go to town, except when wise penelope calls me to share some news. the people cluster around her, asking questions some in sorrow about their absent master; others glad to eat at his expense. i ask no questions, since an aetolian fooled me with his lies. he came to my house, saying he had killed a man in distant parts and run away.

I welcomed him. he said that he had seen odysseus with idomeneus in crete, repairing ships that storms had wrecked. he promised that my lord would come in summer or harvesttime, made rich by heaps of treasure, his crew complete. a god has brought you here; but do not try to trick me or make nice with lies. i will be kind to you, old man, not for your stories, but in fear of zeus, the god of strangers, and because i feel

Pity for you.  but sly odysseus answered,  you are too skeptical! despite my oath, i see you will not trust me. may the gods of mount olympus be our witness that if your master ever comes back home to this house, you will give me clothes to wear, and help me to dulichium i want to go there. but if he does not arrive, and i am wrong, your slaves can drive me over the cliff tops, so no other beggar tries

To trick you.  but the upright swineherd answered,  yes, guest, i would be praised enormously among all men, now and in times to come, if i took you inside and welcomed you, then murdered you! and doing this, with what clean conscience could i pray to zeus? in any case, now it is dinnertime. my men should come inside, so we can cook delicious food.  that was their conversation. in came the herdsmen, and they drove the pigs

Into their usual pens to rest; there rose a mighty din of grunting pigs. the noble swineherd addressed his men.  bring out the best pig for our guest, who comes from distant lands. and let us all enjoy ourselves. we suffer in bitter toil for these white-tusked pigs, while others eat the food we labor for, and give us nothing.  with a keen bronze axe he chopped the wood. they brought a fattened pig of five years old and put it on the altar.

The swineherd s heart was good: he kept in mind the gods. he shaved the bristles off its head, and threw them in the fire, and prayed to all the gods, that through his ingenuity, his master would come home. he stretched up tall, and used a piece of oaken firewood to strike. the life departed, and they slit the throat and singed the hide, and chopped it up. the swineherd made an offering of meat, laid flesh across the fine rich fat, and put it

Upon the fire with barley-grain on top, and sliced the rest and put it all on skewers, and roasted it with care, then drew the meat off and heaped it high on platters. next he stood and served it out in seven equal parts, the first with prayers, for hermes and the nymphs, and then he served the others to the men. he gave odysseus the piece of honor, cut from the spine. his master was delighted, and said,  eumaeus, may zeus bless and love you

As i do, since you give me such good things.  you answered him, swineherd eumaeus,  eat, dear guest; enjoy it, simple though it is. gods give, gods take away, as is their will; to gods all things are possible.  with that, he made the sacrifices to the gods, poured a libation from the bright red wine, then gave odysseus, the city-sacker, the cup. at last the swineherd sat to eat. mesaulius served the food that was the slave

Bought by eumaeus in his master s absence, with no help from his mistress or laertes. he traded him from taphians. they all reached out to take the good things set before them. when they had had enough of food and drink, mesaulius cleared things away; the men were full of bread and meat, and wanting sleep. night fell, a moonless, bitter night. zeus rained continually; wet zephyr blew his hardest. odysseus to test out if eumaeus

Was kind enough to take his own cloak off, or tell another man to do it said,  eumaeus and you others, all of you. i want to brag a little. i am dizzy, under the influence of wine, which makes even the wisest people sing and giggle, and dance, and say things best not spoken. since i have begun this blabbering, here goes, i will be honest. i wish i was young and strong again! as when we planned an ambush

Under the walls of troy the leading men were menelaus and odysseus, and i was chosen as the third commander. when we had reached the city wall, we lay in bushes, reeds, and marshes, hiding under our shields. night fell, harsh and icy cold, with north wind and a sleetlike snow, so cold the ice grew on our weapons. all the others had cloaks; they slept in comfort, tucked beneath their shields. but i had foolishly forgotten

My cloak and left it, not expecting cold. i carried just my shield and shining belt. in the last part of night, as stars were setting, i went near to odysseus and nudged him. he listened to me carefully. i said,  your majesty, odysseus, great general, i am about to die from this cold weather! i have no cloak. some spirit tricked me into wearing my tunic only; now there is no way to fix it.  instantly he thought

Of this solution. what a strategist and fighter! very quietly he whispered,  hush now, do not let any of the others hear you.  he propped his head up on his elbow, and told them,  listen, friends. i had a dream sent by the gods. we moved too far away from where the ships are. someone needs to speak to agamemnon, shepherd of the people, and tell him to send more troops here.  at that, thoas the son of andraimon leapt up,

Took off his purple cloak and sprinted down towards the ships. i snuggled down in comfort under his cloak till golden dawn shone bright. if only i was young and strong again! then one of these pig-keepers on this farm would give a cloak to me, both from respect and friendship. as it is, they all despise me for wearing dirty rags.  eumaeus, you replied,  that was a splendid tale, old man! it worked. you will get all the clothes and things

A poor old beggar needs at least for now. but in the morning, you will have to put your old rags on again. we only have one outfit each, no spares. my master s son will give you clothes when he arrives, and help you to travel on wherever you desire.  with that, he stood and set a bed for him beside the fire, and threw on it some skins of sheep and goats. odysseus lay down. eumaeus tucked him in a big thick cloak,

His extra one, for really bitter weather. odysseus went to sleep; the young men slept beside him. but the swineherd did not like to sleep so distant from the pigs; he started to leave. odysseus was glad the slave took good care of his absent master s things. eumaeus slung his sharp sword belt across his well-toned back, and wrapped around himself his windproof cloak and fine big furry goatskin. he took a sharpened knife to ward away

Humans or dogs, and he went off to sleep out where the pigs with silver tusks were sleeping; a hanging rock protected them from wind.",a loyal slave leaving the bay  he hiked the rugged path through woodland and across the cliffs  athena had shown him where to go to find the swineherd  of all those in odysseus  household  this noble slave cared most about preserving the master s property  odysseus found him as he was sitting out on his porch  his yard was high and visible for miles  of fieldstones topped with twigs of thorny pear  he built it in the absence of his master   with no help from laertes or the mistress  around the yard  he set a ring of stakes  of wood with bark stripped off  inside the yard  he made twelve sties all next to one another  for breeding sows  with fifty in each one  the boars slept outside  there were fewer of them  because the suitors kept on eating them  the swineherd let them have the fattest boars  just three hundred and sixty still remained  their captain kept four fierce half wild dogs  to guard the gate  now he was cutting oxhide to make himself some sandals  of his men  three herded up the pigs  and ran around in all directions  he had sent the fourth to town to take a pig to those proud suitors  he had no choice  he had to satisfy their cravings for fresh meat  then suddenly the guard dogs saw odysseus  and rushed towards him with loud barks  he kept his head  and sank down to the ground and dropped his stick   they would have hurt him terribly  and shamed him on his own property but acting fast the swineherd dropped his leatherwork and rushed to chase the dogs away  he yelled at them and pelted them with stones to make them scatter  and then he told his master   my dogs almost ripped you apart  old man  you would have brought me shame  when the gods are hurting me already  i am in mourning for an absent master  raising his pigs for other men to eat   my lord is lost and maybe even hungry  in lands where the people speak in foreign tongues  if he is even still alive  still seeing the sunlight  well now  follow me  old man  fill up on food and wine  then tell me where you come from  and the troubles you have borne   the noble swineherd heaped up cushy brushwood  and spread a furry goatskin over it his own bed blanket  thick and warm  odysseus sat down and was delighted at this welcome   he said   may zeus and all the deathless gods reward you with your heart s desire  because you welcomed me so willingly   and you  eumaeus  answered   one must honor guests and foreigners and strangers  even those much poorer than oneself  zeus watches over beggars and guests and strangers  what i have to give is small  but i will give it gladly  life is like this for slaves  we live in fear  when younger men have power over us   my real lord is kept from home by gods  he would have taken care of me  and given what kindly owners give to loyal slaves  a house with land  and wife whom many men would want as recompense for years of labor which gods have blessed and made to prosper  master would have been good to me  if he had stayed here till old age  he must be dead by now  damn helen and her family  so many have died for her sake  master went to troy   to win back agamemnon s honor  fighting the trojans   then he belted up his tunic and hurried to the pen  and chose two piglets  inside he butchered them  singed off the bristles  chopped up the meat and roasted it on skewers  he set it  piping hot  before his guest  sprinkling barley on the top  he mixed wine in an ivy bowl  as sweet as honey  and then sat down across from him  and urged   now  guest  eat up  this is a poor slave s meal   a suckling pig  the suitors eat the hogs  their hearts have no compassion  they ignore the gods  who watch and hate such crimes and bless good deeds and justice  even cutthroat pirates  who go to plunder other people s lands  seizing the spoils that zeus has granted them  and sail home in a ship filled full of treasure  even they feel the watchful eyes of gods  these suitors must have heard some god s voice saying   odysseus has died   so they refuse  to go back to their own homes or to arrange suitable marriages  instead they sit  wasting his wealth on feasts  each night and day they butcher sheep  not one but dozens of them  and pour out yet more wine for reckless drinking  those selfish oafs  my lord was very rich  no others on the mainland or back here in ithaca  nor twenty all combined  possessed as much  i will list all of it  twelve herds of cattle on the mainland  twelve  of sheep  and twelve of pigs  and twelve of goats  he had to hire more laborers to help us  and out here on the far end of the island  eleven herds of goats are grazing  watched by good men  every day  a herdsman takes whichever goat seems fattest and most healthy up to the palace  i  who watch these pigs  must choose the best for them   odysseus gratefully wolfed the meat and drank the wine in silence  he was hatching plots to ruin  the suitors  after he had had enough to eat  he took the wine cup he had drunk from  filled it again and gave it to eumaeus  who took it gladly  then odysseus said   friend  who bought you  this rich  noble man that you describe who is he  you say he died in the war for agamemnon s honor  perhaps i know him  since he must be famous  zeus and the other gods will be aware if i have seen him and can bring you news   he traveled widely   but the swineherd said   his wife and son will not trust travelers who claim to bring them news  tramps always lie to get a meal they have no because to tell the truth  all those who pass through ithaca go to my mistress spinning foolish tales  she welcomes them and questions them  while tears stream from her eyes  and rightly so  a wife should mourn for her dead husband  sir  you also would weave tall tales if you got clothes for it   but in reality  my master s skin has been ripped off his bones by birds of prey and dogs  his life is gone  or he has been eaten at sea by fish  his bones are lying upon the beach  heaped high with sand  his death is ruin for us all  especially me  since i will never have so kind a master  however far i go  not even if i go back to the home of my own parents who gave me birth and brought me up  i wish  that i could see them  in my native land  but i grieve less for my own family than for odysseus  i miss him so  i hesitate to call him by his name  stranger  i would prefer to call him  brother   even when he is far away  because he loved and cared for me with so much kindness   odysseus was self restrained  he said   my friend  you are so adamant  insisting that he will not come back  you have no faith   but this is no tall tale  i swear to you odysseus is on his way  and when he is in his own house  then i will claim my prize as messenger some better clothes  till then  i will take nothing  though i need them  i hate like hades  gates the man who caves to poverty  and starts to lie  i swear by zeus  and by the welcome that you gave me  and by the hearth of great odysseus  where i am going  all this will turn out  as i say now  odysseus will come  within this very cycle of the moon  between the waning and the waxing time  he will come home  and pay back all those here who disrespect his wife and noble son   you answered him  swineherd eumaeus   sir  i will not give you this reward  since he will not come home  relax and drink  let us think about other things  do not remind me  my heart is troubled when a person mentions  my faithful master  never mind your oath  i hope he comes  as do penelope and old laertes and telemachus  may it come true  but i cannot forget my grief for that poor boy  my master s son  thanks to the gods  he grew up like a tree  handsome and strong  as if to match his father when he becomes a man  but somebody or some god ruined his good sense  he went to pylos  seeking news about his father   the suitors lie in wait for when he comes back home  and soon arcesius  line will be wiped out on ithaca  no more  they may catch him  or he may get away  kept safe by zeus  now tell me  sir  the truth about your own adventures  where are you from  where do your parents live  where is your town  on what boat did you sail here  how did sailors bring you to ithaca  and who were they  i know you did not reach this land by foot    odysseus said cunningly   i will tell you the truth  the whole truth  how i wish we two could sit at ease here in this cottage  and we had food and sweet strong wine to last as long as we desired  while all the work was done by others  even if i talked a whole year  i would not complete the story of everything the gods have made me suffer  proudly i say  i come from spacious crete  the son of wealthy castor hylacides   whose sons by his main wife were numerous  raised in his house  my mother was a slave  bought as a concubine  and yet my father respected me like all his other sons  the cretan people held him in high honor as if he were a god  since he was rich and had such noble sons  but fate arrived to take him down to hades  then my brothers selfishly seized his property  and gave only a tiny part to me  with barely  a place to live  but i was not a weakling  or cowardly in fighting  my great skill and talent helped me win a wife who had a decent dowry all lost now  but you can see in stubble how the grain once grew  though i am crushed by grief  i have the gift of courage from athena and from ares  whenever i chose warriors to ambush our enemies  i never thought of death  i leapt out far in front  and ran to catch them  and spear them  that was how i was in war  i did not like farmwork or housekeeping  or raising children  i liked sailing better  and war with spears and arrows  deadly weapons  others may shudder at such things  but gods made my heart love them  people s preferences are different  before the greeks went off to march on troy  i led my troops and fleet on nine forays  with great success  i had my pick of all the spoils  and got much more  when we shared out the winnings  soon my house grew rich  i was a fine  important man among the cretans  but far seeing zeus arranged that expedition of disaster  which made so many men collapse and fall  the people wanted me to sail to troy with idomeneus  we had no choice  their will was strong  constraining us  we greeks fought for nine years  and in the tenth we sacked the town of priam  and sailed home  some god  scattered the greeks  and i was cursed by zeus  i stayed for just one month at home  enjoying my children and my wife and my possessions  some impulse made me want to sail to egypt  with nine ships and a godlike crew  i rushed to get the fleet prepared and gather up the men  i paid for many animals  to kill as sacrifices for the gods and for the men to cook and eat  we feasted six days  then on the seventh we embarked  and sailed from crete  a fair north wind was blowing so we could drift on easily  like floating downstream  no one got sick  and all our ships came through undamaged  we sat tight  and let the wind and pilot guide us over seas  in five days we had reached the river valley of egypt  my fleet docked inside the nile  i told the loyal men to wait and guard the ships while i sent scouts to check around from points of higher ground  but they indulged  their own aggressive impulses  and started willfully doing damage to the fields of egypt and enslaved the little children and women  and they killed the men  the news soon reached the city  people heard the screaming  and right away at dawn  they all arrived  the plain was filled with warriors on foot  and chariots and gleaming bronze  and zeus  the lord of lightning  caused my men to panic  they dared not keep on fighting  danger lurked  on every side  then many of my men were killed with sharp bronze spears  the rest were taken as slaves to work for them  i wish i too had died in egypt  but more pain remained  zeus put another plan into my mind  i took my helmet off my head and dropped my shield and sword  and unarmed i approached the king  beside his chariot i grasped his knees and kissed them  he was merciful  he kept me safe  and took me home with him   riding his chariot  my eyes were wet  many egyptians were enraged with me  and tried to kill me with their spears  the king protected me he feared the wrath of zeus  the god of strangers  who hates wickedness  i stayed there seven years and gained great wealth  all the egyptian people gave me gifts  but in the eighth  an avaricious man came from phoenicia  he was good at lying  skilled and well practiced at exploiting people   he tricked me into going off with him back to phoenicia  where he lived  i stayed a year  but when the hours and days and months had rolled around again  he made me sail over the seas to libya  pretending that i would go with him to do some trading  his true plan was to sell me for a profit  i had suspicions  but i climbed on board  the ship sailed out with fair north wind behind her from crete out into open sea  but zeus  planned to destroy the crew  on leaving crete  no other land was visible  but only the sea and sky  zeus set a dark blue cloud across our ship that cast a shadow over the sea  he thundered and then hurled a bolt of lightning at the ship  the impact whirled the ship right round and filled her up with sulfur  the men fell overboard and all were swept away by waves  like cormorants beside the dark ship  and gods took away their chance  of getting home  but in my desperation zeus rescued me  he put the sturdy mast into my hands  i clung to it and drifted  propelled by storm winds for nine days  and on the tenth black night  the rolling waters swept me towards thesprotia  there the king  named pheidon  helped me without expecting recompense because his son had found me all worn out  chilled by the morning air  he took my hand  raised me and led me to his father s house   and dressed me  that was where i heard about odysseus the king said he had been a guest there on his journey home  the king showed me the treasure that odysseus had gathered  gold and bronze and hard worked iron  the royal stores contained enough to feed his family for ten more generations  odysseus  the king said  had gone off to dodona  to ask the holy oak what zeus intended  he had been too long  away from fertile ithaca  he wondered how best to get back home in some disguise or openly  the king then swore to me  pouring libations  that he had a boat prepared and crew picked out  to take him back to his dear homeland  but he sent me first  it happened some thesprotians were already sailing towards grain rich dulichium  the king told them to treat me well and take me to king acastus  but their hearts preferred  to bring me once again to misery  after the ship was out upon the sea  they plotted to enslave me  they stripped off my cloak and tunic  and tossed me these rags in which you see me now  and when night fell they came to ithaca s bright fields  and tied me tightly with rope and left me on the ship  and quickly went ashore to get some dinner  the gods themselves unloosed my bonds  they slipped easily off  i pulled my ragged clothes  over my head  slid down the smooth ship s plank and plunged chest forward in the sea  i swam fast with both arms  and quickly got away  i came ashore beside a flowering thicket and huddled there in fear  they stomped around  shouting  but in a while they gave up looking  and got back on the ship  the gods themselves hid me with ease  and brought me to this cottage  a wise man s home because it is my fate to stay alive   eumaeus  you replied    poor guest  your tale of woe is very moving  but pointless  i will not believe a word about odysseus  why did you stoop to tell those silly lies  i know about my master s homecoming  the gods detest him  they loathe him  since they did not let him die at troy or in his friends  arms  when the war was winding up  so that the greeks could build a mound to glorify him and his son in times to come  the robber winds have snatched him   he has no glory now  i am a loner  i live here with the pigs  and do not go to town  except when wise penelope calls me to share some news  the people cluster around her  asking questions some in sorrow about their absent master  others glad to eat at his expense  i ask no questions  since an aetolian fooled me with his lies  he came to my house  saying he had killed a man in distant parts and run away   i welcomed him  he said that he had seen odysseus with idomeneus in crete  repairing ships that storms had wrecked  he promised that my lord would come in summer or harvesttime  made rich by heaps of treasure  his crew complete  a god has brought you here  but do not try to trick me or make nice with lies  i will be kind to you  old man  not for your stories  but in fear of zeus  the god of strangers  and because i feel  pity for you   but sly odysseus answered   you are too skeptical  despite my oath  i see you will not trust me  may the gods of mount olympus be our witness that if your master ever comes back home to this house  you will give me clothes to wear  and help me to dulichium i want to go there  but if he does not arrive  and i am wrong  your slaves can drive me over the cliff tops  so no other beggar tries  to trick you   but the upright swineherd answered   yes  guest  i would be praised enormously among all men  now and in times to come  if i took you inside and welcomed you  then murdered you  and doing this  with what clean conscience could i pray to zeus  in any case  now it is dinnertime  my men should come inside  so we can cook delicious food   that was their conversation  in came the herdsmen  and they drove the pigs  into their usual pens to rest  there rose a mighty din of grunting pigs  the noble swineherd addressed his men   bring out the best pig for our guest  who comes from distant lands  and let us all enjoy ourselves  we suffer in bitter toil for these white tusked pigs  while others eat the food we labor for  and give us nothing   with a keen bronze axe he chopped the wood  they brought a fattened pig of five years old and put it on the altar   the swineherd s heart was good  he kept in mind the gods  he shaved the bristles off its head  and threw them in the fire  and prayed to all the gods  that through his ingenuity  his master would come home  he stretched up tall  and used a piece of oaken firewood to strike  the life departed  and they slit the throat and singed the hide  and chopped it up  the swineherd made an offering of meat  laid flesh across the fine rich fat  and put it  upon the fire with barley grain on top  and sliced the rest and put it all on skewers  and roasted it with care  then drew the meat off and heaped it high on platters  next he stood and served it out in seven equal parts  the first with prayers  for hermes and the nymphs  and then he served the others to the men  he gave odysseus the piece of honor  cut from the spine  his master was delighted  and said   eumaeus  may zeus bless and love you  as i do  since you give me such good things   you answered him  swineherd eumaeus   eat  dear guest  enjoy it  simple though it is  gods give  gods take away  as is their will  to gods all things are possible   with that  he made the sacrifices to the gods  poured a libation from the bright red wine  then gave odysseus  the city sacker  the cup  at last the swineherd sat to eat  mesaulius served the food that was the slave  bought by eumaeus in his master s absence  with no help from his mistress or laertes  he traded him from taphians  they all reached out to take the good things set before them  when they had had enough of food and drink  mesaulius cleared things away  the men were full of bread and meat  and wanting sleep  night fell  a moonless  bitter night  zeus rained continually  wet zephyr blew his hardest  odysseus to test out if eumaeus  was kind enough to take his own cloak off  or tell another man to do it said   eumaeus and you others  all of you  i want to brag a little  i am dizzy  under the influence of wine  which makes even the wisest people sing and giggle  and dance  and say things best not spoken  since i have begun this blabbering  here goes  i will be honest

Your full consent. you know how women are  they want to help the house of any man they marry. when one darling husband dies, his wife forgets him, and her children by him. she does not even ask how they are doing. let your best slave girl watch your property, until the gods give you your own wife. also, i have more news: take note. there is a gang of suitors lurking in the stream between your ithaca and rocky same, who

Have plans to kill you on your journey home. but i suspect that some of those who waste your wealth will soon be lying under earth. now steer your ship far distant from the islands, and sail both day and night. some god who guards and watches over you will send fair wind behind your sails. when you first reach the shore of ithaca, your men must drag the ship up to the town, while you first go and visit the swineherd, who is better than most slaves.

Spend the night there. tell him to go to town to tell penelope that you have come safely back home from pylos.  with these words the goddess went back up to mount olympus. he woke the son of nestor with a kick, and said to him,  pisistratus! go fetch the horses, get them harnessed to the carriage, and let us hurry on our way.  he answered,  telemachus, this is impossible, for us to drive when it is pitch-black night,

However eager we may be to travel. dawn will come soon. wait till great menelaus comes out to bring us presents in his carriage, and sends us on our way with friendly words. a generous host is sure to be remembered as long as his guests live.  then all at once dawn on her golden throne lit up the sky. king menelaus got up from the bed he shared with fair-haired helen and approached them. seeing him on his way, telemachus

Put on his bright white tunic, and then slung his mighty sword across his sturdy shoulders. so in a warlike guise, the well-loved son of godlike king odysseus stood near and spoke to menelaus.  royal son of atreus, now, please, send me home now, to my beloved country. my heart yearns to go back home.  and menelaus answered,  telemachus, i will not keep you here if you are truly desperate for home.

I disapprove of too much friendliness and of too much standoffishness. a balance is best. to force a visitor to stay is just as bad as pushing him to go. be kind to guests while they are visiting, then help them on their way. so friend, remain just till i fetch some splendid gifts to pile onto your carriage. wait till you see them! i will instruct the women to prepare a banquet in the hall from our rich stores.

Feasting before a long trip brings you honor; it also makes good sense. and if you want to have me travel with you all through greece, i shall yoke up my horses and escort you through every town, and everywhere we go we will be given gifts a fine bronze tripod, a cauldron, or two mules, or golden cups.  telemachus replied,  king menelaus, i want to go home right away. i have no one back there to watch my property.

I would not want to die while i am searching for father, or to lose my wealth at home.  so general menelaus shouted out to tell his wife and female slaves to make a feast from his rich stores. eteoneus got out of bed and came he lived nearby. the general boomed out orders:  light the fire and roast the meat!  the slave obeyed. meanwhile, his master went inside the fragrant room containing treasures. helen went with him,

And megapenthes. there he took a goblet, two-handled, and he told his son to bring a silver bowl. and helen stood beside the chests in which she kept the special clothes that she had worked with her own hands. she lifted the most elaborate and largest robe that shone like starlight under all the rest. then they went through the palace till they reached telemachus. and fair-haired menelaus said to him,  may great zeus, the lord of thunder,

Husband of hera, make your wish come true  may you go back home safely. i will give you the best of all my treasure, as a mark of deep respect: a bowl of solid silver, circled with gold; hephaestus fashioned it. the king of sidon, phaedimus, bestowed it on me when i was at his house, en route for home. now take it; it is yours.  he gave the goblet first, and megapenthes brought the shining silver bowl and put it down

In front of him. then helen s lovely cheeks flushed as she moved in close. she held the robe and said,  sweet boy, i also have a gift, crafted by my own hands. remember helen when your own wedding day at last arrives, and let your bride wear this. until that time, your mother should take care of it. i wish you great joy. i hope you reach your well-built home, and fatherland.  she handed it to him; he took it gladly. prince pisistratus

Took all the gifts and packed them in the luggage, and marveled at them in his heart. the king led them inside; they sat on chairs. a slave girl brought out a beautiful gold water pitcher and silver bowl so she could wash their hands. she set a polished table at their side. another lowly girl brought bread and food of every kind. boethoedes began to carve and serve the meat. the king s son poured the wine for everyone. they helped themselves

To all the delicacies spread before them. when they were satisfied, telemachus and nestor s son strapped on the horses  harness, and yoked them to the chariot and drove off from the echoing portico and gate. but menelaus ran up just behind them, holding a golden cup of honeyed wine in his right hand, so they could pour libations before they left. he stopped in front of them and spreading wide his arms said,  boys, good luck!

Give nestor my best wishes he was always as kind as any father while we greeks were making war in troy.  telemachus said carefully,  yes, king, when we go there we will pass on what you have said. i hope i may go back to ithaca and meet odysseus good luck to match my fortune in all your generosity and kindness.  then on the right an eagle flew; it held a big white goose clutched in its claws a tame one,

Caught from the yard. the people, men and women, were running round and yelling after it. it darted on the right beside the boys, and flew before their horses. they were all delighted. nestor s son was first to speak.  my lord, king menelaus, what do you think? was this a sign sent by some god for us? or sent for you?  and menelaus, favorite of ares, wondered how he ought to answer. but helen cut in first and said,  now listen,

And i will make a prophecy. the gods have put it in my heart and i believe it will come true. just as the eagle flew down from the mountains where he has his home with chicks and parents, seizing this tame goose  so will odysseus, who has been gone so long and has endured so much, come back and take revenge. indeed, he is already at home and planting ruin for the suitors.  telemachus replied,  may thundering zeus

Fulfill your prophecy at once! if so, i would bow down to you as to a goddess.  he whipped the horses and they galloped off through the town center to the open plain. all day the harness rattled as they ran. but when the sun went down and it grew dark, they came to pherae, home of diocles, son of ortilochus, who was the son of alpheus. he welcomed them and there they spent the night. when rosy-fingered dawn

The early-born appeared, they yoked the horses, climbed in the chariot, and drove away from the resounding portico and gate. the horses flew with gusto at the whip. soon they were near the rocky town of pylos. telemachus then asked pisistratus,  would you do me a favor? we are friends because our fathers have been friends forever, and we are age-mates, and this trip has made us even more intimate. please do not bring me

Beyond my ship, but leave me here, in case the old man forces me to visit him and be his guest. i long to get back home. i have to go, and fast.  the son of nestor wondered how he should best respond. he thought upon reflection he should turn the horses back to the ship and shore beside the sea. there he took out the splendid gifts and clothes and gold from menelaus, and he packed them inside the stern, and told telemachus,

 hurry! embark now! get your crew in too, before i get back home and tell my father that you are here. i know him; he is stubborn. he will not let you go; he will come here to fetch you, and he surely will not leave without you. he will be in such a rage!  with that, he spurred the horses. long manes flowing, they galloped to the citadel of pylos. telemachus gave orders:  make it all shipshape, my friends, and get on board, so we

Can start our journey.  quickly they obeyed and sat along the benches. as he worked, with prayers and sacrifices to athena, a foreigner approached him, who had killed a man in argos and had run away. he was a prophet and descended from melampus, who once lived in pylos, land of sheep. melampus had been rich, and owned a palace, but he left his home, escaping from neleus, a proud, important man,

Who seized all his great wealth while he was trapped and tortured in the house of phylacus, because a fury put inside his mind a dangerous obsession with the daughter of neleus. he managed to escape, and drove the cattle, lowing loudly, off from phylace to pylos. he avenged the wrong that neleus had done to him, and brought the woman to his brother s house as wife, then went to argos, home of horses,

Since there it was his destiny to rule the multitude of argives, and he had two strong sons: mantius, and antiphates, who fathered the heroic o cles, whose son was amphiaraus, the warlord, whom zeus who holds the aegis and apollo adored wholeheartedly. but he did not live to old age, since he was killed at thebes, because his wife took bribes. he had two sons, amphilochus and alcmaeon. the sons

Of mantius were clitus, snatched by dawn to join the gods, because he was so handsome, and polypheides, whom apollo gave the best prophetic skill of any mortal after amphiaraus had died. this prophet grew angry with his father, and migrated to hyperisia, and there he told fortunes for everyone. it was his son, named theoclymenus, who had approached telemachus while he was pouring wine

And praying to the gods. the stranger said,  my friend, i find you making sacrifices. i beg you, by religion, by the gods, and by your life and your men s lives: who are you? who are your parents? what is your home town?  telemachus said,  stranger, i will tell you. i come from ithaca; my father is odysseus he was. he must have died some dreadful death by now. it was for him i got this ship and crew. i sailed to seek

News of my absent father.  and the stranger replied,  i too am far from home. i killed a man of my own tribe, and i have many brothers and kinsmen, powerful in argos, so i am on the run. they want to kill me. i have been doomed to homelessness. but please, let me on board your ship. i come to you in desperation otherwise i will surely be killed. those men are after me.  telemachus said,  yes, you can join us

On board our ship. and what we have is yours; you are our guest.  he took the stranger s spear, laid it on deck, then climbed on board himself, sat at the stern, and had his guest sit down beside him at the stern. they loosed the ropes. telemachus gave orders to the men to seize the tackle; promptly they obeyed, and raised the wooden mast and fastened it into the socket, binding it with forestays, and hauled the white sail up with leather cables.

Sharp-eyed athena sent fair wind that gusted a wild explosive breath through bright clear sky; the ship began to race across the sea, past crouni and the lovely streams of chalcis. the sun went down and all the world was dark. impelled by wind from zeus, the ship sped on past phaea and they came to famous elis ruled by the epeians; from there they steered towards the needle islands, still unsure if they would die. meanwhile, odysseus

Was having dinner with the noble swineherd inside the cottage, and the other men were eating with them. after they were done, odysseus began to test the swineherd, to see if he would be hospitable, and ask him to stay there, out on the farm, or send him into town. he said,  eumaeus, listen, and listen all of you. at dawn i plan to go to town to beg i have no wish to be a burden to you all.

I only need directions and a guide who can go with me. i will roam around the city on my own, in search of drink and crusts of bread so it must be. and if i reach the house of king odysseus, i plan to tell penelope my news, and mingle with the high and mighty suitors; they may give me some food from their rich stores. i could do anything they want at once. i have the capability, you see.

Hermes the messenger, the god who gives favor and glorifies all human labor, has blessed me with unrivaled skill in all domestic tasks: fire-laying, splitting logs, carving and roasting meat, and pouring wine  i can do all the chores poor people do to serve the rich.  but angrily you said, eumaeus,  no! why would you think of this? you would be killed if you set foot among that horde of suitors; their aggression reaches

The iron sky. and those who wait on them are not like you. they are young men, well dressed, with bright clean hair and handsome faces, serving the bread and wine and meat, piled high upon their polished tables. stay here. no one minds your presence not myself, nor my companions. and when odysseus  son arrives, he will provide a proper cloak and tunic, and help you travel where your heart desires.  odysseus, experienced in pain,

Answered,  i hope zeus loves you as i do, since you have saved me from the agonies of wandering. the worst thing humans suffer is homelessness; we must endure this life because of desperate hunger; we endure, as migrants with no home. but since you now want me to stay and wait for your young master, tell me about odysseus  parents. his father, when he left, was on the threshold of age. are they alive still? have they died? 

He answered,  stranger, i will tell you truly. laertes is alive, but he is always praying to zeus to let him pass away in his own home. he feels such desperate grief about his son and his beloved wife, whose death made him so heartbroken, he aged before his time. she died a dreadful death, a death i would not wish for any friend  grieving her absent son, the famous hero. while she was still alive, despite her sadness,

She used to like to talk and chat with me  she brought me up herself with her own daughter, strong, pretty ctimene, her youngest child. she raised us both together, treating me almost as equal, just a little less. and when we came of age, they sent the girl to same, for a hefty bridal-price. the mother dressed me in fine clothes, a cloak and tunic, tying sandals on my feet, and sent me to the country. but she still

Loved me with all her heart. i miss them both. the blessed gods have made my work here prosper, so i have had enough to eat and drink and give to guests. but i hear no good news about my mistress. ruin has befallen the house from those invaders. all her slaves miss talking to their owner, getting gossip, sharing some food and drink with her, and taking scraps to the fields with them the kind of thing that makes slaves happy.  and odysseus

Exclaimed,  eumaeus! what a little child you were when you were taken far from home and from your parents! tell me more. did they live in a city that was sacked? or was it bandits that found you, herding sheep or cows alone? did they seize hold of you and put you onto their ship, and sell you for a profit in this man s house?  the swineherd answered him,  since you have asked this question, stranger, listen; enjoy my story, sitting quietly,

Drinking your wine. these nights are magical, with time enough to sleep and to enjoy hearing a tale. you need not sleep too early; it is unhealthy. any other man who feels the need of sleep should go lie down, get up at dawn, have breakfast, and go herd the master s pigs. but let us, you and i, sit in my cottage over food and wine, and take some joy in hearing how much pain we each have suffered. after many years

Of agony and absence from one s home, a person can begin enjoying grief. i will tell you my story as you ask. there is an island you may know it called syria, where the sun turns round, above ortygia. it has few inhabitants, but it is good land, rich in sheep and wine and grain; no famine ever hurts those there, nor any deadly sickness. they grow old, and with their gentle arrows, artemis

And silver-bowed apollo cause their death. the land is split into two provinces; my father ctesius was king of both. then avaricious merchants came phoenicians, skilled sailors, with great piles of treasure stored in their black ship. and in my father s house there was a woman from phoenicia tall and beautiful and skilled in many arts. those clever rascals tricked her. one of them first found her washing clothes beside the ship

And lay with her. sex sways all women s minds, even the best of them. and then he asked her where she was from and who she was; she showed him my father s palace, and she said,  i am from sidon, rich in bronze. i am the daughter of wealthy arybas; as i was walking back from the fields one day, some taphian pirates kidnapped me, brought me here to this man s house, and sold me to him, for a tidy sum.  her secret lover said,  then would you like

To go back home with us, and see your parents and your fine home again? they are alive and quite rich now.  the woman said,  oh, yes, i would! if all you sailors swear an oath to bring me safely home.  at that, they swore as she had asked, and made their solemn vows. and then the woman said,  you must keep mum, and none of you can even speak to me if you bump into me beside the road or at the water fountain otherwise

Someone might tell the old man at the house. then he would get suspicious, chain me up, and plan to have you killed. remember this, bear it in mind and do your trading quickly, and when your ship is full of stores to take back home with you, send news to me, and fast. i will bring gold with me as well, whatever wealth i can find to hand. i also want to give another gift to pay my fare. i take care of my master s clever son 

Who always runs around outside with me. i will bring him on board and he will fetch a pretty price from foreigners.  with that, she went back to the palace. for a year they stayed with us accumulating wealth by trading, and they filled their ship s hold up. when it was time to go, they sent a man to tell the woman at my father s house. he was a very cunning man. he wore a golden necklace strung with amber beads;

The slave girls in the palace and my mother stared and began to finger it and ask how much it cost; he nodded to the woman in silence, and then went back to the ship. she took me by the hand and led me out into the forecourt, where she found some cups left on the tables by my father s men who had been banqueting, and now had gone to council they were having a debate. she took three cups and hid them in her dress

And carried them away with her. i followed, knowing no better. as the sun went down, we hurried through the dark streets to the harbor. there was the swift phoenician ship. they all embarked, put us on board as well, and sailed over the watery waves; zeus sent fair wind. for seven days we sailed and on the eighth, artemis struck the woman with her arrows. she crashed into the ship s hold like a seagull. they threw her overboard to feed the fish

And seals, and i was left there, brokenhearted. the current carried them to ithaca, and then laertes bought me with his wealth. that was the way my eyes first saw this land.  odysseus replied,  my heart is touched to hear the story of your sufferings, eumaeus. in the end, though, zeus has blessed you, since after going through all that, you came to live with someone kind, a man who gives you plenty to eat and drink. your life is good.

But as for me, i am still lost; i trekked through many towns before i wandered here.  so went their conversation; then they slept for just a little while; dawn soon arrived upon her throne. meanwhile, telemachus drew near the mainland. lowering the sail nimbly, his men took down the mast and rowed to anchorage. they cast the mooring stones, and tied the cables from the stern, then climbed out in the surf, and waded into shore.

There they made dinner, mixing bright red wine. when they had had enough to eat and drink, the boy said sensibly,  you all should drag the ship towards the town, while i go visit the herdsmen in the fields of my estate. then i will come to town, at evening time. at dawn, i will provide a feast for you of meat and wine.  then theoclymenus asked him,  but where shall i go, my dear boy? to whose house? one of those who rule this land?

Or should i go at once to your own mother in your house?  and telemachus replied,  well, ordinarily i would invite you. we are good hosts. but as it is best not, for your own sake. i will not be at home, and mother will not see you; she is weaving upstairs upon her loom she does not want the suitors seeing her. so i suggest you go to someone else s house: the son of skillful polybus, eurymachus.

The ithacans look at him as a god. he is the dominant suitor and the keenest on marrying my mother and acquiring the riches of odysseus. zeus knows the future, he alone. eurymachus may die a dreadful death before that marriage.  as he said this, a bird flew on his right: a hawk, apollo s messenger. it clutched a pigeon in its talons; feathers scattered between the ship and young telemachus.

Then theoclymenus called him aside and grasped him by the hand, and said to him,  telemachus! some god has sent this bird to fly on your right hand. i knew at once it was a sign. no family in all of ithaca has greater power; you are the kings forever.  he replied,  oh, stranger! i hope your words come true! if so, i would give you so many gifts to show my friendship that everyone you met would be impressed. 

And then he told his faithful man,  piraeus, you were most trustworthy of those who came with me to pylos. let this stranger come to your own house, be kind to him and give him a cordial welcome till i come.  piraeus answered,  however long you are away, i will take care of him.  and then he climbed aboard and told the men to come as well, and loose the cables, which they did, and sat down on the benches. then telemachus

Tied on his sandals, and took from the deck his sharp bronze spear. the men untied the ropes and sailed towards the town, just as the son of great odysseus had ordered them. the boy walked quickly till he reached the farmyard. hundreds of pigs were there and with them slept the swineherd who knew how to help his masters.",the prince returns athena went to sparta  to ensure the safe return of prince telemachus  she found him with pisistratus  both lying on menelaus  porch  and nestor s son was fast asleep  but no sweet slumber held telemachus  his worries for his father kept him awake all through god given night  owl eyed athena stood by him and said   telemachus  you should no longer travel so far from home  abandoning your wealth   with greedy men at home  you must watch out  they

the multitude of argives  and he had two strong sons  mantius  and antiphates  who fathered the heroic o cles  whose son was amphiaraus  the warlord  whom zeus who holds the aegis and apollo adored wholeheartedly  but he did not live to old age  since he was killed at thebes  because his wife took bribes  he had two sons  amphilochus and alcmaeon  the sons  of mantius were clitus  snatched by dawn to join the gods  because he was so handsome  and polypheides  whom apollo gave the best prophetic skill of any mortal after amphiaraus had died  this prophet grew angry with his father  and migrated to hyperisia  and there he told fortunes for everyone  it was his son  named theoclymenus  who had approached telemachus while he was pouring wine  and praying to the gods  the stranger said   my friend  i find you making sacrifices  i beg you  by religion  by the gods  and by your life and your men s lives  who are you  who are your parents  what is your home town   telemachus said   stranger  i will tell you  i come from ithaca  my father is odysseus he was  he must have died some dreadful death by now  it was for him i got this ship and crew  i sailed to seek  news of my absent father   and the stranger replied   i too am far from home  i killed a man of my own tribe  and i have many brothers and kinsmen  powerful in argos  so i am on the run  they want to kill me  i have been doomed to homelessness  but please  let me on board your ship  i come to you in desperation otherwise i will surely be killed  those men are after me   telemachus said   yes  you can join us  on board our ship  and what we have is yours  you are our guest   he took the stranger s spear  laid it on deck  then climbed on board himself  sat at the stern  and had his guest sit down beside him at the stern  they loosed the ropes  telemachus gave orders to the men to seize the tackle  promptly they obeyed  and raised the wooden mast and fastened it into the socket  binding it with forestays  and hauled the white sail up with leather cables   sharp eyed athena sent fair wind that gusted a wild explosive breath through bright clear sky  the ship began to race across the sea  past crouni and the lovely streams of chalcis  the sun went down and all the world was dark  impelled by wind from zeus  the ship sped on past phaea and they came to famous elis ruled by the epeians  from there they steered towards the needle islands  still unsure if they would die  meanwhile  odysseus  was having dinner with the noble swineherd inside the cottage  and the other men were eating with them  after they were done  odysseus began to test the swineherd  to see if he would be hospitable  and ask him to stay there  out on the farm  or send him into town  he said   eumaeus  listen  and listen all of you  at dawn i plan to go to town to beg i have no wish to be a burden to you all   i only need directions and a guide who can go with me  i will roam around the city on my own  in search of drink and crusts of bread so it must be  and if i reach the house of king odysseus  i plan to tell penelope my news  and mingle with the high and mighty suitors  they may give me some food from their rich stores  i could do anything they want at once  i have the capability  you see   hermes the messenger  the god who gives favor and glorifies all human labor  has blessed me with unrivaled skill in all domestic tasks  fire laying  splitting logs  carving and roasting meat  and pouring wine  i can do all the chores poor people do to serve the rich   but angrily you said  eumaeus   no  why would you think of this  you would be killed if you set foot among that horde of suitors  their aggression reaches  the iron sky  and those who wait on them are not like you  they are young men  well dressed  with bright clean hair and handsome faces  serving the bread and wine and meat  piled high upon their polished tables  stay here  no one minds your presence not myself  nor my companions  and when odysseus  son arrives  he will provide a proper cloak and tunic  and help you travel where your heart desires   odysseus  experienced in pain   answered   i hope zeus loves you as i do  since you have saved me from the agonies of wandering  the worst thing humans suffer is homelessness  we must endure this life because of desperate hunger  we endure  as migrants with no home  but since you now want me to stay and wait for your young master  tell me about odysseus  parents  his father  when he left  was on the threshold of age  are they alive still  have they died    he answered   stranger  i will tell you truly  laertes is alive  but he is always praying to zeus to let him pass away in his own home  he feels such desperate grief about his son and his beloved wife  whose death made him so heartbroken  he aged before his time  she died a dreadful death  a death i would not wish for any friend  grieving her absent son  the famous hero  while she was still alive  despite her sadness   she used to like to talk and chat with me  she brought me up herself with her own daughter  strong  pretty ctimene  her youngest child  she raised us both together  treating me almost as equal  just a little less  and when we came of age  they sent the girl to same  for a hefty bridal price  the mother dressed me in fine clothes  a cloak and tunic  tying sandals on my feet  and sent me to the country  but she still  loved me with all her heart  i miss them both  the blessed gods have made my work here prosper  so i have had enough to eat and drink and give to guests  but i hear no good news about my mistress  ruin has befallen the house from those invaders  all her slaves miss talking to their owner  getting gossip  sharing some food and drink with her  and taking scraps to the fields with them the kind of thing that makes slaves happy   and odysseus  exclaimed   eumaeus  what a little child you were when you were taken far from home and from your parents  tell me more  did they live in a city that was sacked  or was it bandits that found you  herding sheep or cows alone  did they seize hold of you and put you onto their ship  and sell you for a profit in this man s house   the swineherd answered him   since you have asked this question  stranger  listen  enjoy my story  sitting quietly   drinking your wine  these nights are magical  with time enough to sleep and to enjoy hearing a tale  you need not sleep too early  it is unhealthy  any other man who feels the need of sleep should go lie down  get up at dawn  have breakfast  and go herd the master s pigs  but let us  you and i  sit in my cottage over food and wine  and take some joy in hearing how much pain we each have suffered  after many years  of agony and absence from one s home  a person can begin enjoying grief  i will tell you my story as you ask  there is an island you may know it called syria  where the sun turns round  above ortygia  it has few inhabitants  but it is good land  rich in sheep and wine and grain  no famine ever hurts those there  nor any deadly sickness  they grow old  and with their gentle arrows  artemis  and silver bowed apollo because their death  the land is split into two provinces  my father ctesius was king of both  then avaricious merchants came phoenicians  skilled sailors  with great piles of treasure stored in their black ship  and in my father s house there was a woman from phoenicia tall and beautiful and skilled in many arts  those clever rascals tricked her  one of them first found her washing clothes beside the ship  and lay with her  sex sways all women s minds  even the best of them  and then he asked her where she was from and who she was  she showed him my father s palace  and she said   i am from sidon  rich in bronze  i am the daughter of wealthy arybas  as i was walking back from the fields one day  some taphian pirates kidnapped me  brought me here to this man s house  and sold me to him  for a tidy sum   her secret lover said   then would you like  to go back home with us  and see your parents and your fine home again  they are alive and quite rich now   the woman said   oh  yes  i would  if all you sailors swear an oath to bring me safely home   at that  they swore as she had asked  and made their solemn vows  and then the woman said   you must keep mum  and none of you can even speak to me if you bump into me beside the road or at the water fountain otherwise  someone might tell the old man at the house  then he would get suspicious  chain me up  and plan to have you killed  remember this  bear it in mind and do your trading quickly  and when your ship is full of stores to take back home with you  send news to me  and fast  i will bring gold with me as well  whatever wealth i can find to hand  i also want to give another gift to pay my fare  i take care of my master s clever son   who always runs around outside with me  i will bring him on board and he will fetch a pretty price from foreigners   with that  she went back to the palace  for a year they stayed with us accumulating wealth by trading  and they filled their ship s hold up  when it was time to go  they sent a man to tell the woman at my father s house  he was a very cunning man  he wore a golden necklace strung with amber beads   the slave girls in the palace and my mother stared and began to finger it and ask how much it cost  he nodded to the woman in silence  and then went back to the ship  she took me by the hand and led me out into the forecourt  where she found some cups left on the tables by my father s men who had been banqueting  and now had gone to council they were having a debate  she took three cups and hid them in her dress  and carried them away with her  i followed  knowing no better  as the sun went down  we hurried through the dark streets to the harbor  there was the swift phoenician ship  they all embarked  put us on board as well  and sailed over the watery waves  zeus sent fair wind  for seven days we sailed and on the eighth  artemis struck the woman with her arrows  she crashed into the ship s hold like a seagull  they threw her overboard to feed the fish  and seals  and i was left there  brokenhearted  the current carried them to ithaca  and then laertes bought me with his wealth  that was the way my eyes first saw this land   odysseus replied   my heart is touched to hear the story of your sufferings  eumaeus  in the end  though  zeus has blessed you  since after going through all that  you came to live with someone kind  a man who gives you plenty to eat and drink  your life is good   but as for me  i am still lost  i trekked through many towns before i wandered here   so went their conversation  then they slept for just a little while  dawn soon arrived upon her throne  meanwhile  telemachus drew near the mainland  lowering the sail nimbly  his men took down the mast and rowed to anchorage  they cast the mooring stones  and tied the cables from the stern  then climbed out in the surf  and waded into shore   there they made dinner  mixing bright red wine  when they had had enough to eat and drink  the boy said sensibly   you all should drag the ship towards the town  while i go visit the herdsmen in the fields of my estate  then i will come to town  at evening time  at dawn  i will provide a feast for you of meat and wine   then theoclymenus asked him   but where shall i go  my dear boy  to whose house  one of those who rule this land   or should i go at once to your own mother in your house   and telemachus replied   well  ordinarily i would invite you  we are good hosts  but as it is best not  for your own sake  i will not be at home  and mother will not see you  she is weaving upstairs upon her loom she does not want the suitors seeing her  so i suggest you go to someone else s house  the son of skillful polybus  eurymachus   the ithacans look at him as a god  he is the dominant suitor and the keenest on marrying my mother and acquiring the riches of odysseus  zeus knows the future  he alone  eurymachus may die a dreadful death before that marriage   as he said this  a bird flew on his right  a hawk  apollo s messenger  it clutched a pigeon in its talons  feathers scattered between the ship and young telemachus   then theoclymenus called him aside and grasped him by the hand  and said to him   telemachus  some god has sent this bird to fly on your right hand  i knew at once it was a sign  no family in all of ithaca has greater power  you are the kings forever   he replied   oh  stranger  i hope your words come true  if so  i would give you so many gifts to show my friendship that everyone you met would be impressed    and then he told his faithful man   piraeus  you were most trustworthy of those who came with me to pylos  let this stranger come to your own house  be kind to him and give him a cordial welcome till i come   piraeus answered   however long you are away  i will take care of him   and then he climbed aboard and told the men to come as well  and loose the cables  which they did  and sat down on the benches  then telemachus  tied on his sandals  and took from the deck his sharp bronze spear  the men untied the ropes and sailed towards the town  just as the son of great odysseus had ordered them  the boy walked quickly till he reached the farmyard  hundreds of pigs were there and with them slept the swineherd who knew how to help his masters,23585,4455,107.04999999999986,1.8440122765738265,1.3805955811719486,1.5085449639092403,1.3521807415120857,103.54999999999987,1.8803610389572107,1.3268130651411685,1.5583998421458172,1.3191894563867534,786.803503039552,1.4729302727943216,1.0025091820307015,1.1942140418326042,1.0377610392178798,60.54336666666669,2.2727873701575745,1.747431520914181,1.8254428469062038,1.2529398944413663,205.19199999999898,1.7462136006875049,1.5810376215183795,1.465035851785439,0.8453709355062471,630.2585949280259,1.2095907480776915,0.739258980235691,0.9629189634652758,0.6670026621270101,21.516391341705305,1.7653742172989253,1.1969096455549233,1.4719389820781401,1.0156715787078492,"{'neg':

Father and son at dawn the swineherd and odysseus made breakfast, lit the fire, and sent the herdsmen out with the pigs that they had rounded up. the dogs, that as a rule would bark at strangers, were quiet when they saw telemachus; they panted at him. when odysseus saw how they acted, and heard footsteps coming, he said,  eumaeus, someone must be coming  a friend or somebody you know the dogs are friendly, with no barking. i can hear

Footsteps.  he hardly finished, when his son, his own dear son, was there inside the gate. amazed, the swineherd jumped up, letting fall the cups in which he had been mixing wine; it spilled. he ran towards his master, kissed his face and shining eyes and both his hands, and wept. just as a father, when he sees his own dear son, his only son, his dear most precious boy, returned from foreign lands after ten years of grieving for his loss,

Welcomes him; so the swineherd wrapped his arms around godlike telemachus and kissed him, as if he were returning from the dead. with tears still in his eyes he said,  sweet light! you have come back, telemachus. i thought that i would never see you anymore, after you sailed to pylos. my dear child, come in, let me enjoy the sight of you now you are back. come in! you do not often come to the countryside to see us herders;

You stay in town to watch that evil horde of suitors.  and telemachus replied warily,  grandpa, yes, i will come in. i came to see you here with my own eyes, and hear if mother still stays in the house, or if some other man has married her already, and odysseus  bed is empty, full of ugly spiderwebs.  the swineherd, the commander, said,  indeed, her heart is loyal. she is in your house,

Weeping by night and sad by day.  he took telemachus  sword; the boy came in, crossing the stony threshold, and his father offered his seat. telemachus refused, saying,  you sit there, stranger. i can find a chair around my hut. the slave can help.  odysseus went back and sat back down. the swineherd spread fresh brushwood and a fleece on top, so that telemachus could sit.

He set the bread in baskets and brought meat, left over from the meal the day before. he mixed some wine up in a wooden bowl, and sat down opposite odysseus. they reached to take the good things set before them. when they were satisfied, telemachus turned to the noble swineherd.  tell me, grandpa, where did this stranger come from? by what route did sailors bring him here? and who were they? he surely did not walk to ithaca! 

Eumaeus answered,  i will tell you, child. he is from crete. he says he wandered, lost through many towns so some god spun his fate. now he has run away from the thesprotians who brought him, and arrived here on my farm. he is all yours, your suppliant, to treat however you desire.  telemachus said anxiously,  this news of yours, eumaeus, is very worrying to me. how can i invite him to my house? i am too young

To fight back with my fists if someone picks a fight with me. my mother is unsure if she should stay with me and show respect towards her husband s bed and public gossip, and keep on taking care of things at home, or marry one of them, whichever suitor asserts himself, and brings most lavish gifts. but since this man has come here, to your house, i will dress him in fine clothes, cloak and tunic, and sandals for his feet, and give a sword,

And help him on his way. if you are willing, keep him here in the farmhouse; care for him. i will send you some clothes and all his food, so he will be no bother to these men or you. i will not let him go to meet the suitors; they are much too violent. i would be mortified if they abused him. it would be difficult for one man, even a strong one, to do anything to them. they are too many.  then odysseus,

Frustrated, said,  my friend, it is my duty to speak out when i hear the dreadful things those suitors have been doing in your house, against your will; it breaks my heart. you are a good man. tell me, did you choose to let them bully you? have the ithacans been turned against you by some god? or do you blame your brothers, who should be a man s supporters when conflict comes? if only i had youth to match my will! i wish i were the son

Of great odysseus or that i were the man himself come home from wandering. we can still hope. let someone chop my head off, if i would not destroy them when i came inside the palace of odysseus! and if i lost since i am only one against so many i would rather die in my own house, than watch such crimes committed! strangers dishonored! slave girls dragged around, raped in my lovely home! men wasting wine

And bread for nothing! for this waiting game!  telemachus said soberly,  i will explain the situation to you, stranger. the ithacans are not my enemies, and i do not have brothers i can blame. zeus gave my family a single line: arcesius had just one son, laertes, who had odysseus, his only son, and he had me, his only son, whom he left back at home; he had no joy of me.

And now there are so many cruel invaders, since all the toughest men from all the islands  from same and dulichium and wooded zacynthus, and all those who hold command in rocky ithaca, have come to court my mother, wasting all my wealth. she does not refuse the awful prospect of remarriage, nor can she end the courtship. they keep eating, consuming my whole house, and soon they may destroy me too. these things lie with the gods.

Now grandpa, you must hurry to the queen, and tell her i am safe back home from pylos. i will stay here while you tell her just her; do not let any others hear the news, since many people want to plot my death.  eumaeus, you replied,  i understand. but tell me, on this same trip, should i go and tell poor old laertes? for a while he used to watch the fields and join the slaves for dinner at the house, when in the mood,

Despite his grief for lost odysseus. but since your ship set sail away to pylos, they say he has stopped eating, will not drink, and does not go to check the fields. he sits, weeping and sobbing, worn to skin and bone.  telemachus said calmly,  that is sad; distressing news. but no, leave him alone. if human wishes could come true, my first would be to have my father come back home. take her your message, hurry back, and do not

Trail round the countryside to look for him. tell mother she should send a girl in secret to run to old laertes with the news.  at that, the swineherd tied his sandals on, and started off towards the town. athena noticed him leaving from the yard, and stood beside him as a woman, tall and skillful, and beautiful. odysseus could see her, standing beside the entrance to the cottage. telemachus could not; the gods are not

Equally visible to everyone. the dogs could see her but they did not bark. they whimpered and slunk back across the room in fear. she raised her eyebrows, with a nod; he understood and came out, past the wall, and stood beside her. then athena told him,  odysseus, great strategist, it is time for your son to know the truth; together you have to plan how you will kill the suitors. then both of you go into town. i will

Join you there soon myself; indeed i am itching to fight.  and then athena touched him, using a golden wand, and dressed him up in fine clean cloak and tunic, and she made him taller and younger-looking. he became tanned, and his cheeks filled out, and on his chin the beard grew dark. and so her work was done, and off she flew. odysseus went in. his son was startled and looked down, afraid in case it was a god. his words flew out.

 stranger, you look so different from before. your clothes, your skin i think that you must be some god who has descended from the sky. be kind to us, and we will sacrifice, and give you golden treasures. pity us!  long-suffering odysseus replied,  i am no god. why would you think such things? i am your father, that same man you mourn. it is because of me these brutal men are hurting you so badly.  then he kissed

His son and cried, tears pouring down his cheeks; he had been holding back till then. the boy did not yet trust it really was his father, and said,  no, you are not odysseus, my father; some god must have cast a spell, to cause me further pain. no mortal man could manage such a thing by his own wits, becoming old and young again unless some god appeared and did it all with ease. you certainly were old just now, and wearing

Those dirty rags. now you look like a god.  artful odysseus said sharply,  no, telemachus, you should not be surprised to see your father. it is me; no other is on his way. i am odysseus. i suffered terribly, and i was lost, but after twenty years, i have come home. as for the way i look athena did it. the goddess can transform me as she likes; sometimes a homeless beggar, then she makes me

Look like a young man, wearing princely clothes. for heavenly gods it is not difficult to make a mortal beautiful or ugly.  with that, he sat back down. telemachus hurled his arms round his father, and he wept. they both felt deep desire for lamentation, and wailed with cries as shrill as birds, like eagles or vultures, when the hunters have deprived them of fledglings who have not yet learned to fly. that was how bitterly they wept. their grieving

Would have continued till the sun went down, but suddenly telemachus said,  father, by what route did the sailors bring you here, to ithaca? and who were they? i know you did not walk.  odysseus replied,  son, i will tell you everything. phaeacians, famous for navigation, brought me here. they always help their guests travel onward. i slept as their ship sped across the ocean; they set me down on ithaca, still sleeping.

They brought me marvelous gifts of gold and bronze and clothing, which are lying in a cave, since gods have willed it so. athena told me to come here and make plans with you to kill our enemies. how many suitors are there? what kind of men are they? i am well-known for my intelligence, and i will plot to work out if we two alone can fight them, or if we might need others helping us.  telemachus considered, then said,  father,

I always heard how excellent you are, at fighting with a spear, and making plans. but what you said just now it is too much. we cannot fight, the two of us, against such strong men, and so many there are dozens, not just a handful. let me tell you quickly the number of the suitors. fifty-two came from dulichium, all top-notch fighters, who brought six henchmen. twenty-four men came from same, twenty more from zacynthus,

And from right here on ithaca came twelve, all strong young men. they have a house boy with them, named medon, and a poet, and two slaves well trained in carving meat. if we attack when all those men are crowded in the house, i am afraid you will be paying back their violence at all too high a price. think harder: can we find some kind of helper, willing to fight for us?  odysseus said,  do you think athena and her father,

Zeus, would be strong enough to keep us safe? would any other help be necessary?  telemachus replied,  the ones you mention are good defenders. they sit high among the clouds, and they control both men and gods.  the veteran odysseus replied,  those two will quickly join the heat of battle when we begin to grapple with the suitors, when in my house the god of war is testing our fighting force and theirs. go back at dawn,

And join those overconfident young men. the swineherd will escort me into town. i will again be looking like a beggar. if they abuse me and you see me suffer, you must restrain yourself, repress your feelings, even if they are pelting me with weapons, and even if they grab me by the foot to hurl me out. just watch, and keep your temper. politely tell them they should stop this folly. they will ignore you. truly now their day

Of doom is near at hand. now listen hard. athena, my best co-conspirator, will nudge my heart, and i will nod to you. then you must find all weapons in the house that could be used for fighting; go and hide them away inside the upstairs storage room. and when the suitors ask where they have gone, fob them off, saying,  they were near the fire, so i removed them from the breath of smoke, since they were getting damaged; they were losing

The luster that they used to have, before odysseus went off to troy. praise zeus! i thought of something even more important: if you get drunk you may start quarreling, and hurt each other. then your lovely dinners and courtship will be ruined. arms themselves can prompt a man to use them.  tell them that. leave out two swords, two spears, and two thick shields for you and me to grab before we rush to ambush them. athena will bewitch them,

Helped by sharp-witted zeus. and one more thing: if you are my true son, of my own blood, let no one know that i am in the house. laertes and the swineherd must not know, nor any of the slave girls, and not even penelope, until we have determined the women s attitude. we also must test the male slaves, and see who has respect and fears me in his heart, and who does not, and who looks up to you as you deserve. 

His glowing son said,  father, you will see my courage in the moment. i am tough. but it would take too long to go around and test each man like that, and all the while, the suitors would be sitting in your house, wasting your wealth with heedless partying. so reconsider. i agree you should find out about the women which of them are innocent, and which dishonor you. however, i have no desire to traipse

Around to test the men; we can do that later, if zeus reveals a sign to you.  such was their conversation. then the ship in which telemachus had gone to pylos docked in the bay of ithaca s main town. they disembarked and dragged the ship onto shore. the slaves brought out the splendid gifts and weapons and took them to the house of clytius. a messenger was sent to tell the queen telemachus was back in ithaca,

And that he said that they must come to town, dragging the ship, in case she had been weeping in her anxiety about her son. the swineherd and this messenger met up, on the same mission, to inform the queen. when both of them arrived, the slave girls clustered around the messenger. he said,  great queen, your dear son has come home!  and then the swineherd took her aside and told her what her son had ordered him to say. when he was done,

He walked out through the hall and out the courtyard, leaving the palace hall to join his pigs. the suitors were upset and down at heart. eurymachus the son of polybus said,  friends, the journey of this upstart boy succeeded! we were sure that he would fail. we must launch our best ship, equipped with rowers, to speed across the ocean to the others and tell them to come home at once.  his words were hardly finished when amphinomus

Spotted a ship inside the harbor, pointed away from land; the sails were being furled, the men were carrying the oars. he laughed triumphantly and said,  no need to send a messenger! they are already back! some god has told them, or they saw his ship approaching, but could not catch up with it.  so leaping up, they went down to the seashore, and dragged the black ship up onto dry land, and servants proudly brought the weapons out.

They all went crowding to the marketplace, together, and banned any other men from joining them, both young and old. and then antinous addressed them.  how amazing! the gods have saved this man from death! for days our scouts took turns to watch from windy cliffs. and when the sun went down, we never spent a night on shore, but sailed to wait till dawn at sea in ambush for telemachus, to make sure we would catch him. now some god

Has brought him home. we need to make new plans to murder him. he must not get away. he will obstruct our courtship if he lives, since he is wise to us, and he will plot, and now the people will be turned against us. telemachus will gather them; he must be furious, and he will not postpone action. he will stand up and tell them how we planned to murder him, but failed to do so. when they hear of our crimes, they will condemn us.

We may get hurt or driven from our land, to foreign territories; we must stop it! catch him out in the countryside, away from town, or on the road. let us rob him, and share his wealth and property among us  and let his mother, and whichever man marries her, keep the house. but if you think it would be better if we let him live, and keep his father s riches for himself, we should stop flocking here to waste the wealth

Inside his house. we should each go and court her from home, by sending gifts. one day, the lady will marry, and the lucky man will be the one who sends the most gifts.  they were silent. but then amphinomus, the famous son of nisus, spoke. he had come from the wheat fields and pastures of dulichium, with others. he was intelligent; penelope preferred his speeches over other men s. wisely he said,  my friends, i for my part

Have no desire to kill telemachus. it is a dreadful thing to kill a person of royal blood. so first we must discover the gods  intentions. if great zeus decrees it, i will kill him myself, and urge you all to join me. if the gods do not approve, i say we must not do it.  so he spoke, and they agreed with what he said. they stood, and went back to odysseus  house, and sat on polished chairs. penelope

Decided she must show herself to these ungentlemanly suitors, since she had found out about the plot to kill her son  medon had heard their plans, and he told her. her women at her side, she went downstairs, into the hall, approached them and then stopped, standing beside the doorpost with a veil across her face. she told antinous,  you are a brute! a sneak! a criminal! the people say you are the smartest boy

Of all those your own age on ithaca. it is not true. you are insane! how could you devise a plan to kill telemachus? do you have no respect for ties created by supplication, which zeus watches over? have you forgotten that your father came here, running in terror from the ithacans, who were enraged because he joined the pirates of taphos, and was hounding the thesprotians, our allies? so the ithacans were eager

To kill him, rip his heart out, and devour his wealth. odysseus protected him! now you consume your benefactor s wealth, and court his wife, and try to kill his son, and you are hurting me! i tell you, stop! and make the other suitors stop as well.  he said,  penelope, you need not worry. put all this from your mind. there is no man and never will be, who can harm your boy while i am still alive upon this earth.

I swear to you, if someone tries, my sword will spill his blood! your city-sacking husband often would take me on his lap, and give me tidbits of meat with his own hands, and sips of red wine. so telemachus is now the man i love the most in all the world. the boy is in no danger, not from us  there is no help for death brought by the gods.  he spoke to mollify her; all the while he was devising plans to kill her son.

She went up to her light and airy bedroom, and wept for dear odysseus, her husband, until athena gave her eyes sweet sleep. as evening fell, the swineherd came back home to find odysseus. he and his son had killed a year-old pig and made a meal. athena came beside odysseus and touched him with her wand again to make him ragged and old, to make sure when the swineherd came in, he would not recognize his master,

In case he told penelope the secret. he came inside. telemachus spoke first.  eumaeus, you are back! what is the news in town? are those proud suitors in my house, back from the ambush, or still lurking there to catch me on my way back home?  eumaeus answered,  i did not want to trek through town asking that question. i preferred to share my news as fast as possible and then come back. one of your own men went with me,

A messenger; he told your mother first. i saw one more thing: as i passed the hill of hermes, right above the town i saw a ship draw into harbor, full of men and loaded up with shields and spears. i thought it could be them, but i cannot be sure.  then prince telemachus began to smile and met his father s eyes; he did not let eumaeus see. when they were finished cooking, they shared the dinner equally, and all

Had plenty, then they took the gift of sleep.",father and son at dawn the swineherd and odysseus made breakfast  lit the fire  and sent the herdsmen out with the pigs that they had rounded up  the dogs  that as a rule would bark at strangers  were quiet when they saw telemachus  they panted at him  when odysseus saw how they acted  and heard footsteps coming  he said   eumaeus  someone must be coming  a friend or somebody you know the dogs are friendly  with no barking  i can hear  footsteps   he hardly finished  when his son  his own dear son  was there inside the gate  amazed  the swineherd jumped up  letting fall the cups in which he had been mixing wine  it spilled  he ran towards his master  kissed his face and shining eyes and both his hands  and wept  just as a father  when he sees his own dear son  his only son  his dear most precious boy  returned from foreign lands after ten years of grieving for his loss   welcomes him  so the swineherd wrapped his arms around godlike telemachus and kissed him  as if he were returning from the dead  with tears still in his eyes he said   sweet light  you have come back  telemachus  i thought that i would never see you anymore  after you sailed to pylos  my dear child  come in  let me enjoy the sight of you now you are back  come in  you do not often come to the countryside to see us herders   you stay in town to watch that evil horde of suitors   and telemachus replied warily   grandpa  yes  i will come in  i came to see you here with my own eyes  and hear if mother still stays in the house  or if some other man has married her already  and odysseus  bed is empty  full of ugly spiderwebs   the swineherd  the commander  said   indeed  her heart is loyal  she is in your house   weeping by night and sad by day   he took telemachus  sword  the boy came in  crossing the stony threshold  and his father offered his seat  telemachus refused  saying   you sit there  stranger  i can find a chair around my hut  the slave can help   odysseus went back and sat back down  the swineherd spread fresh brushwood and a fleece on top  so that telemachus could sit   he set the bread in baskets and brought meat  left over from the meal the day before  he mixed some wine up in a wooden bowl  and sat down opposite odysseus  they reached to take the good things set before them  when they were satisfied  telemachus turned to the noble swineherd   tell me  grandpa  where did this stranger come from  by what route did sailors bring him here  and who were they  he surely did not walk to ithaca    eumaeus answered   i will tell you  child  he is from crete  he says he wandered  lost through many towns so some god spun his fate  now he has run away from the thesprotians who brought him  and arrived here on my farm  he is all yours  your suppliant  to treat however you desire   telemachus said anxiously   this news of yours  eumaeus  is very worrying to me  how can i invite him to my house  i am too young  to fight back with my fists if someone picks a fight with me  my mother is unsure if she should stay with me and show respect towards her husband s bed and public gossip  and keep on taking care of things at home  or marry one of them  whichever suitor asserts himself  and brings most lavish gifts  but since this man has come here  to your house  i will dress him in fine clothes  cloak and tunic  and sandals for his feet  and give a sword   and help him on his way  if you are willing  keep him here in the farmhouse  care for him  i will send you some clothes and all his food  so he will be no bother to these men or you  i will not let him go to meet the suitors  they are much too violent  i would be mortified if they abused him  it would be difficult for one man  even a strong one  to do anything to them  they are too many   then odysseus   frustrated  said   my friend  it is my duty to speak out when i hear the dreadful things those suitors have been doing in your house  against your will  it breaks my heart  you are a good man  tell me  did you choose to let them bully you  have the ithacans been turned against you by some god  or do you blame your brothers  who should be a man s supporters when conflict comes  if only i had youth to match my will  i wish i were the son  of great odysseus or that i were the man himself come home from wandering  we can still hope  let someone chop my head off  if i would not destroy them when i came inside the palace of odysseus  and if i lost since i am only one against so many i would rather die in my own house  than watch such crimes committed  strangers dishonored  slave girls dragged around  raped in my lovely home  men wasting wine  and bread for nothing  for this waiting game   telemachus said soberly   i will explain the situation to you  stranger  the ithacans are not my enemies  and i do not have brothers i can blame  zeus gave my family a single line  arcesius had just one son  laertes  who had odysseus  his only son  and he had me  his only son  whom he left back at home  he had no joy of me   and now there are so many cruel invaders  since all the toughest men from all the islands  from same and dulichium and wooded zacynthus  and all those who hold command in rocky ithaca  have come to court my mother  wasting all my wealth  she does not refuse the awful prospect of remarriage  nor can she end the courtship  they keep eating  consuming my whole house  and soon they may destroy me too  these things lie with the gods   now grandpa  you must hurry to the queen  and tell her i am safe back home from pylos  i will stay here while you tell her just her  do not let any others hear the news  since many people want to plot my death   eumaeus  you replied   i understand  but tell me  on this same trip  should i go and tell poor old laertes  for a while he used to watch the fields and join the slaves for dinner at the house  when in the mood   despite his grief for lost odysseus  but since your ship set sail away to pylos  they say he has stopped eating  will not drink  and does not go to check the fields  he sits  weeping and sobbing  worn to skin and bone   telemachus said calmly   that is sad  distressing news  but no  leave him alone  if human wishes could come true  my first would be to have my father come back home  take her your message  hurry back  and do not  trail round the countryside to look for him  tell mother she should send a girl in secret to run to old laertes with the news   at that  the swineherd tied his sandals on  and started off towards the town  athena noticed him leaving from the yard  and stood beside him as a woman  tall and skillful  and beautiful  odysseus could see her  standing beside the entrance to the cottage  telemachus could not  the gods are not  equally visible to everyone  the dogs could see her but they did not bark  they whimpered and slunk back across the room in fear  she raised her eyebrows  with a nod  he understood and came out  past the wall  and stood beside her  then athena told him   odysseus  great strategist  it is time for your son to know the truth  together you have to plan how you will kill the suitors  then both of you go into town  i will  join you there soon myself  indeed i am itching to fight   and then athena touched him  using a golden wand  and dressed him up in fine clean cloak and tunic  and she made him taller and younger looking  he became tanned  and his cheeks filled out  and on his chin the beard grew dark  and so her work was done  and off she flew  odysseus went in  his son was startled and looked down  afraid in case it was a god  his words flew out    stranger  you look so different from before  your clothes  your skin i think that you must be some god who has descended from the sky  be kind to us  and we will sacrifice  and give you golden treasures  pity us   long suffering odysseus replied   i am no god  why would you think such things  i am your father  that same man you mourn  it is because of me these brutal men are hurting you so badly   then he kissed  his son and cried  tears pouring down his cheeks  he had been holding back till then  the boy did not yet trust it really was his father  and said   no  you are not odysseus  my father  some god must have cast a spell  to because me further pain  no mortal man could manage such a thing by his own wits  becoming old and young again unless some god appeared and did it all with ease  you certainly were old just now  and wearing  those dirty rags  now you look like a god   artful odysseus said sharply   no  telemachus  you should not be surprised to see your father  it is me  no other is on his way  i am odysseus  i suffered terribly  and i was lost  but after twenty years  i have come home  as for the way i look athena did it  the goddess can transform me as she likes  sometimes a homeless beggar  then she makes me  look like a young man  wearing princely clothes  for heavenly gods it is not difficult to make a mortal beautiful or ugly   with that  he sat back down  telemachus hurled his arms round his father  and he wept  they both felt deep desire for lamentation  and wailed with cries as shrill as birds  like eagles or vultures  when the hunters have deprived them of fledglings who have not yet learned to fly  that was how bitterly they wept  their grieving  would have continued till the sun went down  but suddenly telemachus said   father  by what route did the sailors bring you here  to ithaca  and who were they  i know you did not walk   odysseus replied   son  i will tell you everything  phaeacians  famous for navigation  brought me here  they always help their guests travel onward  i slept as their ship sped across the ocean  they set me down on ithaca  still sleeping   they brought me marvelous gifts of gold and bronze and clothing  which are lying in a cave  since gods have willed it so  athena told me to come here and make plans with you to kill our enemies  how many suitors are there  what kind of men are they  i am well known for my intelligence  and i will plot to work out if we two alone can fight them  or if we might need others helping us   telemachus considered  then said   father   i always heard how excellent you are  at fighting with a spear  and making plans  but what you said just now it is too much  we cannot fight  the two of us  against such strong men  and so many there are dozens  not just a handful  let me tell you quickly the number of the suitors  fifty two came from dulichium  all top notch fighters  who brought six henchmen  twenty four men came from same  twenty more from zacynthus   and from right here on ithaca came twelve  all strong young men  they have a house boy with them  named medon  and a poet  and two slaves well trained in carving meat  if we attack when all those men are crowded in the house  i am afraid you will be paying back their violence at all too high a price  think harder  can we find some kind of helper  willing to fight for us   odysseus said   do you think athena and her father   zeus  would be strong enough to keep us safe  would any other help be necessary   telemachus replied   the ones you mention are good defenders  they sit high among the clouds  and they control both men and gods   the veteran odysseus replied   those two will quickly join the heat of battle when we begin to grapple with the suitors  when in my house the god of war is testing our fighting force and theirs  go back at dawn   and join those overconfident young men  the swineherd will escort me into town  i will again be looking like a beggar  if they abuse me and you see me suffer  you must restrain yourself  repress your feelings  even if they are pelting me with weapons  and even if they grab me by the foot to hurl me out  just watch  and keep your temper  politely tell them they should stop this folly  they will ignore you  truly now their day  of doom is near at hand  now listen hard  athena  my best co conspirator  will nudge my heart  and i will nod to you  then you must find all weapons in the house that could be used for fighting  go and hide them away inside the upstairs storage room  and when the suitors ask where they have gone  fob them off  saying   they were near the fire  so i removed them from the breath of smoke  since they were getting damaged  they were losing  the luster that they used to have  before odysseus went off to troy  praise zeus  i thought of something even more important  if you get drunk you may start quarreling  and hurt each other  then your lovely dinners and courtship will be ruined  arms themselves can prompt a man to use them   tell them that  leave out two swords  two spears  and two thick shields for you and me to grab before we rush to ambush them  athena will bewitch them   helped by sharp witted zeus  and one more thing  if you are my true son  of my own blood  let no one know that i am in the house  laertes and the swineherd must not know  nor any of the slave girls  and not even penelope  until we have determined the women s attitude  we also must test the male slaves  and see who has respect and fears me in his heart  and who does not  and who looks up to you as you deserve    his glowing son said   father  you will see my courage in the moment  i am tough  but it would take too long to go around and test each man like that  and all the while  the suitors would be sitting in your house  wasting your wealth with heedless partying  so reconsider  i agree you should find out about the women which of them are innocent  and which dishonor you  however  i have no desire to traipse  around to test the men  we can do that later  if zeus reveals a sign to you   such was their conversation  then the ship in which telemachus had gone to pylos docked in the bay of ithaca s main town  they disembarked and dragged the ship onto shore  the slaves brought out the splendid gifts and weapons and took them to the house of clytius  a messenger was sent to tell the queen telemachus was back in ithaca   and that he said that they must come to town  dragging the ship  in case she had been weeping in her anxiety about her son  the swineherd and this messenger met up  on the same mission  to inform the queen  when both of them arrived  the slave girls clustered around the messenger  he said   great queen  your dear son has come home   and then the swineherd took her aside and told her what her son had ordered him to say  when he was done   he walked out through the hall and out the courtyard  leaving the palace hall to join his pigs  the suitors were upset and down at heart  eurymachus the son of polybus said   friends  the journey of this upstart boy succeeded  we were sure that he would fail  we must launch our best ship  equipped with rowers  to speed across the ocean to the others and tell them to come home at once   his words were hardly finished when amphinomus  spotted a ship inside the

one day  the lady will marry  and the lucky man will be the one who sends the most gifts   they were silent  but then amphinomus  the famous son of nisus  spoke  he had come from the wheat fields and

stop  and make the other suitors stop as well   he said   penelope  you need not worry  put all this from your mind  there is no man and never will be  who can harm your boy while i am still alive upon this earth   i swear to you  if someone tries  my sword will spill his blood  your city sacking husband often would take me on his lap  and give me tidbits of meat with his own hands  and sips of

swineherd came in  he would not recognize his master   in case he told penelope the secret  he came inside  telemachus spoke first   eumaeus  you are back  what is the news in town  are those proud

Insults and abuse when newborn dawn appeared with hands of flowers, telemachus, odysseus  son, fastened his handsome sandals on his feet, took up his sturdy spear that fit his hand, and headed out. he told the swineherd,  grandpa, i must go into town, to see my mother. until we meet, i think she will not stop her lamentations, tears, and bitter sobbing. now i need you to take this poor old stranger to town to beg his supper; any man

Who feels like it can feed him. i cannot put up with everyone right now; i have too many worries. if he gets annoyed, the worse for him. i always like to tell the honest truth.  odysseus replied,  my friend, i do not even want to stay. beggars should wander round the town and country. i will get food from charitable people. i am too old to stay here as a farmhand, obeying orders from an overseer.

This man will take me, as you told him to, as soon as i have warmed up by the fire. i only have these rags; the morning frost may do me in you say the town is far.  at that, telemachus strode quickly out, thinking about his plan to hurt the suitors. and when he reached the royal house, he propped his spear against a pillar, and went in, across the stony threshold. eurycleia the nurse, was first to notice his arrival,

As she was laying fleeces on the chairs. weeping, she rushed at him. the other women owned by strong-willed odysseus assembled and kissed telemachus  head and shoulders to welcome him. then wise penelope came from her bedroom, looking like a goddess, like artemis or golden aphrodite, and flung her arms around her darling son, and wept. she kissed his face and shining eyes, and through her tears her words flew out.  you came!

Telemachus! sweet light! i was so sure that i would never see you anymore after you sailed to pylos secretly, not telling me, to get news of your father. tell me, what have you seen?  telemachus said calmly,  mother, do not try to make me upset, or stir my feelings. i survived the danger. go upstairs and take your bath, put on clean clothes and take your women with you into your bedroom. sacrifice and pray

To all the gods, that one day zeus may grant revenge. now i am going into town. i will invite the stranger who arrived right after me on ithaca. i sent him ahead, with my brave men, and told piraeus to take him home and treat him with all kindness until i come.  his flying words hit home. she washed, put on clean clothes, and prayed to all the gods, and made them lavish sacrifices, asking that one day zeus would bring revenge.

Telemachus took up his spear and marched out through the hall, two swift dogs at his side. athena poured unearthly grace upon him. everyone was amazed to see him coming. the suitors gathered round and spoke to him in friendly tones; at heart, they meant him harm. keeping away from most of them, he joined mentor and antiphus and halitherses, who were his father s friends from long ago. they questioned him in detail. then piraeus

Approached with theoclymenus, the stranger whom he had brought through town towards the center. at once telemachus set out and rushed to stand beside the stranger. and piraeus spoke first.  telemachus, send women quickly to my house, so i may give back the gifts that menelaus gave you.  but with caution telemachus replied,  piraeus, no. we do not know exactly what will happen, and if the suitors in my house by stealth

Should kill me and divide my father s wealth between themselves, i would prefer that you enjoy the gifts than any of those men. and if i kill them, planting doom among them, bring me the gifts, and we will both be happy.  with this, he led the weary stranger back to his house, where he laid their cloaks across chairs; they went to bathe. the slave girls washed them, rubbed them with oil, and dressed them in wool cloaks and tunics. then they left the baths and sat

On chairs. a girl brought out a golden pitcher and poured the washing water on their hands, over a silver bowl. she set a table beside them, and a humble slave girl brought a generous array from their rich stores. penelope was leaning on a chair beside the door, facing telemachus, spinning fine strands of wool. they helped themselves to food and drink. when they had had enough, penelope, preoccupied, spoke up.

 telemachus, i will go upstairs now, to lie down on my bed, which has become a bed of mourning, always stained with tears, since my odysseus went off to troy with those two sons of atreus. but you have failed to tell me if you gathered news about your father s journey home; now tell me, before the suitors come.  telemachus answered her calmly.  mother, i will tell you. we went to pylos, visiting king nestor.

He made me very welcome in his palace, under his roof, as if i were his son returning after many years away. he cared for me like one of his own sons. but he said he had not heard anything from anyone about odysseus, alive or dead. he sent me on, with horses and carriage, to the son of atreus, great general menelaus. there i saw helen for whose sake, by the will of gods,

The greeks and trojans suffered through the war. when menelaus asked why i had come to glorious sparta, i told him the truth in detail, and he answered,  stupid cowards! the bed they want to lie down in belongs to someone truly resolute. as when a deer lays down her newborn suckling fawns inside the leafy den of some fierce lion, and goes off to the slopes and grassy valleys to graze. then he comes back to his own bed

And cruelly destroys both little ones. so will odysseus destroy them all. by father zeus, athena, and apollo, i pray he is as strong as long ago, on lesbos, when he wrestled philomedes and hurled him to the ground, and all the greeks cheered. may he fight the suitors that same way, so all of them will find their courtship ends badly, and their lives soon. and i will answer your questions frankly, and tell what i learned

From the old sea god, who can tell no lies. he said he saw him in distress: the nymph calypso has him trapped upon her island, inside her house. he cannot come back home to his own country, since he has no fleet or crew to row across the sea s broad back.  that was what famous menelaus said. my tasks accomplished, i sailed off. the gods gave me fair wind which swiftly brought me home.  his story stirred emotions in her heart.

Then godlike theoclymenus spoke up.  my lady, wife of great odysseus, this news is incomplete. i will reveal the whole truth with a prophecy. i swear by zeus and hospitality and by the hearth of great odysseus, the place where i have come: he is already here in ithaca at rest or on his way. he must have learned what bad things they are doing, and he is plotting ruin for them all.

I know because i saw a sign while sitting on board the ship i told telemachus.  penelope said carefully,  well, stranger, i hope this does come true. i would reward you with so much warmth and generosity that everyone you met would see your luck.  meanwhile, outside odysseus  house, the suitors relished games of darts and discus, playing outside as usual, with no thought of others. then at dinnertime, when flocks

Of sheep were trekking home from every field, led by their shepherds, medon spoke. he was the suitors  favorite slave boy, whom they always brought to their feasts.  my lords, you have enjoyed your games. now come inside to eat. there is no harm in having meals at proper times.  they followed his advice, stood up and went inside the palace. they spread out their cloaks over the chairs, and killed plump goats, large rams, some fatted pigs, and one domestic cow,

And cooked them for the feast. odysseus was making haste to leave the countryside for town. the swineherd spoke in lordly tones.  stranger, my master says that you can come to town today, as you desire though i would rather leave you here to watch the farm. but i am nervous that the master may reproach me, and a master s curses fall heavily on a slave. now we must go. the hour is late and it will soon get colder;

The sun is sinking low.  odysseus answered,  i understand. we can go now; you lead the way. but if you have a stick, give it to me to lean on, since i hear the path is slippery.  with that, he slung his bag across his shoulders by its string. it was all tattered, full of holes. eumaeus gave him a serviceable stick. they left; the dogs and herdsmen stayed to guard the farm. the swineherd led his master into town

Resembling a poor old beggar, leaning upon a stick and dressed in dirty rags. they walked along the stony path, and near the town, they reached an ornate fountain, flowing with clear streams, where the people came for water. it had been built by ithacus, neritus, and polyctor. a circle of black poplars grew round it, nurtured by the spring. cool water poured from the rocks above. there was an altar built over it in honor of the nymphs.

All passersby made offerings to them. melanthius the son of dolius, with two more herders, met them there. he was driving the finest goats to feed the suitors. on seeing them, he spoke abusively, in brash, offensive language that enraged odysseus.  one scoundrel leads another! makes sense: gods join like things with like. you foul pig-man, where are you taking this old swine? a scrounger, who will rub on many doors,

Demanding scraps, not gifts for warriors. if you let me have him to guard my farm, and muck the pens and toss the kids their fodder, he could drink whey and fatten his stick legs. but he does not want work. he likes to traipse around the town and beg for chow to stuff his greedy belly. i predict, if he reaches the palace of odysseus, a mass of hands will hurl stools at his head, to pelt him through the house and bruise his ribs. 

With that, he sauntered past him, and lunged out to kick him on the hip bone. what a fool! odysseus was not pushed off the path; he stood there fixed in place, and wondered whether to rush at him, armed with his stick, and kill him, or grab him by the ears and push him down onto the ground. instead, he braced himself and kept his temper. when the swineherd saw melanthius insulting him, he prayed, arms high.  o fountain nymphs, o zeus  daughters!

If ever king odysseus brought bones of lamb and goat in luscious fat for you, then now fulfill my prayer! may spirits guide him home! my master will put paid to all the bluster of this rude man, who loafs round town and lets the animals be ruined by bad herders.  melanthius the goatherd sneered at him,  oh, very nice! this dog knows how to talk, and it has learned some tricks. one day i will take him by ship and row him far away

From ithaca, and get a heap of treasure by selling him. i wish apollo would shoot silver arrows at telemachus tomorrow in his house; or that the suitors would kill him. i am sure odysseus is far away and never coming back.  with that, he left them they were walking slowly, and he rushed on ahead of them. he went inside his master s house, and sat among the suitors, with eurymachus, his favorite.

The slaves brought out a piece of meat for him, and a submissive house girl brought him bread. the swineherd and odysseus went in, and stood, surrounded by the strumming sound of the resounding lyre that phemius was tuning for his song. odysseus grabbed at the swineherd s hand and said,  eumaeus! this is odysseus  splendid palace. it could be recognized among a thousand. the rooms are all connected, and the courtyard

Is fenced in by a wall with cornices, and there are sturdy double doors. no man could break through here. i notice many men are feasting; i smell meat, and hear the lyre, which gods have made companion to the feast.  eumaeus answered,  right! you are perceptive. now we must plan. will you go inside first to join the suitors, while i stay out here? or do you want to wait, and i will go? but do not stay too long. if someone sees you,

You will be pelted, maybe beaten up.  unflappable odysseus said,  yes, i thought of that. you go, i will stay here. i have been hit before. i know hard knocks. i am resilient. i suffered war and being lost at sea. so let this be. there is no way to hide a hungry belly. it is insistent, and the curse of hunger is why we sail across relentless seas, and plunder other people.  as they spoke,

Argos, the dog that lay there, raised his head and ears. odysseus had trained this dog but with no benefit he left too soon to march on holy troy. the master gone, boys took the puppy out to hunt wild goats and deer and hares. but now he lay neglected, without an owner, in a pile of dung from mules and cows the slaves stored heaps of it outside the door, until they fertilized the large estate. so argos lay there dirty,

Covered with fleas. and when he realized odysseus was near, he wagged his tail, and both his ears dropped back. he was too weak to move towards his master. at a distance, odysseus had noticed, and he wiped his tears away and hid them easily, and said,  eumaeus, it is strange this dog is lying in the dung; he looks quite handsome, though it is hard to tell if he can run, or if he is a pet, a table dog,

Kept just for looks.  eumaeus, you replied,  this dog belonged to someone who has died in foreign lands. if he were in good health, as when odysseus abandoned him and went to troy, you soon would see how quick and brave he used to be. he went to hunt in woodland, and he always caught his prey. his nose was marvelous. but now he is in bad condition, with his master gone, long dead. the women fail to care for him.

Slaves do not want to do their proper work, when masters are not watching them. zeus halves our value on the day that makes us slaves.  with that, the swineherd went inside the palace, to join the noble suitors. twenty years had passed since argos saw odysseus, and now he saw him for the final time  then suddenly, black death took hold of him. telemachus first saw the swineherd coming. he gave a nod to tell him to come over.

Glancing around, eumaeus saw the stool used by the boy who carved the suitors  meat. he picked it up and set it down beside telemachus  table. there he sat; the slave boy brought him meat and bread. and then odysseus approached and stepped inside, looking like some poor homeless sad old man; he hobbled on his stick, then slumped himself down on the ash-wood threshold, leaning back against the cypress doorpost, which a workman

Had smoothed and straightened long ago. the boy summoned the swineherd over, and picked up a wheat loaf from the basket and as much meat as his hands could hold, and gave it to him. he said,  please take this food out to that stranger, and tell him he should walk around the hall and beg from all the suitors; shame is not a friend to those in need.  the swineherd went and told odysseus,  telemachus gives you this food and says you ought to beg

From all these suitors; shame, he says, is not fitting for those who have to live by handouts.  odysseus prayed cautiously,  o zeus, bless this telemachus, and may he have all that his heart desires.  and with both hands he took the food and set it at his feet, on top of his old ragged bag, and ate, and listened to the singer in the hall. as he was finishing, the music stopped; the suitors shouted, and athena stood

Beside odysseus, and prompted him to go among the suitors, begging scraps, to find out which of them were bad or good  although she had no thought of saving any out of the massacre which was to come. he went around and begged from left to right, holding his hand out, like a practiced beggar. they gave him food in pity, and they wondered who this man was and whereabouts he came from. they asked each other, and melanthius,

The goatherd, said,  you suitors of the queen, listen to me about this stranger here. i saw this man before; the swineherd brought him. i know no more; i do not know his background.  antinous began to scold the swineherd.  pig-man! you famous idiot! why did you bring this man here? do we not have already plenty of homeless people coming here to spoil our feasts? is it not bad enough that they crowd round and eat your master s wealth?

You had to ask this other one as well?  eumaeus, you replied,  antinous, you are a lord, but what you say is trash. who would invite a stranger from abroad unless he had the skills to help the people  a prophet, or a doctor, or a builder, or poet who can sing and bring delight? no one would ask a beggar; they bring only their hunger. out of all the suitors, you are meanest to the slaves, especially me.

But if the prudent queen and godlike prince still live here in this house, i do not mind.  telemachus said,  shush. antinous does not deserve an answer. he is always picking a fight, and goading on the others.  then turning to antinous, he said,  you care for me so nicely, like a father! you told me i should force the stranger out. may no god make that happen! go to him and give him something; i can spare the food.

Go on, i tell you! you should pay no heed to mother or the other household slaves belonging to my father. you were not concerned about them anyway. you want to gorge yourself, not share with other people.  antinous replied,  you little show-off! what nasty temper! what an awful comment! if all the suitors gave the same as me, this house could keep him checked for three whole months.  he had a footstool underneath the table,

For resting his soft feet on while he feasted; he brandished it. the others all gave food and filled the beggar s bag. odysseus had finished with his test; he could have walked back to the threshold, no harm done. instead, he stood beside antinous and said,  friend, give me something. you must be the best of all the greeks. you look like royalty, so you should give more food than all the rest, and i will make you known throughout the world.

I used to be a rich man, with a palace. when needy beggars came from anywhere, no matter who they were, i gave them food. my slaves were numberless, my wealth was great; i had the life men say is happiness. but zeus destroyed it all; he wanted to. he prompted me to travel with some pirates to egypt; that long journey spelled my ruin. i moored my galleys in the river nile and told my loyal men to stay and guard them,

And sent out scouts to all the lookout points. but they were too impulsive, and they sacked the beautiful egyptian fields, and seized women and children, and they killed the men. the screaming reached the town; the people heard, and rushed to come and help; at dawn the plain was all filled up with foot soldiers and horses and flashing bronze. then zeus, who loves the thunder, caused panic in my men disastrous panic. danger was all around us, and not one

Stood firm. the sharp bronze swords killed many men, and others were enslaved as laborers. but they gave me to somebody they met, a foreigner named dmetor, king of cyprus. i came from there. such is my tale of woe.  antinous replied,  what god imposed this pest to spoil our feast? stay over there, not near my table or you can get lost! get killed in egypt or enslaved in cyprus! you barefaced beggar! you come up to us,

And these men give you treats unthinkingly; we have so much, and people do not mind sharing another person s wealth.  sharp-witted odysseus drew back from him and said,  you handsome idiot! you would not give a grain of salt from your own house. you sit enjoying someone else s food, and yet you will not give a crumb from this great banquet to me.  antinous was furious, and scowling said,  that does it! you insult me?

You lost the chance to leave with dignity!  he lifted up his stool and hurled it at odysseus  right shoulder, near his back. it did not knock him over; like a rock he stood there, shook his head, and silently considered his revenge. then he went back, sat on the threshold and set down the bag, all full of food, and told them,  listen, suitors of this world-famous queen; i have to speak. when men are fighting for their own possessions,

For cows or sheep, there is no shame in wounds. but now antinous has wounded me because i came here hungry; hunger brings such suffering to humans. if there are gods of the poor, or furies to avenge us, may he be struck by death, instead of marriage! he answered,  stranger, shut up, or be off! if you keep talking, we young men will drag you across the palace by your hands and feet and have you flayed alive!  but all the others

Reproached antinous insistently.  you ought not to have hit a poor old beggar! if he turns out to be a god from heaven it will end badly! gods disguise themselves as foreigners and strangers to a town, to see who violates their holy laws, and who is good.  antinous ignored the suitors  words. the blow increased the pain inside telemachus  heart, but he let fall no tears. he calmly shook his head

And thought about revenge. penelope heard what had happened in the hall, and said to all her slaves,  i hope apollo shoots antinous, just as he hit the beggar!  and old eurynome replied,  if only our prayers were answered! none of them would live to see the dawn ride in upon her throne.  penelope said,  yes, dear, they are all our enemies and mean to do us harm. antinous is the worst; he is like death.

Some poor old stranger wandered to this house and asked the men for food, compelled by need. the others helped him out and filled his bag; antinous hurled a footstool at his shoulder.  she had this conversation in her room with her attendants, while odysseus was eating dinner. then she called the swineherd.  eumaeus! have the stranger come to me, so i may welcome him, and ask if he has heard or witnessed anything about

Long-lost odysseus. the stranger seems as if he must have traveled far.  eumaeus replied,  your majesty, i wish these men would quiet down! the tales the stranger tells would charm your heart. for three days and three nights i had him stay with me. he ran away from off a ship, and came to my house first; he started to describe his sufferings, and had not finished. like a singer, blessed by gods with skill in storytelling people

Watch him and hope that he will sing forever  so this man s tale enchanted me. he says odysseus and he are old guest-friends through their forefathers. this man lived in crete, the home of minos, and he traveled here a rambling route, with dangers compassed round. he says odysseus is still alive and near here, in the rich thesprotian land, and he is bringing home a pile of treasure.  penelope said,  call him over, let him

Tell me in person, while the suitors have their fun here in my house or at the doors; their mood is festive. in their homes they have untasted food and wine, which their house slaves devour, while they are flocking to our house each day to slaughter oxen, sheep, and goats, to feast and drink our wine, with no restraint. our wealth is decimated. there is no man here like odysseus, who could defend the house. but if odysseus comes back

To his own native land, he and his son will soon take vengeance for their violence.  telemachus sneezed loudly and the noise resounded through the hall. penelope laughed, and she told eumaeus,  call the stranger! my son just sneezed at what i said you heard? it is a sign of death for all the suitors; no one can save them from their ruin now. but listen: if i find this stranger speaking the truth, give him nice clothes a cloak and tunic. 

At that, the swineherd went and stood beside odysseus. his words had wings.  now sir, penelope, telemachus  mother, has summoned you. she feels impelled to ask about her husband, painful though it is. if you tell her the truth and she will know  you will get clothes; you desperately need them. and you can ask for food all through the town, and fill your belly. anyone who wants can give you scraps.  strong-willed odysseus

Answered,  eumaeus, i will tell the truth, the whole truth, to penelope, and soon. i know about odysseus; we shared in suffering. but i am very nervous about the rowdy suitors. their aggression touches the iron sky. when i was walking across the hall just now, quite harmlessly, that man hurled something at me, and he hurt me. telemachus did nothing to protect me, and nor did anybody else. so now,

Tell her to stay right there until night falls, however eager she may be. at dusk, she can come nearer, sit beside the fire, and ask about her husband s journey home. i do have dirty clothes you know it well, since it was you i came to first for help.  the swineherd headed back; he crossed the threshold, and sharp penelope said,  are you not bringing the traveler? is something wrong? is he too scared or shy? a homeless man

Can ill afford such shame.  eumaeus answered,  his words were common sense; he wants to stay out of the suitors  way; they are aggressive. he says you should stay here until sunset. it is much better for you too, my queen, to speak to him alone.  penelope replied,  the stranger is no fool at least. there never were such bullies as these men, and they intend us harm.  the swineherd went back to the crowd of suitors, and approached

Telemachus, and tucked his head down close, so no one else would hear.  my friend,  he said,  i have to go and watch the pigs, and all your property, and mine. you should take care of everything, but most of all, yourself. do not get hurt. so many mean you harm. i pray that zeus obliterates them all, before they injure us!  telemachus answered,  may it be so. first eat, then go; come back at dawn with animals for meat.

The rest is up to me and up to gods.  so then eumaeus sat down on the stool, and ate and drank, then went back to his pigs, leaving the palace full of banqueters. it was already late, past afternoon; music and dancing entertained the suitors.",insults and abuse when newborn dawn appeared with hands of flowers  telemachus  odysseus  son  fastened his handsome sandals on his feet  took up his sturdy spear that fit his hand  and headed out  he told the swineherd   grandpa  i must go into town  to see my mother  until we meet  i think she will not stop her lamentations  tears  and bitter sobbing  now i need you to take this poor old stranger to town to beg his supper  any man  who feels like it can feed him  i cannot put up with everyone right now  i have too many worries  if he gets annoyed  the worse for him  i always like to tell the honest truth   odysseus replied   my friend  i do not even want to stay  beggars should wander round the town and country  i will get food from charitable people  i am too old to stay here as a farmhand  obeying orders from an overseer   this man will take me  as you told him to  as soon as i have warmed up by the fire  i only have these rags  the morning frost may do me in you say the town is far   at that  telemachus strode quickly out  thinking about his plan to hurt the suitors  and when he reached the royal house  he propped his spear against a pillar  and went in  across the stony threshold  eurycleia the nurse  was first to notice his arrival   as she was laying fleeces on the chairs  weeping  she rushed at him  the other women

stick and dressed in dirty rags  they walked along the stony path  and near the town  they reached an ornate fountain  flowing with clear streams  where the people came for water  it had been built by ithacus  neritus  and polyctor  a circle of black poplars grew round it  nurtured by the spring  cool water poured from the rocks above  there was an altar built over it in honor of the nymphs   all passersby made offerings to them  melanthius the son of dolius  with two more herders  met them there  he was driving the finest goats to feed the suitors  on seeing them  he spoke abusively  in brash  offensive language that enraged odysseus   one scoundrel leads another  makes sense  gods join like things with like  you foul pig man  where are you taking this old swine  a scrounger  who will rub on many doors   demanding scraps  not gifts for warriors  if you let me have him to guard my farm  and muck the pens and toss the kids their fodder  he could drink whey and fatten his stick legs  but he does not want work  he likes to traipse around the town and beg for chow to stuff his greedy belly  i predict  if he reaches the palace of odysseus  a mass of hands will hurl stools at his head  to pelt him through the house and bruise his ribs    with that  he sauntered past him  and lunged out to kick him on the hip bone  what a fool  odysseus was not pushed off the path  he stood there fixed in place  and wondered whether to rush at him  armed with his stick  and kill him  or grab him by the ears and push him down onto the ground  instead  he braced himself and kept his temper  when the swineherd saw melanthius insulting him  he prayed  arms high   o fountain nymphs  o zeus  daughters   if ever king odysseus brought bones of lamb and goat in luscious fat for you  then now fulfill my prayer  may spirits guide him home  my master will put paid to all the bluster of this rude man  who loafs round town and let us the animals be ruined by bad herders   melanthius the goatherd sneered at him   oh  very nice  this dog knows how to talk  and it has learned some tricks  one day i will take him by ship and row him far away  from ithaca  and get a heap of treasure by selling him  i wish apollo would shoot silver arrows at telemachus tomorrow in his house  or that the suitors would kill him  i am sure odysseus is far away and never coming back   with that  he left them they were walking slowly  and he rushed on ahead of them  he went inside his master s house  and sat among the suitors  with eurymachus  his favorite   the slaves brought out a piece of meat for him  and a submissive house girl brought him bread  the swineherd and odysseus went in  and stood  surrounded by the strumming sound of the resounding lyre that phemius was tuning for his song  odysseus grabbed at the swineherd s hand and said   eumaeus  this is odysseus  splendid palace  it could be recognized among a thousand  the rooms are all connected  and the courtyard  is fenced in by a wall with cornices  and there are sturdy double doors  no man could break through here  i notice many men are feasting  i smell meat  and hear the lyre  which gods have made companion to the feast   eumaeus answered   right  you are perceptive  now we must plan  will you go inside first to join the suitors  while i stay out here  or do you want to wait  and i will go  but do not stay too long  if someone sees you   you will be pelted  maybe beaten up   unflappable odysseus said   yes  i thought of that  you go  i will stay here  i have been hit before  i know hard knocks  i am resilient  i suffered war and being lost at sea  so let this be  there is no way to hide a hungry belly  it is insistent  and the curse of hunger is why we sail across relentless seas  and plunder other people   as they spoke   argos  the dog that lay there  raised his head and ears  odysseus had trained this dog but with no benefit he left too soon to march on holy troy  the master gone  boys took the puppy out to hunt wild goats and deer and hares  but now he lay neglected  without an owner  in a pile of dung from mules and cows the slaves stored heaps of it outside the door  until they fertilized the large estate  so argos lay there dirty   covered with fleas  and when he realized odysseus was near  he wagged his tail  and both his ears dropped back  he was too weak to move towards his master  at a distance  odysseus had noticed  and he wiped his tears away and hid them easily  and said   eumaeus  it is strange this dog is lying in the dung  he looks quite handsome  though it is hard to tell if he can run  or if he is a pet  a table dog   kept just for looks   eumaeus  you replied   this dog belonged to someone who has died in foreign lands  if he were in good health  as when odysseus abandoned him and went to troy  you soon would see how quick and brave he used to be  he went to hunt in woodland  and he always caught his prey  his nose was marvelous  but now he is in bad condition  with his master gone  long dead  the women fail to care for him   slaves do not want to do their proper work  when masters are not watching them  zeus halves our value on the day that makes us slaves   with that  the swineherd went inside the palace  to join the noble suitors  twenty years had passed since argos saw odysseus  and now he saw him for the final time  then suddenly  black death took hold of him  telemachus first saw the swineherd coming  he gave a nod to tell him to come over   glancing around  eumaeus saw the stool used by the boy who carved the suitors  meat  he picked it up and set it down beside telemachus  table  there he sat  the slave boy brought him meat and bread  and then odysseus approached and stepped inside  looking like some poor homeless sad old man  he hobbled on his stick  then slumped himself down on the ash wood threshold  leaning back against the cypress doorpost  which a workman  had smoothed and straightened long ago  the boy summoned the swineherd over  and picked up a wheat loaf from the basket and as much meat as his hands could hold  and gave it to him  he said   please take this food out to that stranger  and tell him he should walk around the hall and beg from all the suitors  shame is not a friend to those in need   the swineherd went and told odysseus   telemachus gives you this food and says you ought to beg  from all these suitors  shame  he says  is not fitting for those who have to live by handouts   odysseus prayed cautiously   o zeus  bless this telemachus  and may he have all that his heart desires   and with both hands he took the food and set it at his feet  on top of his old ragged bag  and ate  and listened to the singer in the hall  as he was finishing  the music stopped  the suitors shouted  and athena stood  beside odysseus  and prompted him to go among the suitors  begging scraps  to find out which of them were bad or good  although she had no thought of saving any out of the massacre which was to come  he went around and begged from left to right  holding his hand out  like a practiced beggar  they gave him food in pity  and they wondered who this man was and whereabouts he came from  they asked each other  and melanthius   the goatherd  said   you suitors of the queen  listen to me about this stranger here  i saw this man before  the swineherd brought him  i know no more  i do not know his background   antinous began to scold the swineherd   pig man  you famous idiot  why did you bring this man here  do we not have already plenty of homeless people coming here to spoil our feasts  is it not bad enough that they crowd round and eat your master s wealth   you had to ask this other one as well   eumaeus  you replied   antinous  you are a lord  but what you say is trash  who would invite a stranger from abroad unless he had the skills to help the people  a prophet  or a doctor  or a builder  or poet who can sing and bring delight  no one would ask a beggar  they bring only their hunger  out of all the suitors  you are meanest to the slaves  especially me   but if the prudent queen and godlike prince still live here in this house  i do not mind   telemachus said   shush  antinous does not deserve an answer  he is always picking a fight  and goading on the others   then turning to antinous  he said   you care for me so nicely  like a father  you told me i should force the stranger out  may no god make that happen  go to him and give him something  i can spare the food   go on  i tell you  you should pay no heed to mother or the other household slaves belonging to my father  you were not concerned about them anyway  you want to gorge yourself  not share with other people   antinous replied   you little show off  what nasty temper  what an awful comment  if all the suitors gave the same as me  this house could keep him checked for three whole months   he had a footstool underneath the table   for resting his soft feet on while he feasted  he brandished it  the others all gave food and filled the beggar s bag  odysseus had finished with his test  he could have walked back to the threshold  no harm done  instead  he stood beside antinous and said   friend  give me something  you must be the best of all the greeks  you look like royalty  so you should give more food than all the rest  and i will make you known throughout the world   i used to be a rich man  with a palace  when needy beggars came from anywhere  no matter who they were  i gave them food  my slaves were numberless  my wealth was great  i had the life men say is happiness  but zeus destroyed it all  he wanted to  he prompted me to travel with some pirates to egypt  that long journey spelled my ruin  i moored my galleys in the river nile and told my loyal men to stay and guard them   and sent out scouts to all the lookout points  but they were too impulsive  and they sacked the beautiful egyptian fields  and seized women and children  and they killed the men  the screaming reached the town  the people heard  and rushed to come and help  at dawn the plain was all filled up with foot soldiers and horses and flashing bronze  then zeus  who loves the thunder  caused panic in my men disastrous panic  danger was all around us  and not one  stood firm  the sharp bronze swords killed many men  and others were enslaved as laborers  but they gave me to somebody they met  a foreigner named dmetor  king of cyprus  i came from there  such is my tale of woe   antinous replied   what god imposed this pest to spoil our feast  stay over there  not near my table or you can get lost  get killed in egypt or enslaved in cyprus  you barefaced beggar  you come up to us   and these men give you treats unthinkingly  we have so much  and people do not mind sharing another person s wealth   sharp witted odysseus drew back from him and said   you handsome idiot  you would not give a grain of salt from your own house  you sit enjoying someone else s food  and yet you will not give a crumb from this great banquet to me   antinous was furious  and scowling said   that does it  you insult me   you lost the chance to leave with dignity   he lifted up his stool and hurled it at odysseus  right shoulder  near his back  it did not knock him over  like a rock he stood there  shook his head  and silently considered his revenge  then he went back  sat on the threshold and set down the bag  all full of food  and told them   listen  suitors of this world famous queen  i have to speak  when men are fighting for their own possessions   for cows or sheep  there is no shame in wounds  but now antinous has wounded me because i came here hungry  hunger brings such suffering to humans  if there are gods of the poor  or furies to avenge us  may he be struck by death  instead of marriage  he answered   stranger  shut up  or be off  if you keep talking  we young men will drag you across the palace by your hands and feet and have you flayed alive   but all the others  reproached antinous insistently   you ought not to have hit a poor old beggar  if he turns out to be a god from heaven it will end badly  gods disguise themselves as foreigners and strangers to a town  to see who violates their holy laws  and who is good   antinous ignored the suitors  words  the blow increased the pain inside telemachus  heart  but he let fall no tears  he calmly shook his head  and thought about revenge  penelope heard what had happened in the hall  and said to all her slaves   i hope apollo shoots antinous  just as he hit the beggar   and old eurynome replied   if only our prayers were answered  none of them would live to see the dawn ride in upon her throne   penelope said   yes  dear  they are all our enemies and mean to do us harm  antinous is the worst  he is like death   some poor old stranger wandered to this house and asked the men for food  compelled by need  the others helped him out and filled his bag  antinous hurled a footstool at his shoulder   she had this conversation in her room with her attendants  while odysseus was eating dinner  then she called the swineherd   eumaeus  have the stranger come to me  so i may welcome him  and ask if he has heard or witnessed anything about  long lost odysseus  the stranger seems as if he must have traveled far   eumaeus replied   your majesty  i wish these men would quiet down  the tales the stranger tells would charm your heart  for three days and three nights i had him stay with me  he ran away from off a ship  and came to my house first  he started to describe his sufferings  and had not finished  like a singer  blessed by gods with skill in storytelling people  watch him and hope that he will sing forever  so this man s tale enchanted me  he says odysseus and he are old guest friends through their forefathers  this man lived in crete  the home of minos  and he traveled here a rambling route  with dangers compassed round  he says odysseus is still alive and near here  in the rich thesprotian land  and he is bringing home a pile of treasure   penelope said   call him over  let him  tell me in person  while the suitors have their fun here in my house or at the doors  their mood is festive  in their homes they have untasted food and wine  which their house slaves devour  while they are flocking to our house each day to slaughter oxen  sheep  and goats  to feast and drink our wine  with no restraint  our wealth is decimated  there is no man here like odysseus  who could defend the house  but if odysseus comes back  to his own native land  he and his son will soon take vengeance for their violence   telemachus sneezed loudly and the noise resounded through the hall  penelope laughed  and she told eumaeus   call the stranger  my son just sneezed at what i said you heard  it is a sign of death for all the suitors  no one can save them from their ruin now  but listen  if i find this stranger speaking the truth  give him nice clothes a cloak and tunic    at that  the swineherd went and stood beside odysseus  his words had wings   now sir  penelope  telemachus  mother  has summoned you  she feels impelled to ask about her husband  painful though it is  if you tell her the truth and she will know  you will get clothes  you desperately need them  and you can ask for food all through the town  and fill your belly  anyone who wants can give you scraps   strong willed odysseus  answered   eumaeus  i will tell the truth  the whole truth  to penelope  and soon  i know about odysseus  we shared in suffering  but i am very nervous about the rowdy suitors  their aggression touches the iron sky  when i was walking across the hall just now  quite harmlessly  that man hurled something at me  and he hurt me  telemachus did nothing to protect me  and nor did anybody else  so now   tell her to stay right there until night falls  however eager she may be  at dusk  she can come nearer  sit beside the fire  and ask about her husband s journey home  i do have dirty clothes you know it well  since it was you i came to first for help   the swineherd headed back  he crossed the threshold  and sharp penelope said   are you not bringing the traveler  is something wrong  is he too scared or shy  a homeless man  can ill afford such shame   eumaeus answered   his words were common sense  he wants to stay out of the suitors  way  they are aggressive  he says you should stay here until sunset  it is much better for you too  my queen  to speak to him alone   penelope replied   the stranger is no fool at least  there never were such bullies as these men  and they intend us harm   the swineherd went back to the crowd of suitors  and approached  telemachus  and tucked his head down close  so no one else would hear   my friend   he said   i have to go and watch the pigs  and all your property  and mine  you should take care of everything  but most of all  yourself  do not get hurt  so many mean you harm  i pray that zeus obliterates them all  before they injure us   telemachus answered   may it be so  first eat  then go  come back at dawn with animals for meat   the rest is up to me and up to gods   so then eumaeus sat down on the stool  and ate and drank  then went back to his pigs  leaving the palace full of banqueters  it was already late  past afternoon  music and dancing entertained the suitors,25748,4769,-7.9999999999999964,-0.7230089979790604,-0.38770413064361214,-0.70627518617193,-0.44135332716363396,-21.5,-0.952854087743285,-0.5192840007381437,-0.8864856758579867,-0.5094208676028283,-548.9751368958287,-1.1272192278221973,-0.7113413276680001,-0.9155350958577394,-0.6913861813673668,4.295405158730147,-0.9727643935159893,-1.0555186520032156,-1.018265890450268,-0.7917300763218432,118.90499999999955,-0.3547039809713051,-0.2297268229726871,-0.9590709190058035,-0.5472837748809417,21.654166282068793,-0.9553969605582456,-0.6204576931166157,-0.950579563862312,-0.5592873987797383,-13.182153359591508,-1.1421080267853523,-0.6672541134167377,-0.9708144247433107,-0.5292828133959547,"{'neg':

Two beggars then came a man who begged throughout the town of ithaca, notorious for greed. he ate and drank nonstop, so he was fat but weak, with no capacity for fighting. the name his mother gave him as a child was arnaeus, but all the young men called him irus, because he was their messenger. now this man tried to chase odysseus from his own home, and cursed him.  get away, old man! get out! or else you will be dragged

Out by the foot! do you not see the suitors winking to tell me i must throw you out? this is embarrassing for me; i must make you get up right now! or we must fight!  scowling at him, odysseus said,  fool! i did not do you wrong or speak against you. i am not jealous of another beggar receiving gifts, however much he gets. this doorway can accommodate us both. do not hog all the wealth; it is not yours.

You seem to be a homeless man, like me. gods give all mortal blessings. do not stir me to fight or lose my temper. i am old but i will crack your ribs and smash your face to bloody pulp then i will have a day of peace tomorrow; you will not return here to the palace of odysseus.  irus the vagabond was furious.  this greedy pig yaks on like some old woman scrubbing an oven! i will hurt him, punch him

Two-fisted, and rip out his teeth, as farmers pull out the tusks from pigs that damage crops. get ready! let them watch. how could you be so dumb, to pick a fight with someone younger?  so on the threshold at the palace doors their furious aggression reached its peak. antinous, that saintly lord, incited the fight and with a chuckle told the suitors,  my friends! we never had so fine a show brought to this house before. the gods be thanked,

These two are getting ready for a brawl. quick, let us goad them on!  they all jumped up, laughing, and gathered round the ragged beggars. antinous addressed them.  listen, suitors! goat stomachs stuffed with fat and blood are roasting over the fire for dinner. let the beggar who wins the fight choose one of these and take it; and he can always eat with us in future, and we will let no other beggar come to share our company.  they all agreed.

The strategist odysseus deceived them, saying,  my friends, there is no way a man as old as me, worn down by suffering, can fight a younger man. my hunger forces bad choices, tempting me to take the beating. but swear a mighty oath that none of you will step up to help irus out and hit me roughly with fists and make me lose to him.  all of them swore the oath as he had asked. the holy prince telemachus said,  guest,

If your brave spirit urges you to fight against this challenger, you need not worry about the others. anyone who strikes you will face a multitude. i am your host; eurymachus and this antinous are sensible and they agree with me.  they all consented, and odysseus took off his rags and tied them round his waist, revealing massive thighs and mighty shoulders, enormous chest and sturdy arms. athena

Stood near him and increased his strength, to suit the shepherd of the people. all the suitors were flabbergasted, and they said,  this means the end of irus brought upon himself! what muscles underneath the old man s rags!  irus was deeply troubled and afraid; his heart sank. but the house slaves made him gird his tunic and get ready. he was shaking. antinous said,  haha, you big show-off! you would be better dead than so afraid

Of some old man worn down by suffering. if this man beats you, proving he is stronger, i will toss you on board a ship and send you off to king echetus in mainland greece, the lord of cruelty and pain. he will cut off your nose and ears with pitiless bronze, and then your genitals, and he will give them raw to his dogs to eat.  these words increased his shakiness. escorted to the ring, he stood. both raised their fists. odysseus,

Who had endured so many insults, wondered if he should hit him hard enough to kill him, or give him just a tap to knock him down. a light touch would be best, he thought, in case the suitors cottoned on. they came to blows. first irus hit odysseus  shoulder; odysseus punched irus on his neck below the ear, and broke his jaw. red blood gushed from his mouth, and with a moan he fell, teeth chattering, legs flailing. then the suitors

Threw up their hands to cheer, and died of laughter. odysseus seized irus by the foot, dragging him through the gateway to the courtyard, and propped him by the wall. he put a staff into his hand, and said,  sit there and keep the dogs and pigs away! you good-for-nothing! you must not bully visitors and beggars, or you will suffer even worse than this!  then picking up his ragged bag, he slung it across his shoulders by the strap and sat

Beside the door again. the suitors went inside and raised their cups.  may all the gods and zeus give you your heart s desire! that irus was sponging everywhere, the greedy pig. you put a stop to him, and we will send him to echetus, the king of mass destruction.  odysseus was thrilled to hear this omen. antinous set out the big goat s stomach, stuffed full of blood and fat, in front of him. amphinomus provided two bread baskets,

And a gold cup of wine, and welcomed him.  sir, be our guest, and may your future luck be good, though now you have so many troubles.  odysseus replied, his wits about him,  amphinomus, you seem intelligent, like nisus of dulichium, your father; i heard about his wealth and excellence, and that you are his son. you are well-spoken. take note of what i say. of all the creatures that live and breathe and creep on earth, we humans

Are weakest. when the gods bestow on us good fortune, and our legs are spry and limber, we think that nothing can ever can go wrong; but when the gods bring misery and pain, we have to bear our suffering with calm. our mood depends on what zeus sends each day. i once had what most people count as wealth, great riches. i committed many crimes, of violence, abuses of my power, abetted by my brothers and my father.

No one should turn away from what is right; a man should quietly accept whatever the gods may give. i see how wickedly the suitors are behaving wasting wealth and failing to respect the wife of one who soon will come back to his family and homeland. very soon! may spirits guide you home, so you do not meet him when he comes. when he confronts the suitors in this hall there will be blood.  he poured an offering

Of sweet wine to the gods, and took a sip, then passed the cup back to amphinomus, who took it, and then paced around the house, troubled at heart, his head bowed low; he saw the danger in his mind. but he was not fated to live; athena had condemned him to be defeated by telemachus with his strong spear. amphinomus sat down on the same chair that he sat on before. athena, with her gray eyes glinting, gave

Thoughtful penelope a new idea: to let the suitors see her, so desire would open up inside them like a sail, and so her son and husband would respect her. mysteriously, she laughed, and told her slave,  eurynome, i have a new desire: to let the suitors see me, though i hate them. i also want to give my son advice: not to spend so much time with those proud men. they talk impressively, but their intentions

Are bad.  eurynome replied,  my child, your words make sense. but you should wash and oil your skin, not go with blotches on your face to have this conversation with your son. you should not grieve forever, and your boy is older now. you always begged the gods to let you see him grown up, with a beard.  penelope replied with circumspection,  eurynome, i know you care for me, but do not tell me i should wash myself

And put on oil. the gods destroyed my beauty that day my husband left in hollow ships. go call my slave girls, hippodameia and autonoe they must come with me into the hall. i do not want to go to meet the men alone. it would be shameful.  so the old woman went and called the girls. athena s eyes were bright with plans. she poured sweet sleep onto penelope, who lay down on her couch; her joints relaxed; she slept.

Athena gave her gifts of godlike power, to make the men astonished when they saw her. she put ambrosial beauty on her face, the kind that aphrodite, wreathed in myrtle, uses before she dances with the graces. she also made her shapelier and taller, and made her skin more white than ivory. the goddess left. the girls came in; their talking woke up the queen. she felt her cheeks and said,  despite my bitter grief, a peaceful sleep

Enveloped me. if only artemis would bring me gentle death right now to end my misery. i waste my life in longing for my beloved husband, who was good at everything the best of the achaeans.  she went down from her sunny room upstairs. the two slaves went with her. she reached the suitors, and stood beside the central pillar, holding her gauzy veil before her face. her two trustworthy slaves stood either side of her.

The suitors weakened at the knees; desire bewitched them, and they longed to lie with her. she spoke to her dear son, telemachus.  telemachus, you are not thinking straight. when you were still a child, you had good sense. now you are bigger; you have reached adulthood. you are so tall and so good-looking now! people can see you are a rich man s son; even a foreigner would know at once. and yet your judgment is askew. what happened,

That you allowed a guest to be insulted? if strangers in our house are so abused, what then? you will be shamed! your reputation will be destroyed!  telemachus replied with calculated purpose.  mother, i do not blame you for being angry. in my heart i do know right and wrong. i used to be a child; i am not now. but i cannot even afford to think my own heart s thoughts. those evil suitors keep distracting me,

And i have no one on my side. this fight between the stranger and that beggar irus did not turn out as they had wished; the stranger was much the stronger. father zeus! apollo! athena! may the suitors in our house be beaten and bow down their heads, some in the house, and some outside. may each man s body grow weak like irus, out there at the gate, sitting with head slumped down, as if he were intoxicated; he cannot stand up

Nor go back home. his body is too frail.  and then eurymachus spoke up and said,  o queen penelope! wise, prudent daughter of great icarius! if all the greeks could see you now, there would be far more suitors feasting here in your house, from dawn to dusk, because no other woman equals you in beauty, stature, and well-balanced mind.  penelope replied with caution.  no, the deathless gods destroyed my looks that day

The greeks embarked for troy, and my own husband odysseus went with them. if he came and started taking care of me again, i would regain my good name and my beauty. i am weighed down by grief. a spirit set so many troubles on me. at the time that he left ithaca, my husband grabbed my wrist, took my right hand, and said to me,  now wife, i do not think we armored greeks will all come home unharmed from troy. they say

The trojans are good warriors with arrows and javelins, and they ride chariots drawn by swift horses, which can quickly turn the tide of war, in which so many die. some god may bring me home, or i may be captured out there in troy. i do not know. you must remember this: my parents need to be well cared for in our house, as much as now or more so with me gone away. when our son s beard has grown, you must get married

To any man you choose, and leave your house.  those were my husband s words. the time has come; the night when i must marry is at hand. terrible! i am cursed! zeus took away my happiness. another bitter thought oppresses me: it is not right or proper to court a decent woman in this way, a rich man s wife, competing for her hand. they ought to bring fat sheep and cows to feed my family, and give fine gifts, not eat

What is not theirs, and offer nothing back.  odysseus, who had endured so much, was happy she was secretly procuring presents, and charming them with pretty words, while her mind moved elsewhere. antinous said,  wise penelope, take all the presents that any of the greeks would like to bring. refusing gifts is not polite. but we will not go back to our own farms or elsewhere, until you choose the best of us to marry. 

They all agreed and sent their men for gifts. antinous brought out a splendid robe, embroidered, with twelve brooches of pure gold pinned to the fabric. and eurymachus gave her a necklace, finely worked in gold set in with amber beads that shone like sunlight. two slaves brought earrings from eurydamas. they sparkled beautifully, and triple clusters like berries hung from each. pisander s slave brought her a lovely choker, finely made.

All of the suitors gave her different gifts. the queen went upstairs to her room; her slaves carried the splendid presents. then the suitors turned back to watch the dancing and enjoy the captivating music. they stayed there in pleasure, till black evening came. they set three braziers to light the whole great hall, stuffed with dry wood, well seasoned and fresh cut, combined with kindling. the slave girls owned by firm odysseus took turns to light them.

The king himself had all his wits about him, and said,  slave girls! odysseus, your master, has been long gone. go back and sit beside the queen and comfort her. spin yarn or comb the wool. i can provide these men with light. if they decide to stay here till bright dawn rides on her lovely throne, i will not be defeated. i am tough.  at that, the girls began to giggle, peeking at each other. pretty melantho, child of dolius,

Had been brought up by queen penelope, who gave her toys and treated her just like a daughter. but melantho, unconcerned about penelope, was sleeping with eurymachus. she started to insult odysseus, and taunt him.  poor old stranger! you are insane! you did not want to sleep out in the smithy or the public shelter; instead, you come here talking high and mighty among this crowd of men. are you not scared?

Wine may have dulled your senses, or perhaps you always say such idiotic things. has your defeat of irus made you crazy? that beggar? then watch out, a better man may fight you soon, and punch your face so hard you will be kicked out of this house all drenched in blood.  odysseus scowled back and said,  you little dog! i will soon go and tell telemachus what you have said, so he can slice you limb from limb!  that made the women

Tremble with fear; they thought he spoke the truth. they scattered through the house. he took his stand beside the braziers to keep them lit, and looked at all the suitors. in his heart he formed his plans, which soon would be fulfilled. athena wanted pain to sink down deep inside odysseus. she made the suitors keep taunting him. eurymachus was jeering to make the others laugh.  now listen, suitors! i have an intuition that this man

Has come into odysseus  house through some god s will. his head is shining brightly under the lanterns  light perhaps because he is completely bald!  and then he turned and asked odysseus, the city-sacker,  stranger, if i was hiring, would you like to labor on a distant farm for me? you would be paid for sure, if you could plant tall trees, and build stone walls, and i would give you your meals all year and clothes, including footwear.

But you are only skilled at wickedness. you have no wish to work. you like to beg, traipsing around to stuff your greedy belly.  crafty odysseus said,  how i wish, eurymachus, that we could have a contest in springtime in the meadow, when the days are growing longer; i would have a scythe of perfect curvature and so would you. the grass would be abundant; we would test our skill by working all day long, not eating

Until late evening. or if we could plow using a pair of fine and well-fed oxen, strong and both equal in their power to pull, and if we had four acres of good soil, then you would see if i know how to cut a furrow straight. or if zeus suddenly made war begin tomorrow, and i had two spears, a shield, and a helmet all of bronze close-fitted to my head, you would see me amid the throng of fighters at the front 

And you would not hurl insults at my belly. you act aggressive, and you think you are a big strong man, because you spend your time among this tiny group of lowborn louts. but if odysseus appeared, the doors  which are quite wide would start to seem too narrow, as you were struggling to get away.  scowling with rage, eurymachus replied,  you nasty hobo! i will make you pay for showing off in front of all of us.

You should be scared! the wine has made you stupid, or maybe you are always talking nonsense; or you are all puffed up from having won over the beggar irus!  then he hurled a footstool at odysseus, who ducked behind amphinomus in fear; it hit the right hand of the slave boy serving wine; the wine jug fell and clattered on the ground. the boy fell backwards on the dust and moaned. the suitors  shouts resounded through the shadows:

 too bad this foreign drifter did not die before he came here causing all this bother! these arguments with beggars are disrupting our banquet; it is spoiling our nice evening. this silly fuss is dominating things.  telemachus spoke up with dignity.  most noble lords! this is insanity. perhaps you dined too well, or else some god is stirring you. now you have finished dinner, go home and sleep, whenever you are ready.

I will not force you out.  they bit their lips, surprised at the self-confidence he showed. amphinomus, the famous son of nisus, grandson of lord aretias, spoke out to all of them.  my friends! what he has said was fair; no one need take offense. do not abuse the stranger, nor the slaves who work in great odysseus  house. the boy should fill the cups with wine, so we can pour libations, then go home. telemachus

Can take care of the stranger after all, the beggar came to his house.  they agreed. and moulius, the slave amphinomus had brought there from dulichium, mixed wine for all of them and shared the drinks around. they poured libations to the gods and sipped the cheering wine. when they had had enough, each of them went back home, to his own bed.",two beggars then came a man who begged throughout the town of ithaca  notorious for greed  he ate and drank nonstop  so he was fat but weak  with no capacity for fighting  the name his mother gave him as a child was arnaeus  but all the young men called him irus  because he was their messenger  now this man tried to chase odysseus from his own home  and cursed him   get away  old man  get out  or else you will be dragged  out by the foot  do you not see the suitors winking to tell me i must throw you out  this is embarrassing for me  i must make you get up right now  or we must fight   scowling at him  odysseus said   fool  i did not do you wrong or speak against you  i am not jealous of another beggar receiving gifts  however much he gets  this doorway can accommodate us both  do not hog all the wealth  it is not yours   you seem to be a homeless man  like me  gods give all mortal blessings  do not stir me to fight or lose my temper  i am old but i will crack your ribs and smash your face to bloody pulp then i will have a day of peace tomorrow  you will not return here to the palace of odysseus   irus the vagabond was furious   this greedy pig yaks on like some old woman scrubbing an oven  i will hurt him  punch him  two fisted  and rip out his teeth  as farmers pull out the tusks from pigs that damage crops  get ready  let them watch  how could you be so dumb  to pick a fight with someone younger   so on the threshold at the palace doors their furious aggression reached its peak  antinous  that saintly lord  incited the fight and with a chuckle told the suitors   my friends  we never had so fine a show brought to this house before  the gods be thanked   these two are getting ready for a brawl  quick  let us goad them on   they all jumped up  laughing  and gathered round the ragged beggars  antinous addressed them   listen  suitors  goat stomachs stuffed with fat and blood are roasting over the fire for dinner  let the beggar who wins the fight choose one of these and take it  and he can always eat with us in future  and we will let no other beggar come to share our company   they all agreed   the strategist odysseus deceived them  saying   my friends  there is no way a man as old as me  worn down by suffering  can fight a younger man  my hunger forces bad choices  tempting me to take the beating  but swear a mighty oath that none of you will step up to help irus out and hit me roughly with fists and make me lose to him   all of them swore the oath as he had asked  the holy prince telemachus said   guest   if your brave spirit urges you to fight against this challenger  you need not worry about the others  anyone who strikes you will face a multitude  i am your host  eurymachus and this antinous are sensible and they agree with me   they all consented  and odysseus took off his rags and tied them round his waist  revealing massive thighs and mighty shoulders  enormous chest and sturdy arms  athena  stood near him and increased his strength  to suit the shepherd of the people  all the suitors were flabbergasted  and they said   this means the end of irus brought upon himself  what muscles underneath the old man s rags   irus was deeply troubled and afraid  his heart sank  but the house slaves made him gird his tunic and get ready  he was shaking  antinous said   haha  you big show off  you would be better dead than so afraid  of some old man worn down by suffering  if this man beats you  proving he is stronger  i will toss you on board a ship and send you off to king echetus in mainland greece  the lord of cruelty and pain  he will cut off your nose and ears with pitiless bronze  and then your genitals  and he will give them raw to his dogs to eat   these words increased his shakiness  escorted to the ring  he stood  both raised their fists  odysseus   who had endured so many insults  wondered if he should hit him hard enough to kill him  or give him just a tap to knock him down  a light touch would be best  he thought  in case the suitors cottoned on  they came to blows  first irus hit odysseus  shoulder  odysseus punched irus on his neck below the ear  and broke his jaw  red blood gushed from his mouth  and with a moan he fell  teeth chattering  legs flailing  then the suitors  threw up their hands to cheer  and died of laughter  odysseus seized irus by the foot  dragging him through the gateway to the courtyard  and propped him by the wall  he put a staff into his hand  and said   sit there and keep the dogs and pigs away  you good for nothing  you must not bully visitors and beggars  or you will suffer even worse than this   then picking up his ragged bag  he slung it across his shoulders by the strap and sat  beside the door again  the suitors went inside and raised their cups   may all the gods and zeus give you your heart s desire  that irus was sponging everywhere  the greedy pig  you put a stop to him  and we will send him to echetus  the king of mass destruction   odysseus was thrilled to hear this omen  antinous set out the big goat s stomach  stuffed full of blood and fat  in front of him  amphinomus provided two bread baskets   and a gold cup of wine  and welcomed him   sir  be our guest  and may your future luck be good  though now you have so many troubles   odysseus replied  his wits about him   amphinomus  you seem intelligent  like nisus of dulichium  your father  i heard about his wealth and excellence  and that you are his son  you are well spoken  take note of what i say  of all the creatures that live and breathe and creep on earth  we humans  are weakest  when the gods bestow on us good fortune  and our legs are spry and limber  we think that nothing can ever can go wrong  but when the gods bring misery and pain  we have to bear our suffering with calm  our mood depends on what zeus sends each day  i once had what most people count as wealth  great riches  i committed many crimes  of violence  abuses of my power  abetted by my brothers and my father   no one should turn away from what is right  a man should quietly accept whatever the gods may give  i see how wickedly the suitors are behaving wasting wealth and failing to respect the wife of one who soon will come back to his family and homeland  very soon  may spirits guide you home  so you do not meet him when he comes  when he confronts the suitors in this hall there will be blood   he poured an offering  of sweet wine to the gods  and took a sip  then passed the cup back to amphinomus  who took it  and then paced around the house  troubled at heart  his head bowed low  he saw the danger in his mind  but he was not fated to live  athena had condemned him to be defeated by telemachus with his strong spear  amphinomus sat down on the same chair that he sat on before  athena  with her gray eyes glinting  gave  thoughtful penelope a new idea  to let the suitors see her  so desire would open up inside them like a sail  and so her son and husband would respect her  mysteriously  she laughed  and told her slave   eurynome  i have a new desire  to let the suitors see me  though i hate them  i also want to give my son advice  not to spend so much time with those proud men  they talk impressively  but their intentions  are bad   eurynome replied   my child  your words make sense  but you should wash and oil your skin  not go with blotches on your face to have this conversation with your son  you should not grieve forever  and your boy is older now  you always begged the gods to let you see him grown up  with a beard   penelope replied with circumspection   eurynome  i know you care for me  but do not tell me i should wash myself  and put on oil  the gods destroyed my beauty that day my husband left in hollow ships  go call my slave girls  hippodameia and autonoe they must come with me into the hall  i do not want to go to meet the men alone  it would be shameful   so the old woman went and called the girls  athena s eyes were bright with plans  she poured sweet sleep onto penelope  who lay down on her couch  her joints relaxed  she slept   athena gave her gifts of godlike power  to make the men astonished when they saw her  she put ambrosial beauty on her face  the kind that aphrodite  wreathed in myrtle  uses before she dances with the graces  she also made her shapelier and taller  and made her skin more white than ivory  the goddess left  the girls came in  their talking woke up the queen  she felt her cheeks and said   despite my bitter grief  a peaceful sleep  enveloped me  if only artemis would bring me gentle death right now to end my misery  i waste my life in longing for my beloved husband  who was good at everything the best of the achaeans   she went down from her sunny room upstairs  the two slaves went with her  she reached the suitors  and stood beside the central pillar  holding her gauzy veil before her face  her two trustworthy slaves stood either side of her   the suitors weakened at the knees  desire bewitched them  and they longed to lie with her  she spoke to her dear son  telemachus   telemachus  you are not thinking straight  when you were still a child  you had good sense  now you are bigger  you have reached adulthood  you are so tall and so good looking now  people can see you are a rich man s son  even a foreigner would know at once  and yet your judgment is askew  what happened   that you allowed a guest to be insulted  if strangers in our house are so abused  what then  you will be shamed  your reputation will be destroyed   telemachus replied with calculated purpose   mother  i do not blame you for being angry  in my heart i do know right and wrong  i used to be a child  i am not now  but i cannot even afford to think my own heart s thoughts  those evil suitors keep distracting me   and i have no one on my side  this fight between the stranger and that beggar irus did not turn out as they had wished  the stranger was much the stronger  father zeus  apollo  athena  may the suitors in our house be beaten and bow down their heads  some in the house  and some outside  may each man s body grow weak like irus  out there at the gate  sitting with head slumped down  as if he were intoxicated  he cannot stand up  nor go back home  his body is too frail   and then eurymachus spoke up and said   o queen penelope  wise  prudent daughter of great icarius  if all the greeks could see you now  there would be far more suitors feasting here in your house  from dawn to dusk  because no other woman equals you in beauty  stature  and well balanced mind   penelope replied with caution   no  the deathless gods destroyed my looks that day  the greeks embarked for troy  and my own husband odysseus went with them  if he came and started taking care of me again  i would regain

The queen and the beggar odysseus was left there in the hall, and with athena, he was hatching plans for how to kill the suitors. words flew fast:  telemachus, we have to get the weapons and hide them. when the suitors see them gone and question you, come up with good excuses. you can explain,  the soot had damaged them; when king odysseus marched off to troy their metal gleamed; now they are growing dull. i put them safe away from all that smoke.

Some spirit also warned me if you drink too much and argue, you could hurt each other, dishonoring your banquet and your courtship. weapons themselves can tempt a man to fight.   telemachus obeyed his father s word. he summoned eurycleia, and he told her,  shut up the women in their rooms, while i carry my father s weapons to the storeroom. they have got dirty since my father left when i was just a little boy. i want

To keep them safe, protected from the smoke.  the loving nurse said,  child, i wish you would take charge of all the household management and guard the wealth. which girl should bring the torch? you said the slaves were not allowed to walk in front of you.  he said,  this stranger will. a man who eats my bread must work for me, even if he has come from far away.  she made no answer but locked up the doors that led inside the hall. odysseus

And his bright boy jumped up and got the helmets and studded shields and pointed spears. athena stood by them with a golden lamp; she made majestic light. telemachus said,  father, my eyes have noticed something very strange. the palace walls, the handsome fir-wood rafters and crossbeams and the pillars high above are visible, as if a fire were lit. some god from heaven must be in the house.  but cautiously odysseus replied,

 hush, no more questions, discipline your thoughts. this is the way of gods from mount olympus. you need to go to bed. i will stay here, to aggravate the slave girls and your mother, and make her cry, and let her question me.  telemachus went through the hall, lit up by blazing torches, to his room. sleep came, and there he lay till dawn. odysseus stayed in the hall, still plotting with athena how to destroy the suitors. then the queen,

Her wits about her, came down from her room, like artemis or golden aphrodite. slaves pulled her usual chair beside the fire; it was inlaid with whorls of ivory and silver, crafted by icmalius, who had attached a footstool, all in one. a great big fleece was laid across the chair, and pensively penelope sat down. the white-armed slave girls came and cleared away the piles of bread, the tables, and the cups,

From which the arrogant suitors had been drinking. they threw the embers from the braziers onto the floor, and heaped fresh wood inside them for light and warmth. and then melantho scolded odysseus again.  hey! stranger! will you keep causing trouble, roaming round our house at night and spying on us women here? get out, you tramp! be happy with your meal! or you will soon get pelted with a torch! be off!  odysseus began to scowl,

And made a calculated speech.  insane! you silly girl, why are you mad at me? because i am all dirty, dressed in rags, and begging through the town? i have no choice. that is how homeless people have to live. i used to have a house, and i was rich, respectable, and often gave to beggars; i helped whoever came, no matter what. i had a lot of slave girls too, and all the things we count as wealth; the happy life.

Zeus ruined it. he must have wanted to. girl, may you never lose the rank you have among the other slave girls if your mistress gets angry, or odysseus arrives. it might still happen. but if he is dead and never coming back, his son is now a man, praise be apollo. he will notice any misconduct from the women here. he is a grown-up now.  penelope had listened warily, and now she spoke

To scold the slave.  you brazen, shameless dog! what impudence! i see what you are doing! wipe that impertinent expression off! you knew quite well i told you so myself  that i might keep the stranger in the hall to question him about my missing husband. i am weighed down by grief.  and then she turned to tell eurynome,  bring out a chair and put a cushion on it, so this stranger can sit and talk with me. i want to ask him

Some questions.  so the woman brought a chair of polished wood, and set a cushion on it. odysseus knew how to bide his time. he sat, and circumspect penelope began the conversation.  stranger, first i want to ask what people you have come from. who are your parents? where is your home town?  cunning odysseus said,  my good woman, no mortal on the earth would speak against you; your glory reaches heaven. you must be

The daughter of a holy king who ruled a mighty people with good laws; his rule made the black earth grow wheat and barley; trees were full of fruit; the sheep had lambs; the sea provided fish, and people thrived. this is your house. you have the right to question me, but do not ask about my family or native land. the memory will fill my heart with pain. i am a man of sorrow. i should not sit in someone else s house

Lamenting. it is rude to keep on grieving. the slaves, or even you, might criticize and say my tearfulness is caused by wine.  penelope said cautiously,  well, stranger, the deathless gods destroyed my strength and beauty the day the greeks went marching off to troy, and my odysseus went off with them. if he came back and cared for me again, i would regain my beauty and my status. but now i suffer dreadfully; some god

Has ruined me. the lords of all the islands, same, dulichium, and zacynthus, and those who live in ithaca, are courting me though i do not want them to! and spoiling my house. i cannot deal with suppliants, strangers and homeless men who want a job. i miss odysseus; my heart is melting. the suitors want to push me into marriage, but i spin schemes. some god first prompted me to set my weaving in the hall and work

A long fine cloth. i said to all my suitors,  although odysseus is dead, postpone requests for marriage till i finish weaving this sheet to shroud laertes when he dies. my work should not be wasted, or the people in argos will reproach me, if a man who won such wealth should lie without a shroud.  they acquiesced. by day i wove the web, and in the night by torchlight, i unwove it. i tricked them for three years; long hours went by

And days and months, but then, in the fourth year, with help from my own fickle, doglike slave girls, they came and caught me at it. then they shouted in protest, and they made me finish it. i have no more ideas, and i cannot fend off a marriage anymore. my parents are pressing me to marry, and my son knows that these men are wasting all his wealth and he is sick of it. he has become quite capable of caring for a house

That zeus has glorified. and now, you must reveal your ancestry. you were not born from rocks or trees, as in a fairy tale.  the master of deception answered,  wife of great odysseus, laertes  son, why will you not stop asking me about my family? i will speak, if i must. but you are making all my troubles worse. it is the way of things, when someone is away from home as long as i have been,

Roaming through many cities, many dangers. still, i will tell you what you ask. my homeland is crete, a fertile island out at sea. i cannot count how many people live there, in ninety cities, and our languages are mixed; there are achaeans, native cretans, and long-haired dorians and pelasgians. knossos is there, a mighty city where minos, the intimate of zeus, was king for nine years, and my father was his son,

The brave deucalion, whose other son was idomeneus, who sailed to troy with the two sons of atreus. my name is aethon, and i am the younger brother. in crete, i saw odysseus, and gave him guest-gifts. a storm had driven him off course at malea, and carried him to crete, although he yearned for troy. he narrowly escaped the winds and found a refuge, mooring his ships in amnisus, beside the cave

Of eileithyia. he came up to town, and asked to see my brother, who, he said, was his good friend, a man he much admired. but idomeneus had sailed to troy ten days before. i asked him and his crew inside and gave them all a lavish welcome; our stores were ample, and i made the people bring barley and red wine and bulls to butcher, to satisfy their hearts. those noble greeks stayed for twelve days; a mighty north wind trapped them;

So strong a person could not stand upright; some spirit must have summoned it to curse them. but on the thirteenth day, the wind died down; they sailed away.  his lies were like the truth, and as she listened, she began to weep. her face was melting, like the snow that zephyr scatters across the mountain peaks; then eurus thaws it, and as it melts, the rivers swell and flow again. so were her lovely cheeks dissolved with tears. she wept for her own husband,

Who was right next to her. odysseus pitied his grieving wife inside his heart, but kept his eyes quite still, without a flicker, like horn or iron, and he hid his tears with artifice. she cried a long, long time, then spoke again.  now stranger, i would like to set a test, to see if you did host my husband and the men that followed him in your own house, as you have said. describe his clothes, and what he looked like, and his men. 

Odysseus the trickster said,  my lady, that would be hard to say his visit was so long ago. it has been twenty years. but i will tell the image in my mind. kingly odysseus wore a purple cloak, of double-folded wool, held fastened by a golden brooch with double pins, that was elaborately engraved. in its front paws a dog held down a struggling dappled fawn. all those who saw it marveled how the dog

Could grip the fawn, and how the fawn could kick its legs and try to get away, though both were made of gold. i noticed his white tunic was soft as dried-up onion peel, and shiny as sunlight. it astonished many women. but note, i do not know if he had brought these clothes from home, or if a crew member had given them to him on board the ship, or some guest-friend. odysseus had many dear friends, since very few could match his worth.

And i myself gave him a sword of bronze, a double-folded purple cloak, and tunic edged with a fringe. i sent him off in glory when he embarked. he had a valet with him, i do remember, named eurybates, a man a little older than himself, who had black skin, round shoulders, woolly hair, and was his favorite out of all his crew because his mind matched his.  these words increased her grief. she knew the signs that he had planted

As evidence, and sobbed; she wept profusely. pausing, she said,  i pitied you before, but now you are a guest and honored friend. i gave those clothes to him that you describe; i took them from the storeroom, folded them, and clasped that brooch for him. but i will never welcome him home. a curse sailed on that ship when he went off to see evilium  the town i will not name.  he answered shrewdly,  your majesty, odysseus  wife,

Stop ruining your pretty skin with tears, and grieving for your husband, brokenhearted. i do not blame you; any woman would mourn for a husband by whom she had children, even if he were not the kind of man they say your husband was a godlike hero. but stop your crying. listen. i will tell you a certainty. i will be frank with you. i heard odysseus is coming home. he is alive and near here, in thesprotia.

By hustling, he gained a heap of treasure that he is bringing home. he lost his ship at sea, and let his loyal men be killed when he had left thrinacia; helius and zeus despised odysseus, because his men had killed the cattle of the sun. so all those men were drowned beneath the waves, but he himself was clinging to the rudder and washed up in the land of the phaeacians, the cousins of the gods. they honored him

As if he were a god himself, and gave him abundant gifts, and tried to send him home safely. he would have been here long ago, but he decided he should travel more and gather greater wealth. no man on earth knows better how to make a profit. pheidon, the king of the thesprotians, told me this. he poured libations and he swore to me there was a ship already launched and crew all set to take him home. but pheidon said

Good-bye to me first, as a ship of theirs happened to be already on its way to barley-rich dulichium. he showed me the treasure that odysseus had gained  enough to feed his children and grandchildren for ten whole generations. pheidon said odysseus had gone to dodona, to ask the rustling oak leaves whether zeus advised him, after all those years away, to go home openly or in disguise.

I tell you, he is safe and near at hand. he will not long be absent from his home and those that love him. i swear this by zeus, the highest, greatest god, and by the hearth where i am sheltering. this will come true as i have said. this very lunar month, between the waning and the waxing moon odysseus will come.  penelope said warily,  well, stranger, i do hope that you are right. if so, i would reward you

At once with such warm generosity that everyone you met would see your luck. in fact, it seems to me, odysseus will not come home. no one will see you off with kind good-byes. there is no master here to welcome visitors as he once did and send them off with honor. was there ever a man like him? now slaves, give him a wash and make a bed with mattress, woolen blankets and fresh clean sheets, to keep him warm till dawn

Assumes her golden throne. then bathe and oil him; seat him inside the hall, beside my son, and let him eat. if any of these men is so corrupt that he would harm our guest, the worse for him! he will get nowhere here, however much he rages. stranger, how could you have evidence that i excel all other women in intelligence, if you were kept in rags, your skin all sunburnt, in my house? human beings have short lives.

If we are cruel, everyone will curse us during our life, and mock us when we die. the names of those who act with nobleness are brought by travelers across the world, and many people speak about their goodness.  but devious odysseus said,  wife of great odysseus, i started hating blankets and fine clean sheets the day i rowed from cloudy, mountainous crete. i will lie down as i have spent so many sleepless nights,

On some rough pallet, waiting for bright dawn. i do not care for footbaths; do not let any of these slave women in your house come near my feet, unless there is an old one whom i can trust, who has endured the same heartbreak and sorrow as myself. if so, i would not mind if she should touch my feet.  penelope said thoughtfully,  dear guest, how well you speak! no visitor before who came into my house from foreign lands

Has ever been so scrupulous. i have a sensible old woman, who brought up my husband. she first took him in her arms from his own mother as a newborn child. she is quite weak, but she can wash your feet. get up now, eurycleia, wash your master s age-mate. by now, odysseus himself must have old wrinkled feet and hands like these. we mortals grow old fast in times of trouble.  the old slave shed hot tears, and held her hands

Across her face, and wailed,  oh, child! i am so useless to you now! zeus hated you beyond all other men, although you are so god-fearing! no human ever burned so many thigh-bones to the lord of thunder, or sacrificed so much to him. you prayed that you would reach a comfortable old age and raise your son to be respected. now you are the only one who cannot reach your home. and when that poor odysseus

Stays at the palaces of foreign kings, i think the women slaves are mocking him as these bad girls are hounding you. you have refused to let them wash you, to avoid abuse. but wise penelope has told me to wash you, and reluctantly i will, for her sake and for yours you move my heart. now listen. many strangers have come here in trouble and distress. but i have never seen any man whose body, voice, and feet

Are so much like my master s.  he replied shrewdly,  old woman, everyone who sees the two of us says we are much alike; you were perceptive to observe the likeness.  then the old woman took the shining cauldron used for a footbath, and she filled it up with water lots of cold, a splash of hot. odysseus sat there beside the hearth, and hurriedly turned round to face the darkness. he had a premonition in his heart

That when she touched him, she would feel his scar and all would be revealed. she kneeled beside him, and washed her master. suddenly, she felt the scar. a white-tusked boar had wounded him on mount parnassus long ago. he went there with his maternal cousins and grandfather, noble autolycus, who was the best of all mankind at telling lies and stealing. hermes gave him this talent to reward him for burning many offerings to him.

Much earlier, autolycus had gone to ithaca to see his daughter s baby, and eurycleia put the newborn child on his grandfather s lap and said,  now name your grandson this much-wanted baby boy.  he told the parents,  name him this. i am disliked by many, all across the world, and i dislike them back. so name the child  odysseus.  and when he is a man, let him come to his mother s people s house,

By mount parnassus. i will give him treasure and send him home rejoicing.  when he grew, odysseus came there to claim his gifts. his cousins and autolycus embraced him, and greeted him with friendly words of welcome. his grandma, amphithea, wrapped her arms around him like a vine and kissed his face and shining eyes. autolycus instructed his sons to make the dinner. they obeyed and brought a bull of five years old and flayed it,

And chopped it all in pieces, and then sliced the meat with skill and portioned it on skewers and roasted it with care, and shared it out, and everybody got the same amount. the whole day long they feasted, till the sun went down and darkness fell. then they lay down and took the gift of sleep. when early dawn, the newborn child with rosy hands, appeared, autolycus went hunting with his dogs and with his sons; odysseus went too.

Up the steep wooded side of mount parnassus they climbed and reached its windswept folds. the sun rose from the calmly flowing depths of ocean to touch the fields, just as the hunters came into a glen. the dogs had dashed in front, looking for tracks. autolycus  sons came after, with odysseus who kept close to the dogs, and brandished his long spear. a mighty boar lurked there; its lair was thick, protected from the wind; the golden sun

Could never strike at it with shining rays, and rain could not get in; there was a pile of fallen leaves inside. the boar had heard the sound of feet the men and dogs were near. out of his hiding place he leapt to face them, his bristles standing up, his eyes like fire, and stood right next to them. odysseus was first to rush at him, his long spear gripped tight in his hand. he tried to strike; the boar struck first, above his knee, and charging sideways

Scooped a great hunk of flesh off with his tusk, but did not reach the bone. odysseus wounded the boar s right shoulder, and the spear pierced through. the creature howled and fell to earth. his life flew out. autolycus  sons bustled around and skillfully bound up the wound received by great odysseus, and stopped the black blood with a charm, and took him back to their father s house, and nursed him well, then gave him splendid gifts, and promptly sent him

Back home to ithaca, and he was glad. his parents welcomed him and asked him questions, wanting to know how he had got the wound. he told them he was hunting with his cousins on mount parnassus, and a boar attacked him; the white tusk pierced his leg. the old slave woman, holding his leg and rubbing with flat palms, came to that place, and recognized the scar. she let his leg fall down into the basin. it clattered, tilted over, and the water

Spilled out across the floor. both joy and grief took hold of her. her eyes were filled with tears; her voice was choked. she touched his beard and said,  you are odysseus! my darling child! my master! i did not know it was you until i touched you all around your leg.  she glanced towards penelope, to tell her it was her husband. but penelope did not look back; she could not meet her eyes, because athena turned her mind aside.

Odysseus grabbed her throat with his right hand and with the left, he pulled her close and whispered,  nanny! why are you trying to destroy me? you fed me at your breast! now after all my twenty years of pain, i have arrived back to my home. you have found out; a god has put the knowledge in your mind. be silent; no one must know, or else i promise you, if some god helps me bring the suitors down, i will not spare you when i kill the rest,

The other slave women, although you were my nurse.  with calculation, eurycleia answered,  my child! what have you said! you know my mind is firm, unshakable; i will remain as strong as stone or iron. let me promise you this: if you defeat the suitors, i will tell you which women in the palace dishonor you, and which are free from guilt.  odysseus already had a plan.  nanny, why do you mention them? no need.

I will myself make my own observations of each of them. be quiet now; entrust the future to the gods.  the old nurse went to fetch more washing water; all the rest was spilt. she washed and oiled him, and then he pulled his chair beside the fire again, to warm himself, and covered up his scar with rags. and carefully penelope spoke to him.  stranger, i have one small question i want to ask you. it will soon be time

To lie down comfortably at least for those who can enjoy sweet sleep, no matter what. but i have been afflicted by some god with pain beyond all measure. in the day, i concentrate on my work and my women s, despite my constant grief. but when night comes, and everybody goes to sleep, i lie crying in bed and overwhelmed by pain; worries and sorrows crowd into my heart. as when the daughter of pandareus,

The pale gray nightingale, sings beautifully when spring has come, and sits among the leaves that crowd the trees, and warbles up and down a symphony of sound, in mourning for her son by zethus, darling itylus, whom she herself had killed in ignorance, with bronze. just so, my mind pulls two directions  should i stay here beside my son, and keep things all the same my property, my slave girls, and my great house to show respect towards

My husband s bed and what the people say? or should i marry one of them whichever is best of all the suitors and can bring most presents? when my son was immature, and young, i could not leave my husband s house. he would not let me. now that he is big and all grown-up, he urges me to go; he is concerned that they are eating up his property. now how do you interpret this dream of mine? i dreamed that twenty geese

Came from the river to my house, and they were eating grain and i was glad to see them. then a huge eagle with a pointed beak swooped from the mountain, broke their necks, and killed them. i wept and wailed, inside the dream; the women gathered around me, and i cried because the eagle killed my geese. then he came back and sitting on the jutting roof-beam, spoke in human language, to restrain my grief.  penelope, great queen, cheer up. this is

No dream; it will come true. it is a vision. the geese are suitors; i was once an eagle, but now i am your husband. i have come back home to put a cruel end to them.  then i woke up, looked round, and saw the geese still eating grain beside the trough as they had done before.  odysseus, well-known for his intelligence, said,  my dear woman, there is no way to wrest another meaning out of the dream; odysseus himself

Said how he will fulfill it: it means ruin for all the suitors. no one can protect them from death.  but shrewd penelope said,  stranger, dreams are confusing, and not all come true. there are two gates of dreams: one pair is made of horn and one of ivory. the dreams from ivory are full of trickery; their stories turn out false. the ones that come through polished horn come true. but my strange dream did not come out that way, i think. i wish

It had, as does my son. the day of doom is coming that will take me from the house of my odysseus. i will arrange a contest with his axes. he would set them all in a row, like ship s props. from a distance he shot an arrow through all twelve of them. i will assign this contest to the suitors. whoever strings his bow most readily, and shoots through all twelve axes, will win me, and i will follow him. i will be parted

From here, this lovely house, my marriage home, so full of wealth and life, which i suppose i will remember even in my dreams.  scheming odysseus said,  honored wife of great odysseus, do not postpone this contest. they will fumble with the bow and will not finish stringing it or shooting the arrow through, before odysseus, the mastermind, arrives.  she chose her words with care:  if you would sit and entertain me,

Guest, i would never wish to go to sleep. but humans cannot stay awake forever; immortal gods have set a proper time for everything that mortals do on earth. i will go up and lie down on my bed, which is a bed of grief, all stained with tears that i have cried since he went off to see evilium, the town i will not name. i will lie there, and you lie in this house; spread blankets on the floor, or have the slaves

Make up a bed.  with that, she went upstairs, accompanied by slave girls. in her room, she cried for her dear husband, till sharp-sighted athena poured sweet sleep onto her eyes.",the queen and the beggar odysseus was left there in the hall  and with athena  he was hatching plans for how to kill the suitors  words flew fast   telemachus  we have to get the weapons and hide them  when the suitors see them gone and question you  come up with good excuses  you can explain   the soot had damaged them  when king odysseus marched off to troy their metal gleamed  now they are growing dull  i put them safe away from all that smoke   some spirit also warned me if you drink too much and argue  you could hurt each other  dishonoring your banquet and your courtship  weapons themselves can tempt a man to fight    telemachus obeyed his father s word  he summoned eurycleia  and he told her   shut up the women in their rooms  while i carry my father s weapons to the storeroom  they have got dirty since my father left when i was just a little boy  i want  to keep them safe  protected from the smoke   the loving nurse said   child  i wish you would take charge of all the household management and guard the wealth  which girl should bring the torch  you said the slaves were not allowed to walk in front of you   he said   this stranger will  a man who eats my bread must work for me  even if he has come from far away   she made no answer but locked up the doors that led inside the hall  odysseus  and his bright boy jumped up and got the helmets and studded shields and pointed spears  athena stood by them with a golden lamp  she made majestic light  telemachus said   father  my eyes have noticed something very strange  the palace walls  the handsome fir wood rafters and crossbeams and the pillars high above are visible  as if a fire were lit  some god from heaven must be in the house   but cautiously odysseus replied    hush  no more questions  discipline your thoughts  this is the way of gods from mount olympus  you need to go to bed  i will stay here  to aggravate the slave girls and your mother  and make her cry  and let her question me   telemachus went through the hall  lit up by blazing torches  to his room  sleep came  and there he lay till dawn  odysseus stayed in the hall  still plotting with athena how to destroy the suitors  then the queen   her wits about her  came down from her room  like artemis or golden aphrodite  slaves pulled her usual chair beside the fire  it was inlaid with whorls of ivory and silver  crafted by icmalius  who had attached a footstool

grip the fawn  and how the fawn could kick its legs and try to get away  though both were made of gold  i noticed his white tunic was soft as dried up onion peel  and shiny as sunlight  it astonished many women  but note  i do not know if he had brought these clothes from home  or if a crew member had given them to him on board the ship  or some guest friend  odysseus had many dear friends  since very few could match his worth   and i myself gave him a sword of bronze  a double folded purple cloak  and tunic edged with a fringe  i sent him off in glory when he embarked  he had a valet with him  i do remember  named eurybates  a man a little older than himself  who had black skin  round shoulders  woolly hair  and was his favorite out of all his crew because his mind matched his   these words increased her grief  she knew the signs that he had planted  as evidence  and sobbed  she wept profusely  pausing  she said   i pitied you before  but now you are a guest and honored friend  i gave those clothes to him that you describe  i took them from the storeroom  folded them  and clasped that brooch for him  but i will never welcome him home  a curse sailed on that ship when he went off to see evilium  the town i will not name   he answered shrewdly   your majesty  odysseus  wife   stop ruining your pretty skin with tears  and grieving for your husband  brokenhearted  i do not blame you  any woman would mourn for a husband by whom she had children  even if he were not the kind of man they say your husband was a godlike hero  but stop your crying  listen  i will tell you a certainty  i will be frank with you  i heard odysseus is coming home  he is alive and near here  in thesprotia   by hustling  he gained a heap of treasure that he is bringing home  he lost his ship at sea  and let his loyal men be killed when he had left thrinacia  helius and zeus despised odysseus  because his men had killed the cattle of the sun  so all those men were drowned beneath the waves  but he himself was clinging to the rudder and washed up in the land of the phaeacians  the cousins of the gods  they honored him  as if he were a god himself  and gave him abundant gifts  and tried to send him home safely  he would have been here long ago  but he decided he should travel more and gather greater wealth  no man on earth knows better how to make a profit  pheidon  the king of the thesprotians  told me this  he poured libations and he swore to me there was a ship already launched and crew all set to take him home  but pheidon said  good bye to me first  as a ship of theirs happened to be already on its way to barley rich dulichium  he showed me the treasure that odysseus had gained  enough to feed his children and grandchildren for ten whole generations  pheidon said odysseus had gone to dodona  to ask the rustling oak leaves whether zeus advised him  after all those years away  to go home openly or in disguise   i tell you  he is safe and near at hand  he will not long be absent from his home and those that love him  i swear this by zeus  the highest  greatest god  and by the hearth where i am sheltering  this will come true as i have said  this very lunar month  between the waning and the waxing moon odysseus will come   penelope said warily   well  stranger  i do hope that you are right  if so  i would reward you  at once with such warm generosity that everyone you met would see your luck  in fact  it seems to me  odysseus will not come home  no one will see you off with kind good byes  there is no master here to welcome visitors as he once did and send them off with honor  was there ever a man like him  now slaves  give him a wash and make a bed with mattress  woolen blankets and fresh clean sheets  to keep him warm till dawn  assumes her golden throne  then bathe and oil him  seat him inside the hall  beside my son  and let him eat  if any of these men is so corrupt that he would harm our guest  the worse for him  he will get nowhere here  however much he rages  stranger  how could you have evidence that i excel all other women in intelligence  if you were kept in rags  your skin all sunburnt  in my house  human beings have short lives   if we are cruel  everyone will curse us during our life  and mock us when we die  the names of those who act with nobleness are brought by travelers across the world  and many people speak about their goodness   but devious odysseus said   wife of great odysseus  i started hating blankets and fine clean sheets the day i rowed from cloudy  mountainous crete  i will lie down as i have spent so many sleepless nights   on some rough pallet  waiting for bright dawn  i do not care for footbaths  do not let any of these slave women in your house come near my feet  unless there is an old one whom i can trust  who has endured the same heartbreak and sorrow as myself  if so  i would not mind if she should touch my feet   penelope said thoughtfully   dear guest  how well you speak  no visitor before who came into my house from foreign lands  has ever been so scrupulous  i have a sensible old woman  who brought up my husband  she first took him in her arms from his own mother as a newborn child  she is quite weak  but she can wash your feet  get up now  eurycleia  wash your master s age mate  by now  odysseus himself must have old wrinkled feet and hands like these  we mortals grow old fast in times of trouble   the old slave she would hot tears  and held her hands  across her face  and wailed   oh  child  i am so useless to you now  zeus hated you beyond all other men  although you are so god fearing  no human ever burned so many thigh bones to the lord of thunder  or sacrificed so much to him  you prayed that you would reach a comfortable old age and raise your son to be respected  now you are the only one who cannot reach your home  and when that poor odysseus  stays at the palaces of foreign kings  i think the women slaves are mocking him as these bad girls are hounding you  you have refused to let them wash you  to avoid abuse  but wise penelope has told me to wash you  and reluctantly i will  for her sake and for yours you move my heart  now listen  many strangers have come here in trouble and distress  but i have never seen any man whose body  voice  and feet  are so much like my master s   he replied shrewdly   old woman  everyone who sees the two of us says we are much alike  you were perceptive to observe the likeness   then the old woman took the shining cauldron used for a footbath  and she filled it up with water lots of cold  a splash of hot  odysseus sat there beside the hearth  and hurriedly turned round to face the darkness  he had a premonition in his heart  that when she touched him  she would feel his scar and all would be revealed  she kneeled beside him  and washed her master  suddenly  she felt the scar  a white tusked boar had wounded him on mount parnassus long ago  he went there with his maternal cousins and grandfather  noble autolycus  who was the best of all mankind at telling lies and stealing  hermes gave him this talent to reward him for burning many offerings to him   much earlier  autolycus had gone to ithaca to see his daughter s baby  and eurycleia put the newborn child on his grandfather s lap and said   now name your grandson this much wanted baby boy   he told the parents   name him this  i am disliked by many  all across the world  and i dislike them back  so name the child  odysseus   and when he is a man  let him come to his mother s people s house   by mount parnassus  i will give him treasure and send him home rejoicing   when he grew  odysseus came there to claim his gifts  his cousins and autolycus embraced him  and greeted him with friendly words of welcome  his grandma  amphithea  wrapped her arms around him like a vine and kissed his face and shining eyes  autolycus instructed his sons to make the dinner  they obeyed and brought a bull of five years old and flayed it   and chopped it all in pieces  and then sliced the meat with skill and portioned it on skewers and roasted it with care  and shared it out  and everybody got the same amount  the whole day long they feasted  till the sun went down and darkness fell  then they lay down and took the gift of sleep  when early dawn  the newborn child with rosy hands  appeared  autolycus went hunting with his dogs and with his sons  odysseus went too   up the steep wooded side of mount parnassus they climbed and reached its windswept folds  the sun rose from the calmly flowing depths of ocean to touch the fields  just as the hunters came into a glen  the dogs had dashed in front  looking for tracks  autolycus  sons came after  with odysseus who kept close to the dogs  and brandished his long spear  a mighty boar lurked there  its lair was thick  protected from the wind  the golden sun  could never strike at it with shining rays  and rain could not get in  there was a pile of fallen leaves inside  the boar had heard the sound of feet the men and dogs were near  out of his hiding place he leapt to face them  his bristles standing up  his eyes like fire  and stood right next to them  odysseus was first to rush at him  his long spear gripped tight in his hand  he tried to strike  the boar struck first  above his knee  and charging sideways  scooped a great hunk of flesh off with his tusk  but did not reach the bone  odysseus wounded the boar s right shoulder  and the spear pierced through  the creature howled and fell to earth  his life flew out  autolycus  sons bustled around and skillfully bound up the wound received by great odysseus  and stopped the black blood with a charm  and took him back to their father s house  and nursed him well  then gave him splendid gifts  and promptly sent him  back home to ithaca  and he was glad  his parents welcomed him and asked him questions  wanting to know how he had got the wound  he told them he was hunting with his cousins on mount parnassus  and a boar attacked him  the white tusk pierced his leg  the old slave woman  holding his leg and rubbing with flat palms  came to that place  and recognized the scar  she let his leg fall down into the basin  it clattered  tilted over  and the water  spilled out across the floor  both joy and grief took hold of her  her eyes were filled with tears  her voice was choked  she touched his beard and said   you are odysseus  my darling child  my master  i did not know it was you until i touched you all around your leg   she glanced towards penelope  to tell her it was her husband  but penelope did not look back  she could not meet her eyes  because athena turned her mind aside   odysseus grabbed her throat with his right hand and with the left  he pulled her close and whispered   nanny  why are you trying to destroy me  you fed me at your breast  now after all my twenty years of pain  i have arrived back to my home  you have found out  a god has put the knowledge in your mind  be silent  no one must know  or else i promise you  if some god helps me bring the suitors down  i will not spare you when i kill the rest   the other slave women  although you were my nurse   with calculation  eurycleia answered   my child  what have you said  you know my mind is firm  unshakable  i will remain as strong as stone or iron  let me promise you this  if you defeat the suitors  i will tell you which women in the palace dishonor you  and which are free from guilt   odysseus already had a plan   nanny  why do you mention them  no need   i will myself make my own observations of each of them  be quiet now  entrust the future to the gods   the old nurse went to fetch more washing water  all the rest was spilt  she washed and oiled him  and then he pulled his chair beside the fire again  to warm himself  and covered up his scar with rags  and carefully penelope spoke to him   stranger  i have one small question i want to ask you  it will soon be time  to lie down comfortably at least for those who can enjoy sweet sleep  no matter what  but i have been afflicted by some god with pain beyond all measure  in the day  i concentrate on my work and my women s  despite my constant grief  but when night comes  and everybody goes to sleep  i lie crying in bed and overwhelmed by pain  worries and sorrows crowd into my heart  as when the daughter of pandareus   the pale gray nightingale  sings beautifully when spring has come  and sits among the leaves that crowd the trees  and warbles up and down a symphony of sound  in mourning for her son by zethus  darling itylus  whom she herself had killed in ignorance  with bronze  just so  my mind pulls two directions  should i stay here beside my son  and keep things all the same my property  my slave girls  and my great house to show respect towards  my husband s bed and what the people say  or should i marry one of them whichever is best of all the suitors and can bring most presents  when my son was immature  and young  i could not leave my husband s house  he would not let me  now that he is big and all grown up  he urges me to go  he is concerned that they are eating up his property  now how do you interpret this dream of mine  i dreamed that twenty geese  came from the river to my house  and they were eating grain and i was glad to see them  then a huge eagle with a pointed beak swooped from the mountain  broke their necks  and killed them  i wept and wailed  inside the dream  the women gathered around me  and i cried because the eagle killed my geese  then he came back and sitting on the jutting roof beam  spoke in human language  to restrain my grief   penelope  great queen  cheer up  this is  no dream  it will come true  it is a vision  the geese are suitors  i was once an eagle  but now i am your husband  i have come back home to put a cruel end to them   then i woke up  looked round  and saw the geese still eating grain beside the trough as they had done before   odysseus  well known for his intelligence  said   my dear woman  there is no way to wrest another meaning out of the dream  odysseus himself  said how he will fulfill it  it means ruin for all the suitors  no one can protect them from death   but shrewd penelope said   stranger  dreams are confusing  and not all come true  there are two gates of dreams  one pair is made of horn and one of ivory  the dreams from ivory are full of trickery  their stories turn out false  the ones that come through polished horn come true  but my strange dream did not come out that way  i think  i wish  it had  as does my son  the day of doom is coming that will take me from the house of my odysseus  i will arrange a contest with his axes  he would set them all in a row  like ship s props  from a distance he shot an arrow through all twelve of them  i will assign this contest to the suitors  whoever strings his bow most readily  and shoots through all twelve axes  will win me  and i will follow him  i will be parted  from here  this lovely house  my marriage home  so full of wealth and life  which i suppose i will remember even in my dreams   scheming odysseus said   honored wife of great odysseus  do not postpone this contest  they will fumble with the bow and will not finish stringing it or shooting the arrow through  before odysseus  the mastermind  arrives   she chose her words with care   if you would sit and entertain me   guest  i would never wish to go to sleep  but humans cannot stay awake forever  immortal gods have set a proper time for everything that mortals do on earth  i will go up and lie down on my bed  which is a bed of grief  all stained with tears that i have cried since he went off to see evilium  the town i will not name  i will lie there  and you lie in this house  spread blankets on the floor  or have the slaves  make up a bed   with that  she went upstairs  accompanied by slave girls  in her room  she cried for her dear husband  till sharp sighted athena poured sweet sleep onto her eyes,25699,4825,24.300000000000022,-0.0023241899124945282,0.10874159462055755,-0.12783439677429975,0.027060897105684482,20.300000000000022,-0.0058057687022541864,0.09780402288245095,-0.11866280915094332,0.0648591183991958,0.0,-0.058615953765032786,-0.006987110545359707,-0.08303723958095577,-0.009072190283058336,27.309903571428567,0.3551903253915825,0.09134055099880052,0.048328259538079454,-0.02483260865073442,156.37599999999966,0.5576406677282444,0.5566158995640265,-0.10115956384948811,-0.05441180065551687,243.4259411774252,-0.16648852648878223,-0.12498515658736027,-0.30902256882258544,-0.1481373742112955,1.7470066017024661,0.10884551839125267,0.13480831286982836,0.034808944971434864,0.10673809542948716,"{'neg':

The last banquet odysseus was lying at the entrance on an untreated oxhide, over which he heaped a pile of fleeces from the sheep the suitors sacrificed. eurynome spread a thick blanket over him. he lay there but did not sleep; his mind was plotting how to kill the suitors. then the girls who had been sleeping with suitors slipped outside, giggling and happy to be out together. his heart was roused to rage; he wondered whether

To jump at them and slaughter every one, or let them have one very final night with those proud suitors and his heart was barking, just as a mother dog will stand astride her little puppies, bristling to fight, if she sees any man she does not know; so his heart growled inside him; he was shocked at their behavior. he slapped his chest and told himself,  be strong, my heart. you were hounded by worse the day the cyclops ate

Your strong companions. but you kept your nerve, till cunning saved you from the cave; you thought that you would die there.  so his heart held firm and constant, but he writhed around, as when a man rotates a sausage full of fat and blood; the huge fire blazes, and he longs to have the roasting finished. so he squirmed, this way and that, and wondered how he could attack the shameless suitors, being one against a multitude. athena came

From heaven and stood near him, at his head, resembling a woman, and she said,  why are you wide awake, unlucky man? this is your house, this is your wife inside, and your own child, the son you hoped to have.  clever odysseus said,  goddess, yes, all that is true. but i am wondering how i can attack those upstarts, who are always clustered together, while i am alone. my biggest fear is this: if you and zeus

Help me to kill them, then what? where can i run to escape my punishment? you tell me!  with glinting eyes athena said,  so stubborn! most men trust friends even weaker, mortal friends, whose judgment is far worse than mine. i am a goddess, and throughout your many trials, i have watched over you. if we were ambushed, surrounded by not one but fifty gangs of men who hoped to murder us you would escape, and even poach their sheep and cows.

Now go to sleep. to stay on guard awake all night is tiring. quite soon you will distance yourself, odysseus, from trouble.  with that, the goddess drenched his eyes with sleep, then flew back to olympus. sleep took hold, relaxed him, and released him from his worries. meanwhile, his faithful wife was wide awake, crying and sitting upright on her bed against soft pillows. when her sobs subsided, she prayed.  o artemis! majestic goddess!

Daughter of zeus! if only you would shoot an arrow in my heart and kill me now, or let a gust of wind take hold of me and carry me across the misty clouds and fling me where the waters of the ocean pour forth and back again, as when the breezes took up the daughters of pandareus, after the gods destroyed their parents, leaving the daughters orphaned. aphrodite helped them, and gave them honey, cheese, and mellow wine,

And hera gave them beauty and good sense, above all other women; artemis increased their height; athena taught them how to be most skillful in all handiwork. then aphrodite went to mount olympus to ask zeus, thunderlord, to grant the girls good marriages he knows all things, all fates, both good and bad. but harpies seized and forced them to serve the cruel furies. may the gods annihilate me just like them! or may

Artemis strike me dead, with my gaze fixed upon odysseus! let me not make a lesser husband glad. when someone weeps all through the day quite overwhelmed by grief, but sleeps at night, forgetting everything, her pain is bearable. but i am cursed with nightmares by some god. last night, a man was sleeping by me, just like him when he marched off to war. my heart was cheered; it seemed a vision, not a dream.  as she said this,

The golden dawn arrived. odysseus heard his wife weeping, and became confused; he thought that she was standing by his head, and that she had already recognized him. he took the cloak and fleece with which he slept, and put them on a chair inside the palace, and took the oxhide outside to the courtyard, then raised his arms and prayed.  o father zeus! o gods! if you have brought me back on purpose across dry land and sea to my own home,

After you made me suffer all that pain, let someone inside speak in words of omen, and zeus, display another sign outside.  zeus, lord of cunning, heard him, and he thundered from bright olympus, high above the clouds; odysseus was happy. then a woman, a wheat grinder, inside the house nearby, spoke words of omen. twelve slaves worked the mills to grind the wheat and barley for the king. the rest had finished and had gone to sleep.

The weakest one was still at work. she paused her mill, and spoke he heard it as an omen.  zeus, king of gods and humans! you made thunder boom from a cloudless sky a sign for someone. fulfill a poor slave s prayer: that this will be the last day that the suitors dine in style here in the old king s house. my knees are sore from this exhausting work of grinding grain for them. i pray this is their final meal!  this sign and zeus  thunder made her master

Glad, and more certain he would get revenge on those who did him wrong. the other women gathered and lit a fire in the hearth. godlike telemachus got out of bed and dressed, and slung his sword across his back. he tied his sandals on his well-oiled feet, and took his sharp and sturdy bronze-tipped spear. standing across the threshold, he called out to eurycleia.  nanny! did you women make sure our guest was honored, with a meal

And comfortable bed? or did he lie there neglected? this is typical of mother! she may be clever, but she acts on whims! she treats unwanted guests with great respect, and rudely sends the better ones away.  the nurse said tactfully,  child, do not blame her, not now. he drank some wine, and chose a chair. he said he had already had his dinner  she asked him. and at bedtime, she brought out a cot, so that the girls could make his bed.

Poor destitute old man! he would not take nice bedding. he slept outside on the porch, on oxhide and a fleece; we spread a cloak on top of him.  telemachus marched off out of the palace, with his sword in hand, accompanied by two swift dogs, and went down to the meeting place of the achaeans. then noble eurycleia, child of ops, called to the slaves.  now hurry! you girls sweep the floors and sprinkle them. spread purple cloths

Across the chairs. you others, sponge the tables, and wash the double-handled cups and bowls. and you, go fetch the water from the spring. be quick! they will be coming soon; it is a festival for all of them today.  they listened carefully and followed orders. twenty ran off to fetch the dark spring water; the other well-trained slaves were working hard

Around the house. the able-bodied men came in and chopped the wood. they knew their work. the women got back from the spring, and with them the swineherd came with three fat pigs his best. he penned them in the yard to root around, and kindly asked odysseus,  my friend, are they now treating you with more respect, or still abusing you, just as before?  odysseus, the cunning strategist, replied,  eumaeus, may the gods avenge these upstarts for their wickedness and schemes! the scoundrels have abused me in a house

Which is not theirs! they show no shame!  while they were talking in this way, melanthius arrived with two more herders. they were driving the very fattest she-goats from the flock  a contribution to the suitors  banquet. he tied the goats up on the portico, and started picking on odysseus.  stranger! are you still here, still causing trouble, with begging and annoying those inside? i promise you a beating if you stay!

Your begging is not welcome! this is not the only place in greece where there is food.  inscrutable odysseus said nothing; he bowed his head in silence, contemplating his murderous plans. the third and final herdsman, philoetius, an overseer, came herding fat he-goats and an uncalved heifer, brought by a ferryman to ithaca  the ferries also carry passengers when anybody needs to get across.

Philoetius tied up his animals outside, and asked the swineherd,  who is this new guest who has arrived? who are his people? where is his native land? his ancestry? poor man, he has a kingly look; his bearing is like a lord s. when gods spin threads of pain, even great kings are made to wander far and suffer greatly.  then he shook his hand and greeted him.  good morning, sir! you are down on your luck; i hope things change for you.

No god is more destructive, zeus, than you! you are the father of humanity, but you do not take pity on our pain. my eyes are wet, my skin is damp with sweat, as i think of odysseus. if he still lives and sees the sun, he must be lost, and dressed in rags like these. or if he has already died, oh, lord odysseus! i am so sorry! he entrusted me with my first herd when i was just a boy,

In cephallenia. his cattle now are countless; they would not have multiplied so well for someone else. but now these men are telling me to drive the cows to them for food. they do not care about the boy, or tremble at the eyes of watchful gods. my master has been gone a long time now. they want to share his wealth among themselves, and i keep turning over in my mind that it would not be right to take the cows

And go to foreign lands, when master s son is here. but it is worse to sit and suffer, just taking care of other people s cattle. i would have run away and gone to serve another king; things are unbearable. but i keep hoping my unlucky master will come back from wherever he may be and scatter all these suitors in his halls.  crafty odysseus replied,  i see you are intelligent. so i will swear

A solemn oath to you. i vow by zeus, and hospitality, and by this hearth, that while you are still here, odysseus will come back home, and if you want, you can watch as the boys who swagger here are killed.  the cowherd answered,  stranger, may zeus make your words come true and you would see my strength, and how prepared my hands would be to fight.  eumaeus also prayed to all the gods to bring his many-minded master home.

As they were talking in this way, the suitors were planning how to kill telemachus. but then an eagle flew high on their left, holding a wild dove. amphinomus said to them,  friends, this plan of ours, this murder, will fail. so let us think about our banquet.  they all agreed, and went inside the house of godlike king odysseus. they spread cloths on the chairs and sofas, and they killed large sheep, fat goats, big pigs, and one tame cow.

They cooked the innards and divided them, and mixed the wine in bowls; the swineherd poured it into the cups. philoetius served bread in baskets, and melanthius passed round the wine. they helped themselves to all the food. then thinking carefully, telemachus seated odysseus inside the hall, beside the stony threshold, and he brought a table and a stool. he served him meat and poured a gold cup full of wine, and said,

 now you are sitting here and drinking wine among them. i will stop them touching you or mocking you. this is no public house! odysseus acquired it for me. and you there, suitors! please, no blows or insults. we do not want to start an argument.  they bit their lips, surprised to hear the boy speaking so boldly, and antinous, eupeithes  son, declared,  my lords, we must accept the threats telemachus has made,

Annoying though they are. zeus would not let us kill him or else by now we could have stopped his speechifying in our banquet hall.  telemachus ignored him, and meanwhile, the house boys drove one hundred animals through town for sacrifice. the ithacans assembled at apollo s shady grove  the lord of archery. inside the house, the suitors cooked the meat kebabs, took out the skewers, then divided up the portions 

A splendid feast. they served odysseus an equal portion with their own; his son, telemachus, had ordered them to do so. but still athena would not let the suitors refrain from hurtful insults and abuse, so even deeper bitterness would sink into the heart of great odysseus. one lawless man from same named ctesippus, encouraged by extraordinary wealth, had come to court odysseus  wife

Because he had been absent for so long. he shouted to the other reckless suitors,  listen! this stranger got an equal share, as is appropriate. it would, of course, be wrong to disrespect a guest who comes to visit our telemachus. let me give him a welcome gift, so he can give gifts to the bath attendant or some other house slave here in the palace.  then he grabbed an ox-foot from the basket, and he hurled it

Towards odysseus, who smoothly ducked, bowing his head, and smiled in scornful rage. the ox-foot struck the wall. telemachus scolded ctesippus.  you were very lucky you failed to hit the stranger; he avoided the blow himself. i would have thrust my sword right through your belly, and your father would have held your funeral, and not your wedding. so from now on, you all should stay in check, here in my house. i used to be a child,

But now i understand things, good and bad. i have to watch and put up with all this: the slaughtered sheep, the food, the wine. it is hard for a single man to put a stop to such a multitude. but please back down from your hostility to me. or if you do still want to kill me with bronze swords, go on; i want you to. it would be better to die, than have to watch you suitors acting so horribly abusing strangers, dragging

The house girls through my home, molesting them.  they all fell silent. agelaus spoke.  my friends, his words are fair. do not get angry or argue back with him. do not abuse the stranger, or odysseus  slaves. telemachus, i offer some advice to you and to your mother, with respect. i hope you can accept it. while you thought your many-minded father would come home, there was no harm in holding us at bay,

And waiting, in case he came back again. now it is obvious he will not come. so boy, sit by your mother, and advise her to choose the best, most generous of us to marry; then you can enjoy the wealth left by your father, eat and drink, and she can go take care of someone else s house.  telemachus inhaled, then answered,  yes! by zeus and by my father s sufferings  lost far from ithaca, or maybe dead 

I will cause no delay, and i will tell her to pick a husband, and i will provide a lavish dowry. but i am reluctant to force her if she does not want to go. may no god make that happen!  so he spoke. athena turned the suitors  minds; they laughed unstoppably. they cackled, and they lost control of their own faces. plates of meat began to drip with blood. their eyes were full of tears, and they began to wail in grief.

The prophet theoclymenus addressed them.  what awful thing is happening to you? your faces, heads, and bodies are wrapped up in night; your screams are blazing out like fire. the ornate palace ceilings and the walls are spattered with your blood. the porch is full of ghosts, as is the courtyard ghosts descending into the dark of erebus. the sun has vanished from the sky, and gloomy mist is all around.  at these words, they all laughed.

Eurymachus spoke up.  this new arrival has lost his mind! quick, fellows, throw him out! make him go to the marketplace he thinks it is like night in here!  the prophet answered,  eurymachus, i will not ask for guides. i have good eyes and ears and feet; my mind is working perfectly, and i am leaving. i sense some evil coming for you all, who sit here in odysseus  house tormenting and oppressing other people.

Not one of you will get away.  with that, he left the palace and went down to meet piraeus, and was welcomed there. the suitors, with glances at each other, tried to tease telemachus by laughing at his guests.  what awful luck you have with visitors! here is this dirty beggar, always wanting more food and wine, who is unskilled in farmwork or fighting a mere burden on the earth! that other one just stood there prophesying!

Now listen i propose a better plan. pack up your strangers on a boat as slaves; send them to sicily, and make a profit!  telemachus ignored the suitors  words, and watched his father quietly, still waiting for when they should attack the shameless suitors. the beautiful penelope had wisely set up her chair to face them, and she listened to what each man was saying. they had killed numerous animals, and made their banquet

With laughter. but no dinnertime could be less welcome than the one the mighty man and goddess would soon bring them, in revenge, because they started it and wronged him first.",the last banquet odysseus was lying at the entrance on an untreated oxhide  over which he heaped a pile of fleeces from the sheep the suitors sacrificed  eurynome spread a thick blanket over him  he lay there but did not sleep  his mind was plotting how to kill the suitors  then the girls who had been sleeping with suitors slipped outside  giggling and happy to be out together  his heart was roused to rage  he wondered whether  to jump at them and slaughter every one  or let them have one very final night with those proud suitors and his heart was barking  just as a mother dog will stand astride her little puppies  bristling to fight  if she sees any man she does not know  so his heart growled inside him  he was shocked at their behavior  he slapped his chest and told himself   be strong  my heart  you were hounded by worse the day the cyclops ate  your strong companions  but you kept your nerve  till cunning saved you from the cave  you thought that you would die there   so his heart held firm and constant  but he writhed around  as when a man rotates a sausage full of fat and blood  the huge fire blazes  and he longs to have the roasting finished  so he squirmed  this way and that  and wondered how he could attack the shameless suitors  being one against a multitude  athena came  from heaven and stood near him  at his head  resembling a woman  and she said   why are you wide awake  unlucky man  this is your house  this is your wife inside  and your own child  the son you hoped to have   clever odysseus said   goddess  yes  all that is true  but i am wondering how i can attack those upstarts  who are always clustered together  while i am alone  my biggest fear is this  if you and zeus  help me to kill them  then what  where can i run to escape my punishment  you tell me   with glinting eyes athena said   so stubborn  most men trust friends even weaker  mortal friends  whose judgment is far worse than mine  i am a goddess  and throughout your many trials  i have watched over you  if we were ambushed  surrounded by not one but fifty gangs of men who hoped to murder us you would escape  and even poach their sheep and cows   now go to sleep  to stay on guard awake all night is tiring  quite soon you will distance yourself  odysseus  from trouble   with that  the goddess drenched his eyes with sleep  then flew back to olympus  sleep took hold  relaxed him  and released him from his worries  meanwhile  his faithful wife was wide awake  crying and sitting upright on her bed against soft pillows  when her sobs subsided  she prayed   o artemis  majestic goddess   daughter of zeus  if only you would shoot an arrow in my heart and kill me now  or let a gust of wind take hold of me and carry me across the misty clouds and fling me where the waters of the ocean pour forth and back again  as when the breezes took up the daughters of pandareus  after the gods destroyed their parents  leaving the daughters orphaned  aphrodite helped them  and gave them honey  cheese  and mellow wine   and hera gave them beauty and good sense  above all other women  artemis increased their height  athena taught them how to be most skillful in all handiwork  then aphrodite went to mount olympus to ask zeus  thunderlord  to grant the girls good marriages he knows all things  all fates  both good and bad  but harpies seized and forced them to serve the cruel furies  may the gods annihilate me just like them  or may  artemis strike me dead  with my gaze fixed upon odysseus  let me not make a lesser husband glad  when someone weeps all through the day quite overwhelmed by grief  but sleeps at night  forgetting everything  her pain is bearable  but i am cursed with nightmares by some god  last night  a man was sleeping by me  just like him when he marched off to war  my heart was cheered  it seemed a vision  not a dream   as she said this   the golden dawn arrived  odysseus heard his wife weeping  and became confused  he thought that she was standing by his head  and that she had already recognized him  he took the cloak and fleece with which he slept  and put them on a chair inside the palace  and took the oxhide outside to the courtyard  then raised his arms and prayed   o father zeus  o gods  if you have brought me back on purpose across dry land and sea to my own home   after you made me suffer all that pain  let someone inside speak in words of omen  and zeus  display another sign outside   zeus  lord of cunning  heard him  and he thundered from bright olympus  high above the clouds  odysseus was happy  then a woman  a wheat grinder  inside the house nearby  spoke words of omen  twelve slaves worked the mills to grind the wheat and barley for the king  the rest had finished and had gone to sleep   the weakest one was still at work  she paused her mill  and spoke he heard it as an omen   zeus  king of gods and humans  you made thunder boom from a cloudless sky a sign for someone  fulfill a poor slave s prayer  that this will be the last day that the suitors dine in style here in the old king s house  my knees are sore from this exhausting work of grinding grain for them  i pray this is their final meal   this sign and zeus  thunder made her master  glad  and more certain he would get revenge on those who did him wrong  the other women gathered and lit a fire in the hearth  godlike telemachus got out of bed and dressed  and slung his sword across his back  he tied his sandals on his well oiled feet  and took his sharp and sturdy bronze tipped spear  standing across the threshold  he called out to eurycleia   nanny  did you women make sure our guest was honored  with a meal  and comfortable bed  or did he lie there neglected  this is typical of mother  she may be clever  but she acts on whims  she treats unwanted guests with great respect  and rudely sends the better ones away   the nurse said tactfully   child  do not blame her  not now  he drank some wine  and chose a chair  he said he had already had his dinner  she asked him  and at bedtime  she brought out a cot  so that the girls could make his bed   poor destitute old man  he would not take nice bedding  he slept outside on the porch  on oxhide and a fleece  we spread a cloak on top of him   telemachus marched off out of the palace  with his sword in hand  accompanied by two swift dogs  and went down to the meeting place of the achaeans  then noble eurycleia  child of ops  called to the slaves   now hurry  you girls sweep the floors and sprinkle them  spread purple cloths  across the chairs  you others  sponge the tables  and wash the double handled cups and bowls  and you  go fetch the water from the spring  be quick  they will be coming soon  it is a festival for all of them today   they listened carefully and followed orders  twenty ran off to fetch the dark spring water  the other well trained slaves were working hard  around the house  the able bodied men came in and chopped the wood  they knew their work  the women got back from the spring  and with them the swineherd came with three fat pigs his best  he penned them in the yard to root around  and kindly asked odysseus   my friend  are they now treating you with more respect  or still abusing you  just as before   odysseus  the cunning strategist  replied   eumaeus  may the gods avenge these upstarts for their wickedness and schemes  the scoundrels have abused me in a house  which is not theirs  they show no shame   while they were talking in this way  melanthius arrived with two more herders  they were driving the very fattest she goats from the flock  a contribution to the suitors  banquet  he tied the goats up on the portico  and started picking on odysseus   stranger  are you still here  still causing trouble  with begging and annoying those inside  i promise you a beating if you stay   your begging is not welcome  this is not the only place in greece where there is food   inscrutable odysseus said nothing  he bowed his head in silence  contemplating his murderous plans  the third and final herdsman  philoetius  an overseer  came herding fat he goats and an uncalved heifer  brought by a ferryman to ithaca  the ferries also carry passengers when anybody needs to get across   philoetius tied up his animals outside  and asked the swineherd   who is this new guest who has arrived  who are his people  where is his native land  his ancestry  poor man  he has a kingly look  his bearing is like a lord s  when gods spin threads of pain  even great kings are made to wander far and suffer greatly   then he shook his hand and greeted him   good morning  sir  you are down on your luck  i hope things change for you   no god is more destructive  zeus  than you  you are the father of humanity  but you do not take pity on our pain  my eyes are wet  my skin is damp with sweat  as i think of odysseus  if he still lives and sees the sun  he must be lost  and dressed in rags like these  or if he has already died  oh  lord odysseus  i am so sorry  he entrusted me with my first herd when i was just a boy   in cephallenia  his cattle now are countless  they would not have multiplied so well for someone else  but now these men are telling me to drive the cows to them for food  they do not care about the boy  or tremble at the eyes of watchful gods  my master has been gone a long time now  they want to share his wealth among themselves  and i keep turning over in my mind that it would not be right to take the cows  and go to foreign lands  when master s son is here  but it is worse to sit and suffer  just taking care of other people s cattle  i would have run away and gone to serve another king  things are unbearable  but i keep hoping my unlucky master will come back from wherever he may be and scatter all these suitors in his halls   crafty odysseus replied   i see you are intelligent  so i will swear  a solemn oath to you  i vow by zeus  and hospitality  and by this hearth  that while you are still here  odysseus will come back home  and if you want  you can watch as the boys who swagger here are killed   the cowherd answered   stranger  may zeus make your words come true and you would see my strength  and how prepared my hands would be to fight   eumaeus also prayed to all the gods to bring his many minded master home   as they were talking in this way  the suitors were planning how to kill telemachus  but then an eagle flew high on their left  holding a wild dove  amphinomus said to them   friends  this plan of ours  this murder  will fail  so let us think about our banquet   they all agreed  and went inside the house of godlike king odysseus  they spread cloths on the chairs and sofas  and they killed large sheep  fat goats  big pigs  and one tame cow   they cooked the innards and divided them  and mixed the wine in bowls  the swineherd poured it into the cups  philoetius served bread in baskets  and melanthius passed round the wine  they helped themselves to all the food  then thinking carefully  telemachus seated odysseus inside the hall  beside the stony threshold  and he brought a table and a stool  he served him meat and poured a gold cup full of wine  and said    now you are sitting here and drinking wine among them  i will stop them touching you or mocking you  this is no public house  odysseus acquired it for me  and you there  suitors  please  no blows or insults  we do not want to start an argument   they bit their lips  surprised to hear the boy speaking so boldly  and antinous  eupeithes  son  declared   my lords  we must accept the threats telemachus has made   annoying though they are  zeus would not let us kill him or else by now we could have stopped his speechifying in our banquet hall   telemachus ignored him  and meanwhile  the house boys drove one hundred animals through town for sacrifice  the ithacans assembled at apollo s shady grove  the lord of archery  inside the house  the suitors cooked the meat kebabs  took out the

20,20,5824,5938,6052,"

An archery contest with glinting eyes, athena put a thought into the mind of wise penelope, the daughter of icarius: to place the bow and iron axes in the hall of great odysseus, and set the contest which would begin the slaughter. she went up to her own room. her muscular, firm hand picked up the ivory handle of the key  a hook of bronze. then with her slaves she walked down to the storeroom where the master kept

His treasure: gold and bronze and well-wrought iron. the curving bow and deadly arrows lay there, given by iphitus, eurytus  son, the godlike man he happened to befriend at wise ortilochus  house, far off in lacedaemon, in messenia. odysseus had gone to claim a debt  some people of messenia had come in rowing boats and poached three hundred sheep from ithaca; they took their shepherds too.

Laertes and the other older men had sent odysseus to fetch them back when he was still a boy. and iphitus had come there for his horses, twelve fine mares, each suckling a sturdy mule. these horses would later cause his death, when he had gone to visit heracles, who welcomed him, but killed him, so that he could take the horses  betraying hospitality, and heedless about the watchful gods. before all that,

When iphitus first met odysseus, he gave this bow to him, inherited from his own father. and odysseus gave iphitus a sword and spear, to mark their bond. but iphitus was dead before the friends could visit one another s houses. so when odysseus  black fleet sailed to war, he did not take the bow, but stored it in his own house, to use in ithaca in memory of his friend. the queen had reached

The storeroom, and she stepped across the threshold of polished oak; a skillful carpenter had set it level, fixed the frame, and built the dazzling double doors. she quickly loosed the door-thong from its hook, pushed in the key and with true aim, thrust back the fastenings. the fine doors, as the key struck home, began to bellow as a bull at pasture bellows. at once, they flew apart. she stepped inside, onto the pallet where the scented clothes

Were stored in chests, and reached to lift the bow down from its hook, still in its shining case. she sat down on the floor to take it out, resting it on her lap, and started sobbing and wailing as she saw her husband s bow. at last, she dried her eyes, and in her arms picked up the curving bow and quiver, packed with many deadly arrows, and she went to meet her arrogant suitors. slaves lugged out a hamper with their master s many axes

Of bronze and iron, for the competition. the queen came near the suitors, and she stopped beside a pillar with a filmy veil across her face. two slave girls stood with her. she said,  now listen, lords. you keep on coming to this house every day, to eat and drink, wasting the wealth of someone who has been away too long. your motives are no secret. you want to marry me. i am the prize. so i will set a contest. this great bow

Belonged to godlike king odysseus. if anyone can grasp it in his hands and string it easily, and shoot through all twelve axes, i will marry him, and leave this beautiful rich house, so full of life, my lovely bridal home. i think i will remember it forever, even in my dreams.  she told eumaeus he should set the bow and pale-gray iron axes up before the suitors, and in tears the swineherd

Took them, and did as she had asked. the cowherd wept also when he saw his master s bow. antinous began to scold and taunt them. he said,  you idiots! you tactless peasants! so thoughtless, so undisciplined! you fools, your selfish crying is upsetting her! poor lady, she is sad enough already at losing her beloved husband. sit and eat in silence, or go do your wailing outside, and leave us suitors here to try

The deadly contest of the bow. i think it will be difficult; not one of us can match odysseus. i saw him once in childhood, and i still remember him.  he hoped he would be first to string the bow and shoot through all the axes. but he would be first to taste an arrow from the hands of great odysseus, whom he had mocked, urging the others on to do the same. then prince telemachus addressed them all.

 zeus must have made me stupid! my dear mother, despite her usual common sense, has said that she will marry someone else and leave this house. but i am laughing, and my heart feels foolish gladness. well, come on, you suitors. you want this prize a woman unlike any in holy pylos, argos or mycenae, or here in ithaca or on the mainland. no woman in achaea is like her. there is no need for me to praise my mother.

You know her worth. so do not make excuses, do not put off the contest of the bow. we want to watch. and i will try myself. if i succeed in stringing it and shooting all through, i will no longer mind if mother goes off with someone else, and leaves me here. success would prove me man enough to carry my father s arms.  he stood up straight and tall, tossed off his purple cloak, unstrapped his sword, and dug a trench to set the axes up,

All in a line, and trod the earth down flat. they were amazed to see him work so neatly, though he had never seen it done before. he stood astride the threshold and began to try the bow. three times his muscles trembled, straining to draw it back; three times he failed to string the bow and shoot all through the axes. he would have tried a fourth time; he was keen to keep on pulling. but odysseus shook his head, stopping him. telemachus

Said,  ugh! it seems that i will always be too weak and useless. or perhaps i am too young and inexperienced at fighting in self-defense when someone starts a quarrel. you all are stronger than i am. you try, and we can end the contest.  with these words, he set the bow down on the floor, propped up against the polished, jointed double door, and tucked the arrow up against the handle. he sat back down where he had sat before.

Antinous called out,  now, friends, get up, from left to right, beginning with the man next to the wine-slave!  they agreed. the first was leodes, their holy man, who always sat in the farthest corner, by the wine-bowl. he was the only one who disapproved of all their bullying. he grasped the bow and stood astride the threshold, and he tried to string it, but he failed. his hands were soft, untrained by labor, and he grew worn out

Trying to pull it back. he told the suitors,  my friends, i cannot do it. someone else should have a turn. this bow will take away courage, life-force, and energy from many noble young men; but better we should die, than live and lose the goal for which we gather in this house every day. each man still hopes for marriage with odysseus  wife, penelope. but if one tries and fails to string the bow, let him go use his wealth

To court some other fine, well-dressed greek lady. and after that, penelope will marry whichever man can bring most gifts for her  the man whom fate has chosen.  with these words, he set the bow back down, and leaned it up against the polished, jointed double door, tucking the pointed arrow by the handle. antinous responded with a jeer.  my goodness, leodes! what scary words! all your tough talk has made me really angry.

You cannot string the bow, so you are claiming that it will take the life from proper men. you surely were not born for archery. the rest of us are actual warriors; we will soon string this bow.  he told the goatherd,  melanthius, come on now, light a fire and pull a chair beside it, with a fleece, and bring out from the pantry a big hunk of fat, so we young men can warm the bow, grease it, and try it, and so end this contest. 

Melanthius obeyed at once; he lit a blazing fire, and pulled a chair beside it, spreading a fleece on top, and brought the wheel of fat. the young men warmed the bow, but still they could not string it. they were far too weak. antinous and eurymachus, the leaders, strongest and most impressive of the suitors, had still not had their turn. meanwhile the swineherd and cowherd had both gone outside the house. odysseus himself came after them,

And when they were outside the gates, beyond the courtyard, in a friendly voice he said,  cowherd and swineherd, i am hesitating whether to speak out openly; my impulse is to be frank. what if some god should guide odysseus, and suddenly, as if from nowhere, he was here how would you act? would you be with the suitors, or with him? how are your hearts inclined?  the cowherd said,  o father zeus, please make this wish come true,

That he may come! may spirits guide him home! then you would see how well-prepared i am to fight for him!  eumaeus prayed in turn that all the gods would bring odysseus back home. the man who thought of everything now knew their minds, and said to them,  i am here now. i suffered terribly for twenty years, and now i have come back to my own land. i see that you two are the only slaves who welcome my arrival. i have not

Heard any others praying i would come back to my home. i promise, if some god brings down the noble suitors by my hands, i will give each of you a wife and wealth, and well-constructed houses, near my own. you two will be telemachus  brothers. now let me show you clearer proof, so you can know me well and trust me. see my scar, made by the boar s white tusk, when i had gone to hunt on mount parnassus with my cousins. 

So saying, he pulled back his rags and showed the great big scar. they stared and studied it, then both burst into tears. they threw their arms around odysseus, and kissed his face and hugged him, overjoyed at seeing him. odysseus embraced them back and kissed them. they would have wept till sunset, but he stopped them, and said,  stop now; if someone steps outside and sees you crying, they may tell the men. go in, not both at once but taking turns,

First me, then you, then you. and this will be our sign: when all the noblemen refuse to let me have the bow and set of arrows, then you must bring them through the hall, eumaeus, and put them in my hands. command the women to shut up tight the entrance to the hall, and go to their own quarters; if they hear men screaming or loud noises, they must not come out, but stay there quietly, and work. and you, philoetius, lock up the gates

Leading out from the courtyard with the bolt and put the rope on too. we must move fast.  with that, he went inside, and sat back down on the same chair he sat on earlier. then the two slaves went in. eurymachus was handling the bow and warming it, turning it back and forth beside the fire. but even after that, he could not manage to string it, and he groaned, and yelled in fury,  this is disastrous! for all of us!

I do not even mind so much about the marriage. there are lots of other women on ithaca, and in the other cities. but that we should be proven so much weaker than king odysseus, that we should fail to string his bow! our deep humiliation will be well-known for many years to come!  antinous said,  no, eurymachus, it will not be like that, as you well know. no one should shoot a bow today; it is

A feast day for apollo! we should sit calmly and leave the axe heads standing there. no one will come and take them. let the boy pour wine, so we can make drink offerings, and leave the bow for now. at dawn, call back melanthius, to bring the finest goats, so we can make our offerings to the god, apollo, lord of archery, then try the bow again, and finish up the contest.  they all agreed with him. attendants poured

Water to wash their hands, and boys began to mix the wine in bowls, and poured a serving in every cup, so they could make libations and drink. odysseus, the lord of lies, had carefully considered how to fool them. he said,  now hear me, suitors of the queen; let me reveal the promptings of my heart. eurymachus and lord antinous, i ask you specially, because you spoke so well: now set the bow aside, and turn

Towards the gods. at dawn, the god will choose the victor and give him success. for now, give me the polished bow, so i can try my strength and find out if my hands still have the suppleness and vigor of my youth, or if it has been lost in all my years of homelessness and poverty.  they bristled, nervous in case he strung the polished bow. antinous said,  foreigner! you fool! are you not grateful that we let you stay here

And eat with noblemen like us, and share our feast, and hear us talk? no other beggars can hear our conversation. this good wine has made you drunk. it does have that effect on those who gulp and fail to pace themselves. wine even turned the famous centaur s head. when eurytion visited the lapiths, inside the house of brave pirithous the wine made him go crazy, and he did terrible things. the warriors were outraged,

And dragged him from the house. their ruthless swords cut off his ears and cropped his nose right off. he wandered, still insane and blown about by gusts of madness. from that day, the centaurs and humans have been enemies. his drinking was harmful to himself. if you should string that bow, it would be worse for you. no man will treat you kindly in our house. we will send you by ship to echetus, the king of cruelty; you will find no escape.

Sit quietly, drink up, and do not quarrel with younger men.  astute penelope said,  no, antinous, it is not right to disrespect a guest telemachus has welcomed to this house. and do you think that if this stranger s hands were strong enough to string the bow, he would take me away to marry him and live with him? of course not! he does not even dream of such a thing. no need to spoil the feast by worrying

About such things; there is no need of that.  eurymachus said,  shrewd penelope, it is indeed unlikely that this man would marry you. but we would feel ashamed if some rude person said,  those men are weak! they court a fighter s wife, but cannot string his bow! some random beggar has shown up and strung it easily, and shot right through all of the axes!  they will talk like that, and we will be humiliated!  calmly,

Penelope replied,  eurymachus, people who waste the riches of a king have lost their dignity. why fuss at this? the stranger is quite tall and muscular; his father must be noble. go on, give him the bow, and let us watch. i tell you, if he strings it by the blessing of apollo, i will give him a proper cloak and tunic, fine clothes and sandals, and a two-edged sword and dagger, sharp enough to ward away

Both men and dogs, and i will help him go wherever he desires to go.  with quick intake of breath, telemachus replied,  no, mother, no one has a better right than i to give the bow to anyone or to refuse it. no one on this island or out towards the pasturelands of elis, and no man in this house can force my hand, even if i should choose to give the bow to him to take away. go up and work

With loom and distaff; tell your girls the same. the bow is work for men, especially me. i am the one with power in this house.  she was amazed, and went back to her room, taking to heart her son s assertive words. inside her bedroom with her girls, she wept for her dear husband, her odysseus, until clear-eyed athena let her sleep. meanwhile, the swineherd lifted up the bow. the suitors made an uproar.  dirty pig-man!

Where are you taking it? are you insane? the dogs you raised yourself will eat you up when you are out there with your pigs alone, if we find favor with apollo and the other deathless gods.  he was afraid, because there were so many people shouting inside the hall, and set the bow he carried down on the ground. telemachus called out, in forceful tones.  no, grandpa! keep on going! keep carrying the bow! you will soon see

You have to choose which master to obey. though i am younger than you, i am stronger; watch out, or i will chase you to the fields, pelting your back with stones. i wish i had an equal edge on all those who invaded my home to court my mother and make mischief. i would soon throw them out and make them pay!  at that, the suitors all began to laugh; their anger at telemachus was gone. eumaeus went across the hall and gave

The bow to competent odysseus. and then he summoned eurycleia, saying,  telemachus gave orders you must lock the doors into the hall and tie them fast. if any of you women hear a noise of screaming men, stay up there in your quarters; do not come out; keep quiet and keep working.  at that, she held her tongue and locked the doors that led into the feast-hall. philoetius scurried outside to bolt the outer gates

That led into the courtyard. on the porch lay a fresh-knotted cable made of byblos; with that, he tied the gates, rushed in and sat back down, and looked towards odysseus. the master was already handling the bow and turning it this way and that, to see if worms had eaten at the horn while he was gone. the suitors told each other,  he stares at it as if he were an expert in bows. he acts the part! perhaps he has

A bow like this at home or plans to make one. see how this pitiful migrant fingers it!  one confident young suitor said,  i hope his future luck will match how well he does in stringing it!  so he had tricked them all. after examining the mighty bow carefully, inch by inch as easily as an experienced musician stretches a sheep-gut string around a lyre s peg and makes it fast odysseus, with ease,

Strung the great bow. he held it in his right hand and plucked the string, which sang like swallow-song, a clear sweet note. the suitors, horrified, grew pale, and zeus made ominous thunder rumble. odysseus, who had so long been waiting, was glad to hear the signal from the son of double-dealing cronus. he took up an arrow, which was lying on the table. the others were all packed up in the quiver, soon to be used. he laid it on the bridge,

Then pulled the notch-end and the string together, still sitting in his chair. with careful aim, he shot. the weighted tip of bronze flew through each axe head and then out the other side. he told his son,  telemachus, your guest does you a credit. i hit all the targets and with no effort strung the bow. i am still strong, despite their jibes about my weakness. though it is daytime, it is time to feast; and later, we can celebrate with music,

The joyful part of dinner.  with his eyebrows he signaled, and his son strapped on his sword, picked up his spear, and stood beside his chair, next to his father, his bronze weapons flashing.",an archery contest with glinting eyes  athena put a thought into the mind of wise penelope  the daughter of icarius  to place the bow and iron axes in the hall of great odysseus  and set the contest which would begin the slaughter  she went up to her own room  her muscular  firm hand picked up the ivory handle of the key  a hook of bronze  then with her slaves she walked down to the storeroom where the master kept  his treasure  gold and bronze and well wrought iron  the curving bow and deadly arrows lay there  given by iphitus  eurytus  son  the godlike man he happened to befriend at wise ortilochus  house  far off in lacedaemon  in messenia  odysseus had gone to claim a debt  some people of messenia had come in rowing boats and poached three hundred sheep from ithaca  they took their shepherds too   laertes and the other older men had sent odysseus to fetch them back when he was still a boy  and iphitus had come there for his horses  twelve fine mares  each suckling a sturdy mule  these horses would later because his death  when he had gone to visit heracles  who welcomed him  but killed him  so that he could take the horses  betraying hospitality  and heedless about the watchful gods  before all that   when iphitus first met odysseus  he gave this bow to him  inherited from his own father  and odysseus gave iphitus a sword and spear  to mark their bond  but iphitus was dead before the friends could visit one another s houses  so when odysseus  black fleet sailed to war  he did not take the bow  but stored it in his own house  to use in ithaca in memory of his friend  the queen had reached  the storeroom  and she stepped across the threshold of polished oak  a skillful carpenter had set it level  fixed the frame  and built the dazzling double doors  she quickly loosed the door thong from its hook  pushed in the key and with true aim  thrust back the fastenings  the fine doors  as the key struck home  began to bellow as a bull at pasture bellows  at once  they flew apart  she stepped inside  onto the pallet where the scented clothes  were stored in chests  and reached to lift the bow down from its hook  still in its shining case  she sat down on the floor to take it out  resting it on her lap  and started sobbing and wailing as she saw her husband s bow  at last  she dried her eyes  and in her arms picked up the curving bow and quiver  packed with many deadly arrows  and she went to meet her arrogant suitors  slaves lugged out a hamper with their master s many axes  of bronze and iron  for the competition  the queen came near the suitors  and she stopped beside a pillar with a filmy veil across her face  two slave girls stood with her  she said   now listen  lords  you keep on coming to this house every day  to eat and drink  wasting the wealth of someone who has been away too long  your motives are no secret  you want to marry me  i am the prize  so i will set a contest  this great bow  belonged to godlike king odysseus  if anyone can grasp it in his hands and string it easily  and shoot through all twelve axes  i will marry him  and leave this beautiful rich house  so full of life  my lovely bridal home  i think i will remember it forever  even in my dreams   she told eumaeus he should set the bow and pale gray iron axes up before the suitors  and in tears the swineherd  took them  and did as she had asked  the cowherd wept also when he saw his master s bow  antinous began to scold and taunt them  he said   you idiots  you tactless peasants  so thoughtless  so undisciplined  you fools  your selfish crying is upsetting her  poor lady  she is sad enough already at losing her beloved husband  sit and eat in silence  or go do your wailing outside  and leave us suitors here to try  the deadly contest of the bow  i think it will be difficult  not one of us can match odysseus  i saw him once in childhood  and i still remember him   he hoped he would be first to string the bow and shoot through all the axes  but he would be first to taste an arrow from the hands of great odysseus  whom he had mocked  urging the others on to do the same  then prince telemachus addressed them all    zeus must have made me stupid  my dear mother  despite her usual common sense  has said that she will marry someone else and leave this house  but i am laughing  and my heart feels foolish gladness  well  come on  you suitors  you want this prize a woman unlike any in holy pylos  argos or mycenae  or here in ithaca or on the mainland  no woman in achaea is like her  there is no need for me to praise my mother   you know her worth  so do not make excuses  do not put off the contest of the bow  we want to watch  and i will try myself  if i succeed in stringing it and shooting all through  i will no longer mind if mother goes off with someone else  and leaves me here  success would prove me man enough to carry my father s arms   he stood up straight and tall  tossed off his purple cloak  unstrapped his sword  and dug a trench to set the axes up   all in a line  and trod the earth down flat  they were amazed to see him work so neatly  though he had never seen it done before  he stood astride the threshold and began to try the bow  three times his muscles trembled  straining to draw it back  three times he failed to string the bow and shoot all through the axes  he would have tried a fourth time  he was keen to keep on pulling  but odysseus shook his head  stopping him  telemachus  said   ugh  it seems that i will always be too weak and useless  or perhaps i am too young and inexperienced at fighting in self defense when someone starts a quarrel  you all are stronger than i am  you try  and we can end the contest   with these words  he set the bow down on the floor  propped up against the polished  jointed double door  and tucked the arrow up against the handle  he sat back down where he had sat before   antinous called out   now  friends  get up  from left to right  beginning with the man next to the wine slave   they agreed  the first was leodes  their holy man  who always sat in the farthest corner  by the wine bowl  he was the only one who disapproved of all their bullying  he grasped the bow and stood astride the threshold  and he tried to string it  but he failed  his hands were soft  untrained by labor  and he grew worn out  trying to pull it back  he told the suitors   my friends  i cannot do it  someone else should have a turn  this bow will take away courage  life force  and energy from many noble young men  but better we should die  than live and lose the goal for which we gather in this house every day  each man still hopes for marriage with odysseus  wife  penelope  but if one tries and fails to string the bow  let him go use his wealth  to court some other fine  well dressed greek lady  and after that  penelope will marry whichever man can bring most gifts for her  the man whom fate has chosen   with these words  he set the bow back down  and leaned it up against the polished  jointed double door  tucking the pointed arrow by the handle  antinous responded with a jeer   my goodness  leodes  what scary words  all your tough talk has made me really angry   you cannot string the bow  so you are claiming that it will take the life from proper men  you surely were not born for archery  the rest of us are actual warriors  we will soon string this bow   he told the goatherd   melanthius  come on now  light a fire and pull a chair beside it  with a fleece  and bring out from the pantry a big hunk of fat  so we young men can warm the bow  grease it  and try it  and so end this contest    melanthius obeyed at once  he lit a blazing fire  and pulled a chair beside it  spreading a fleece on top  and brought the wheel of fat  the young men warmed

21,21,6053,6185,6318,"

Bloodshed odysseus ripped off his rags. now naked, he leapt upon the threshold with his bow and quiverfull of arrows, which he tipped out in a rush before his feet, and spoke.  playtime is over. i will shoot again, towards another mark no man has hit. apollo, may i manage it!  he aimed his deadly arrow at antinous. the young man sat there, just about to lift his golden goblet, swirling wine around,

Ready to drink. he had no thought of death. how could he? who would think a single man, among so many banqueters, would dare to risk dark death, however strong he was? odysseus aimed at his throat, then shot. the point pierced all the way through his soft neck. he flopped down to the side and his cup slipped out of his hand, and then thick streams of blood gushed from his nostrils. his foot twitched and knocked the table down; food scattered on the ground.

The bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood. seeing him fall, the suitors, in an uproar, with shouts that filled the hall, jumped up and rushed to search around by all the thick stone walls for shields or swords to grab but there were none. they angrily rebuked odysseus.  stranger, you shot a man, and you will pay! you will join no more games you have to die! for certain! you have killed the best young man in all of ithaca. right here, the vultures

Will eat your corpse.  those poor fools did not know that he had killed antinous on purpose, nor that the snares of death were round them all. clever odysseus scowled back and sneered,  dogs! so you thought i would not come back home from troy? and so you fleeced my house, and raped my slave girls, and you flirted with my wife while i am still alive! you did not fear the gods who live in heaven, and you thought no man would ever come to take revenge.

Now you are trapped inside the snares of death.  at that, pale fear seized all of them. they groped to find a way to save their lives somehow. only eurymachus found words to answer.  if it is you, odysseus, come back, then we agree! quite right, the greeks have done outrageous things to your estate and home. but now the one responsible is dead  antinous! it was all his idea. he did not even really want your wife,

But had another plan, which zeus has foiled: to lie in ambush for your son, and kill him, then seize the throne and rule in ithaca. now he is slain quite rightly. please, my lord, have mercy on your people! we will pay in public, yes, for all the food and drink. we each will bring the price of twenty oxen, and pay you all the gold and bronze you want. your anger is quite understandable.  odysseus saw through him; with a glare

He told him,  even if you give me all your whole inheritance, and even more, i will not keep my hands away from slaughter until i pay you suitors back for all your wickedness. you have two choices: fight, or run away: just try to save your lives! not one of you will get away from death.  at that their knees grew weak, their hearts stopped still. eurymachus again addressed the suitors.  my friends, this man will not hold back his hands.

Seizing the bow and arrows, he will shoot us right from that polished threshold, till he kills each one of us. be quick, make plans for battle. draw out your swords, use tables as your shields against the deadly arrows. all together, rush at him, try to drive him off the threshold, and out of doors, then run all through the town, and quickly call for help. this man will soon have shot his last!  he drew his sharp bronze sword and with a dreadful scream he leapt at him.

But that same instant, lord odysseus let fly and hit his chest, beside the nipple, and instantly the arrow pierced his liver. the sword fell from his hand. he doubled up and fell across the table, spilling food and wine across the floor. he smashed his head against the ground, and in his desperate pain kicked up the chair, and darkness drenched his eyes. amphinomus attacked odysseus. he drew his sharp sword, hoping he could force him

To yield his place. telemachus leapt in and thrust his bronze spear through him from behind, ramming it through his back and out his chest. face-first he crashed and thudded to the ground. telemachus dashed back he left his spear stuck in the body; he was terrified that if he bent to pull it out, some greek would jump on him and stab him with a sword. he ran and quickly reached his loyal father. he stood beside him and his words flew out.

 now father, i will fetch a shield for you and two spears and a helmet made of bronze, and i will arm myself, and bring more arms for our two herdsmen, since we all need weapons.  odysseus, the master planner, answered,  run fast while i still have a stock of arrows, before they force me from the doors i am fighting alone up here.  his son obeyed. he hurried to the storeroom for the arms, and took eight spears, four shields, and four bronze helmets

Each fitted out with bushy horsehair plumes. he hurried back to take them to his father, and was the first to strap the armor on. the two slaves also armed themselves, and stood flanking their brilliant, resourceful leader. as long as he had arrows, he kept shooting, and one by one he picked the suitors off, inside his own home. then at last the king ran out of arrows; he set down his bow next to the sturdy doorpost, leaning up

Against the palace walls, all shining white. he slung the four-fold shield across his shoulders, and put the well-made helmet on his head. the crest of horsehair gave a fearsome nod. he grasped a bronze-tipped spear in either hand. there was a back gate in the castle walls, providing access to the passageway, with tightly fitted doors. odysseus ordered the noble swineherd to stand there to guard it there was only one way out.

Agelaus called out to all the suitors.  friends, one of us should slip out through that gate and quickly tell the people, raise alarms. that soon would put a stop to this man s shooting.  melanthius the goatherd answered,  no! my lord, that entryway is much too narrow, and dangerously near the palace doors. one man, if he was brave, could keep it guarded against us all. so i will bring you armor out of the storeroom, which i think is where

Those two, our enemies, have hidden it.  melanthius the goatherd climbed up past the arrow-slits inside the castle walls, into the chamber. there he took twelve shields, twelve spears and twelve bronze helmets, each one crested with horsehair. then he hurried back downstairs and handed all the weapons to the suitors. odysseus could see that they had arms; their spears were brandished. his heart stopped, his legs trembled he was so shocked at their presumption.

At once his words flew out to tell his son,  one of the women, or melanthius, is waging war against us, in my house!  wisely telemachus owned up at once.  father, it was my fault, i am to blame. i left the heavy storeroom door ajar. someone on their side must have kept good watch. go there, eumaeus, shut the door, and see if any of the women are against us, or else, as i suspect, melanthius. 

Meanwhile, melanthius was going back to get more weapons from the room. the swineherd saw him and told odysseus,  my lord, that little sneak, the man we all suspected, is going to the stores! odysseus, you always have a plan for what to do: so should i kill him, as i think is best, or bring him here to you, so you can punish his many crimes against you in your house?  odysseus already had a plan.

 telemachus and i will keep the suitors trapped in the hall however much they rage. you two, truss up his hands and feet behind him, drag him inside the storeroom, string him up, tying a knotted rope high on the column, and hoist him to the rafters. torture him with hours of agony before he dies.  his word was their command; they hurried off, and reached the weaponry. melanthius was unaware of them. as he was searching

For arms, they stopped on each side of the door and waited. when he stepped across the threshold, holding a lovely helmet in one hand, and in the other hand, a rusty shield, once carried by laertes in his youth, but now in storage, with its seams all loose. the two men jumped on him and grabbed his hair to drag him in and threw him on the floor, shaking with fear. they bound his hands and feet and yanked them painfully behind his back,

Just as the lord of suffering had told them. they tied him with a knotted rope and hoisted his body up the column to the rafters. swineherd eumaeus, you began to mock him:  keep watch the whole night through, melanthius, tucked up in this soft bed it serves you right! and wait there for the golden throne of dawn leaving the sea, that hour when you would lead your goats to this house for the suitors  dinner.  there he was left, bound cruelly and stretched.

The herdsmen armed themselves and left the room, shutting the door, and joined their cunning leader. they stood there on the threshold, tense with purpose, just four against so many men inside. the child of zeus, athena, came to meet them; her voice and looks resembled those of mentor. odysseus was happy when he saw her, and said,  remember our old friendship, mentor! i have been good to you since we were boys. so help me now!  he guessed it was athena,

Who rouses armies. from the hall, the suitors shouted their opposition. agelaus called,  mentor, do not let odysseus sway you to help him and to fight against us. i think this is how things will go. when we have killed this father and his son, you will die also, if you do as you intend, and pay with your own life for all your plots. our bronze will strip your life away from you, and we will seize whatever you may own

And mix it with the loot we get from here. your sons will not survive here in these halls, nor will your wife and daughters still walk free in ithaca.  at that athena s heart became enraged, and angrily she scolded odysseus.  where is your courage now? you fought nine years on end against the trojans, for white-armed helen, zeus  favorite child. you slaughtered many men when war was raging, and formed the plan that made the city fall.

Now you are home at last, how can you flinch from being brave and using proper force against these suitors? come now, stand by me and watch how mentor, son of alcimus, will treat your enemies as recompense for all your service.  but she did not grant decisive victory; she kept on testing odysseus  courage, and his son s. she flew up like a swallow through the smoke and nestled in the rafters of the roof.

Now agelaus, demoptolemus, eurynomus, pisander, amphimedon, and polybus were urging on the suitors. those were the most heroic of the group who still survived and battled for their lives: the others were defeated by the bow and raining arrows. agelaus told them,  that mentor s boasts were empty, friends! he left, and they are all alone there at the entrance. now force this cruel man to stay his hands.

Do not hurl spears at him all in a mass, but you six must shoot first and pray lord zeus we strike odysseus and win the fight. once he is down, the others will be nothing.  the six men threw their spears as he had said; at once athena made their efforts fail. one pierced the doorpost of the palace hall, another hit the closely fitted door, another s spear of ash and heavy bronze fell on the wall. the group of four avoided

All of the suitors  spears. odysseus had waited long enough.  my friends,  he said,  they want to slaughter us and strip our arms! avenge my former wrongs, and save your lives! now shoot!  they hurled their spears at once and hit. odysseus killed demoptolemus; telemachus, euryades; the swineherd slaughtered elatus, and the cowherd killed pisander. they all fell and bit the earth. the other suitors huddled in a corner;

The four rushed up and from the corpses pulled their spears. again the suitors threw their weapons; again athena made them fail. one spear struck at the doorpost, and another pierced the door; another ash spear hit the wall. amphimedon s blow grazed telemachus right by the wrist: the bronze tore through his skin. ctesippus hurled his spear; it only scratched the swineherd s shoulder, just above his shield, flew past and fell down on the floor behind him.

The competent, sharp-eyed odysseus and his companions hurled their piercing spears into the swarming throng. the city-sacker skewered eurydamas; telemachus slashed amphimedon, and the swineherd struck at polybus; the cowherd sliced right through ctesippus  chest, and crowed,  you fool! you loved insulting us now you have stopped your boasting. the gods have got the last word; they have won. this is a gift to pay you for that kick

You gave odysseus when he walked through his own house, as a homeless man in need.  odysseus moved closer with his spear, and pierced agelaus; telemachus thrust at leocritus, and drove his bronze into his belly. he fell down headfirst, face smashed against the floor. then from the roof athena lifted high her deadly aegis. the frightened suitors bolted through the hall like cattle, roused and driven by a gadfly

In springtime, when the days are getting longer. as vultures with their crooked beaks and talons swoop from the hills and pounce on smaller birds that fly across the fields beneath the clouds; the victims have no help and no way out, as their attackers slaughter them, and men watch and enjoy the violence. so these four fighters sprang and struck, and drove the suitors in all directions. screaming filled the hall, as skulls were cracked; the whole floor ran with blood.

Leodes darted up to supplicate odysseus; he touched his knees.  please, mercy! i did no wrong, i swear, in word or deed to any of the women in the house. i tried to stop the suitors, tried to urge them to keep their hands clean, but they would not listen. those fools deserved their fate. but i did nothing! i am a priest yet i must lie with them. will good behavior go unrewarded?  the calculating hero scowled at him.

 if, as you claim, you sacrificed for them, you must have often prayed here in my hall that i would not regain the joys of home, and that my wife would marry you instead, and bear you children. you will not escape. suffer and die!  agelaus had dropped his sword when he was killed. with his strong arm odysseus swung, slashed down and sliced right through the priest s neck, and his head, still framing words, rolled in the dust. the poet phemius,

Who had been forced to sing to please the suitors, was huddling by the back door with his lyre, anxiously considering his choices: to slip outside and crouch beneath the altar of mighty zeus, the god of home owners, where his old masters burned so many thigh-bones; or he could run towards odysseus and grasp him by the knees and beg for mercy. he made his mind up: he would supplicate. he set his hollow lyre on the ground

Between the mixing bowl and silver chair, and dashed to take odysseus  knees, beseeching him in quivering winged words.  i beg you, lord odysseus! have mercy! think! if you kill me now, you will be sorry! i have the power to sing for gods and men. i am self-taught all kinds of song are planted by gods inside my heart. i am prepared to sing for you, as if before a god. wait, do not cut my throat! just ask your son!

He will explain it was against my will that i came here to sing to them after dinner. they were too fierce and they outnumbered me. i had no choice.  then strong telemachus turned quickly to his father, saying,  stop, hold up your sword this man is innocent. and let us also save the house boy, medon. he always cared for me when i was young  unless the herdsmen have already killed him, or he already met you in your rage. 

Medon was sensible: he had been hiding under a chair, beneath a fresh cowhide, in order to escape from being killed. hearing these words, he jumped up from the chair, took off the cowhide and assumed the pose of supplication near telemachus, and said,  friend, here i am! please spare my life! your father is too strong, and furious against the suitors, who skimmed off his wealth and failed to honor you. please, talk to him! 

Canny odysseus smiled down and said,  you need not worry, he has saved your life. so live and spread the word that doing good is far superior to wickedness. now leave the hall and go outside; sit down, joining the famous singer in the courtyard, so i can finish what i have to do inside my house.  the two men went outside, and crouched by zeus  altar, on the lookout for death at any moment all around.

Odysseus scanned all around his home for any man who might be still alive, who might be hiding to escape destruction. he saw them fallen, all of them, so many, lying in blood and dust, like fish hauled up out of the dark-gray sea in fine-mesh nets; tipped out upon the curving beach s sand, they gasp for water from the salty sea. so lay the suitors, heaped across each other. odysseus, still scheming, told his son,

 i need to say something to eurycleia. hurry, telemachus, and bring her here.  telemachus was glad to please his father. he pushed the door ajar and called the nurse.  nanny, come quick! you have been here for years. you supervise the female palace slaves. my father has to talk to you; come on!  she had no words to answer him, but opened the doors into the great and sturdy hall. telemachus went first and led the way.

Among the corpses of the slaughtered men she saw odysseus all smeared with blood. after a lion eats a grazing ox, its chest and jowls are thick with blood all over; a dreadful sight. just so, odysseus had blood all over him from hands to feet. seeing the corpses, seeing all that blood, so great a deed of violence, she began to crow. odysseus told her to stop and spoke with fluent words.  old woman, no!

Be glad inside your heart, but do not shout. it is not pious, gloating over men who have been killed. divine fate took them down, and their own wicked deeds. they disrespected all people that they met, both bad and good. through their own crimes they came to this bad end. but tell me now about the household women. which ones dishonor me? and which are pure?  the slave who loved her master answered,  child, i will tell you exactly how things stand.

In this house we have fifty female slaves whom we have trained to work, to card the wool, and taught to tolerate their life as slaves. twelve stepped away from honor: those twelve girls ignore me, and penelope our mistress. she would not let telemachus instruct them, since he is young and only just grown-up. let me go upstairs to the women s rooms, to tell your wife some god has sent her sleep.  the master strategist odysseus

Said,  not yet; do not wake her. call the women who made those treasonous plots while i was gone.  the old nurse did so. walking through the hall, she called the girls. meanwhile, odysseus summoned the herdsmen and telemachus and spoke winged words to them.  now we must start to clear the corpses out. the girls must help. then clean my stately chairs and handsome tables with sponges fine as honeycomb, and water. when the whole house is set in proper order,

Restore my halls to health: take out the girls between the courtyard wall and the rotunda. hack at them with long swords, eradicate all life from them. they will forget the things the suitors made them do with them in secret, through aphrodite.  sobbing desperately the girls came, weeping, clutching at each other. they carried out the bodies of the dead and piled them up on top of one another, under the roof outside. odysseus

Instructed them and forced them to continue. and then they cleaned his lovely chairs and tables with wet absorbent sponges, while the prince and herdsmen with their shovels scraped away the mess to make the sturdy floor all clean. the girls picked up the trash and took it out. the men created order in the house and set it all to rights, then led the girls outside and trapped them they could not escape  between the courtyard wall and the rotunda.

Showing initiative, telemachus insisted,  i refuse to grant these girls a clean death, since they poured down shame on me and mother, when they lay beside the suitors.  at that, he wound a piece of sailor s rope round the rotunda and round the mighty pillar, stretched up so high no foot could touch the ground. as doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly home to their nests, but someone sets a trap  they crash into a net, a bitter bedtime;

Just so the girls, their heads all in a row, were strung up with the noose around their necks to make their death an agony. they gasped, feet twitching for a while, but not for long. then the men took melanthius outside and with curved bronze cut off his nose and ears and ripped away his genitals, to feed raw to the dogs. still full of rage, they chopped his hands and feet off. then they washed their own, and they went back inside. odysseus

Told his beloved nurse,  now bring me fire and sulfur, as a cure for evil things, and i will fumigate the house. and call penelope, her slaves, and all the slave girls inside the house.  she answered with affection,  yes, dear, all this is good. but let me bring a cloak and shirt for you. you should not stand here your strong back covered only with those rags. that would be wrong!  odysseus, the master of every cunning scheme, replied,  no, first

I need a fire here, to smoke the hall.  his loving slave complied and brought the fire and sulfur, and odysseus made smoke, and fumigated every room inside the house and yard. meanwhile, the old nurse ran all through the palace summoning the women. by torchlight they came out from their apartments, to greet odysseus with open arms. they kissed his face and took him by the hands in welcome. he was seized by sweet desire

To weep, and in his heart he knew them all.",bloodshed odysseus ripped off his rags  now naked  he leapt upon the threshold with his bow and quiverfull of arrows  which he tipped out in a rush before his feet  and spoke   playtime is over  i will shoot again  towards another mark no man has hit  apollo  may i manage it   he aimed his deadly arrow at antinous  the young man sat there  just about to

however much they rage  you two  truss up his hands and feet behind him  drag him inside the storeroom  string him up  tying a knotted rope high on the column  and hoist him to the rafters  torture him with hours of agony before he dies   his word was their command  they hurried off  and reached the weaponry  melanthius was unaware of them  as he was searching  for arms  they stopped on each side of the door and waited  when he stepped across the threshold  holding a lovely helmet in one hand  and in the other hand  a rusty shield  once carried by laertes in his youth  but now in storage  with its seams all loose  the two men jumped on him and grabbed his hair to drag him in and threw him on the floor  shaking with fear  they bound his hands and feet and yanked them painfully behind his back   just as the lord of suffering had told them  they tied him with a knotted rope and hoisted his body up the column to the rafters  swineherd eumaeus  you began to mock him   keep watch the whole night through  melanthius  tucked up in this soft bed it serves you right  and wait there for the golden throne of dawn leaving the sea  that hour when you would lead your goats to this house for the suitors  dinner   there he was left  bound cruelly and stretched   the herdsmen armed themselves and left the room  shutting the door  and joined their cunning leader  they stood there on the threshold  tense with purpose  just four against so many men inside  the child of zeus  athena  came to meet them  her voice and looks resembled those of mentor  odysseus was happy when he saw her  and said   remember our old friendship  mentor  i have been good to you since we were boys  so help me now   he guessed it was athena   who rouses armies  from the hall  the suitors shouted their opposition  agelaus called   mentor  do not let odysseus sway you to help him and to fight against us  i think this is how things will go  when we have killed this father and his son  you will die also  if you do as you intend  and pay with your own life for all your plots  our bronze will strip your life away from you  and we will seize whatever you may own  and mix it with the loot we get from here  your sons will not survive here in these halls  nor will your wife and daughters still walk free in ithaca   at that athena s heart became enraged  and angrily she scolded odysseus   where is your courage now  you fought nine years on end against the trojans  for white armed helen  zeus  favorite child  you slaughtered many men when war was raging  and formed the plan that made the city fall   now you are home at last  how can you flinch from being brave and using proper force against these suitors  come now  stand by me and watch how mentor  son of alcimus  will treat your enemies as recompense for all your service   but she did not grant decisive victory  she kept on testing odysseus  courage  and his son s  she flew up like a swallow through the smoke and nestled in the rafters of the roof   now agelaus  demoptolemus  eurynomus  pisander  amphimedon  and polybus were urging on the suitors  those were the most heroic of the group who still survived and battled for their lives  the others were defeated by the bow and raining arrows  agelaus told them   that mentor s boasts were empty  friends  he left  and they are all alone there at the entrance  now force this cruel man to stay his hands   do not hurl spears at him all in a mass  but you six must shoot first and pray lord zeus we strike odysseus and win the fight  once he is down  the others will be nothing   the six men threw their spears as he had said  at once athena made their efforts fail  one pierced the doorpost of the palace hall  another hit the closely fitted door  another s spear of ash and heavy bronze fell on the wall  the group of four avoided  all of the suitors  spears  odysseus had waited long enough   my friends   he said   they want to slaughter us and strip our arms  avenge my former wrongs  and save your lives  now shoot   they hurled their spears at once and hit  odysseus killed demoptolemus  telemachus  euryades  the swineherd slaughtered elatus  and the cowherd killed pisander  they all fell and bit the earth  the other suitors huddled in a corner   the four rushed up and from the corpses pulled their spears  again the suitors threw their weapons  again athena made them fail  one spear struck at the doorpost  and another pierced the door  another ash spear hit the wall  amphimedon s blow grazed telemachus right by the wrist  the bronze tore through his skin  ctesippus hurled his spear  it only scratched the swineherd s shoulder  just above his shield  flew past and fell down on the floor behind him   the competent  sharp eyed odysseus and his companions hurled their piercing spears into the swarming throng  the city sacker skewered eurydamas  telemachus slashed amphimedon  and the swineherd struck at polybus  the cowherd sliced right through ctesippus  chest  and crowed   you fool  you loved insulting us now you have stopped your boasting  the gods have got the last word  they have won  this is a gift to pay you for that kick  you gave odysseus when he walked through his own house  as a homeless man in need   odysseus moved closer with his spear  and pierced agelaus  telemachus thrust at leocritus  and drove his bronze into his belly  he fell down headfirst  face smashed against the floor  then from the roof athena lifted high her deadly aegis  the frightened suitors bolted through the hall like cattle  roused and driven by a gadfly  in springtime  when the days are getting longer  as vultures with their crooked beaks and talons swoop from the hills and pounce on smaller birds that fly across the fields beneath the clouds  the victims have no help and no way out  as their attackers slaughter them  and men watch and enjoy the violence  so these four fighters sprang and struck  and drove the suitors in all directions  screaming filled the hall  as skulls were cracked  the whole floor ran with blood   leodes darted up to supplicate odysseus  he touched his knees   please  mercy  i did no wrong  i swear  in word or deed to any of the women in the house  i tried to stop the suitors  tried to urge them to keep their hands clean  but they would not listen  those fools deserved their fate  but i did nothing  i am a priest yet i must lie with them  will good behavior go unrewarded   the calculating hero scowled at him    if  as you claim  you sacrificed for them  you must have often prayed here in my hall that i would not regain the joys of home  and that my wife would marry you instead  and bear you children  you will not escape  suffer and die   agelaus had dropped his sword when he was killed  with his strong arm odysseus swung  slashed down and sliced right through the priest s neck  and his head  still framing words  rolled in the dust  the poet phemius   who had been forced to sing to please the suitors  was huddling by the back door with his lyre  anxiously considering his choices  to slip outside and crouch beneath the altar of mighty zeus  the god of home owners  where his old masters burned so many thigh bones  or he could run towards odysseus and grasp him by the knees and beg for mercy  he made his mind up  he would supplicate  he set his hollow lyre on the ground  between the mixing bowl and silver chair  and dashed to take odysseus  knees  beseeching him in quivering winged words   i beg you  lord odysseus  have mercy  think  if you kill me now  you will be sorry  i have the power to sing for gods and men  i am self taught all kinds of song are planted by gods inside my heart  i am prepared to sing for you  as if before a god  wait  do not cut my throat  just ask your son   he will explain it was against my will that i came here to sing to them after dinner  they were too fierce and they outnumbered me  i had no choice   then strong telemachus turned quickly to his father  saying   stop  hold up your sword this man is innocent  and let us also save the house boy  medon  he always cared for me when i was young  unless the herdsmen have already killed him  or he already met you in your rage    medon was sensible  he had been hiding under a chair  beneath a fresh cowhide  in order to escape from being killed  hearing these words  he jumped up from the chair  took off the cowhide and assumed the pose of supplication near telemachus  and said   friend  here i am  please spare my life  your father is too strong  and furious against the suitors  who skimmed off his wealth and failed to honor you  please  talk to him    canny odysseus smiled down and said   you need not worry  he has saved your life  so live and spread the word that doing good is far superior to wickedness  now leave the hall and go outside  sit down  joining the famous singer in the courtyard  so i can finish what i have to do inside my house   the two men went outside  and crouched by zeus  altar  on the lookout for death at any moment all around   odysseus scanned all around his home for any man who might be still alive  who might be hiding to escape destruction  he saw them fallen  all of them  so many  lying in blood and dust  like fish hauled up out of the dark gray sea in fine mesh nets  tipped out upon the curving beach s sand  they gasp for water from the salty sea  so lay the suitors  heaped across each other  odysseus  still scheming  told his son    i need to say something to eurycleia  hurry  telemachus  and bring her here   telemachus was glad to please his father  he pushed the door ajar and called the nurse   nanny  come quick  you have been here for years  you supervise the female palace slaves  my father has to talk to you  come on   she had no words to answer him  but opened the doors into the great and sturdy hall  telemachus went first and led the way   among the corpses of the slaughtered men she saw odysseus all smeared with blood  after a lion eats a grazing ox  its chest and jowls are thick with blood all over  a dreadful sight  just so  odysseus had blood all over him from hands to feet  seeing the corpses  seeing all that blood  so great a deed of violence  she began to crow  odysseus told her to stop and spoke with fluent words   old woman  no   be glad inside your heart  but do not shout  it is not pious  gloating over men who have been killed  divine fate took them down  and their own wicked deeds  they disrespected all people that they met  both bad and good  through their own crimes they came to this bad end  but tell me now about the household women  which ones dishonor me  and which are pure   the slave who loved her master answered   child  i will tell you exactly how things stand   in this house we have fifty female slaves whom we have trained to work  to card the wool  and taught to tolerate their life as slaves  twelve stepped away from honor  those twelve girls ignore me  and penelope our mistress  she would not let telemachus instruct them  since he is young and only just grown up  let me go upstairs to the women s rooms  to tell your wife some god has sent her sleep   the master strategist odysseus  said   not yet  do not wake her  call the women who made those treasonous plots while i was gone   the old nurse did so  walking through the hall  she called the girls  meanwhile  odysseus summoned the herdsmen and telemachus and spoke winged words to them   now we must start to clear the corpses out  the girls must help  then clean my stately chairs and handsome tables with sponges fine as honeycomb  and water  when the whole house is set in proper order   restore my halls to health  take out the girls between the courtyard wall and the rotunda  hack at them with long swords  eradicate all life from them  they will forget the things the suitors made them do with them in secret  through aphrodite   sobbing desperately the girls came  weeping  clutching at each other  they carried out the bodies of the dead and piled them up on top of one another  under the roof outside  odysseus  instructed them and forced them to continue  and then they cleaned his lovely chairs and tables with wet absorbent sponges  while the prince and herdsmen with their shovels scraped away the mess to make the sturdy floor all clean  the girls picked up the trash and took it out  the men created order in the house and set it all to rights  then led the girls outside and trapped them they could not escape  between the courtyard wall and the rotunda   showing initiative  telemachus insisted   i refuse to grant these girls a clean death  since they poured down shame on me and mother  when they lay beside the suitors   at that  he wound a piece of sailor s rope round the rotunda and round the mighty pillar  stretched up so high no foot could touch the ground  as doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly home to their nests  but someone sets a trap  they crash into a net  a bitter bedtime   just so the girls  their heads all in a row  were strung up with the noose around their necks to make their death an agony  they gasped  feet twitching for a while  but not for long  then the men took melanthius outside and with curved bronze cut off his nose and ears and ripped away his genitals  to feed raw to the dogs  still full of rage  they chopped his hands and feet off  then they washed their own  and they went back inside  odysseus  told his beloved nurse   now bring me fire and sulfur  as a cure for evil things  and i will fumigate the house  and call penelope  her slaves  and all the slave girls inside the house   she answered with affection   yes  dear  all this is good  but let me bring a cloak and shirt for you  you should not stand here your strong back covered only with those rags  that would be wrong   odysseus  the master of every cunning scheme  replied   no  first  i need a fire here  to smoke the hall   his loving slave complied and brought the fire and sulfur  and odysseus made smoke  and fumigated every room inside the house and yard  meanwhile  the old nurse ran all through the palace summoning the women  by torchlight they came out from their apartments  to greet odysseus with open arms  they kissed his face and took him by the hands in welcome  he was seized by sweet desire  to weep  and in his heart he knew them

22,22,6319,6412,6506,"

The olive tree bed chuckling with glee, the old slave climbed upstairs to tell the queen that her beloved husband was home. her weak old knees felt stronger now; with buoyant steps she went and stood beside her mistress, at her head, and said,  dear child, wake up and see! at long last you have got your wish come true! odysseus has come! he is right here inside this house! at last! he slaughtered all the suitors who were wasting his property and threatening his son! 

But cautiously penelope replied,  you poor old thing! the gods have made you crazy. they have the power to turn the sanest person mad, or make fools turn wise. you used to be so sensible, but they have damaged you. why else would you be mocking me like this, with silly stories, in my time of grief? why did you wake me from the sleep that sweetly wrapped round my eyes? i have not slept so soundly since my odysseus marched off to see

That cursed town evilium. go back! if any other slave comes here to wake me and tell me all this nonsense, i will send her back down at once, and i will not be gentle. your old age will protect you from worse scolding.  but eurycleia answered with affection,  dear child, i am not mocking you. i am telling the truth: odysseus is here! he is the stranger that they all abused. telemachus has known for quite some time,

But sensibly he kept his father s plans a secret, so odysseus could take revenge for all their violence and pride.  penelope was overjoyed; she jumped from bed and hugged the nurse, and started crying. her words flew fast.  dear nanny! if this is the truth, if he has come back to this house, how could he have attacked those shameless suitors, when he is just one man, and there were always so many crowded in there?  eurycleia

Answered,  i did not see or learn the details. i heard the sound of screaming from the men as they were killed. we huddled in our room and kept the doors tight shut, until your son called me his father sent him. then i saw odysseus surrounded by dead bodies. they lay on top of one another, sprawled across the solid floor. you would have been thrilled if you saw him, like a lion, drenched in blood and gore. now they are all piled up

Out by the courtyard gates, and he is burning a mighty fire to fumigate the palace, restoring all its loveliness. he sent me to fetch you. come with me, so both of you can start to live in happiness. you have endured such misery. your wish came true! he is alive! he has come home again, and found you and your son, and he has taken revenge on all the suitors who abused him.  penelope said carefully,  do not

Start gloating. as you know, my son and i would be delighted if he came. we all would. however, what you say cannot be true. some god has killed the suitors out of anger at their abuse of power and their pride. they failed to show respect to visitors, both good and bad. their foolishness has killed them. but my odysseus has lost his home, and far away from greece, he lost his life.  the nurse replied,  dear child! how can you say

Your husband will not come, when he is here, beside the hearth? your heart has always been mistrustful. but i have clear evidence! when i was washing him, i felt the scar made when the boar impaled him with its tusk. i tried to tell you, but he grabbed my throat and stopped me spoiling all his plans. come with me. i swear on my own life: if i am lying, then kill me.  wise penelope said,  nanny, it must be hard for you to understand

The ways of gods, despite your cleverness. but let us go to meet my son, so i can see the suitors dead, and see the man who killed them.  so she went downstairs. her heart could not decide if she should keep her distance as she was questioning her own dear husband, or go right up to him and kiss his face and hold his hands in hers. she crossed the threshold and sat across from him beside the wall, in firelight. he sat beside the pillar,

And kept his eyes down, waiting to find out whether the woman who once shared his bed would speak to him. she sat in silence, stunned. sometimes when she was glancing at his face it seemed like him; but then his dirty clothes were unfamiliar. telemachus scolded her.  mother! cruel, heartless mother! why are you doing this, rejecting father? why do you not go over, sit beside him, and talk to him? no woman in the world

Would be so obstinate! to keep your distance from him when he has come back after twenty long years of suffering! your heart is always harder than rock!  but thoughtfully she answered,  my child, i am confused. i cannot speak, or meet his eyes. if this is really him, if my odysseus has come back home, we have our ways to recognize each other, through secret signs known only to us two.  hardened odysseus began to smile.

He told the boy,  you must allow your mother to test me out; she will soon know me better. while i am dirty, dressed in rags, she will not treat me with kindness or acknowledge me. meanwhile, we must make plans. if someone murders even just one man, even one who had few friends in his community, the killer is forced to run away and leave his homeland and family. but we have killed the mainstay of ithaca, the island s best young men.

So what do you suggest?  telemachus said warily,  you have to work it out. they say you have the finest mind in all the world; no mortal man can rival you in cleverness. lead me, and i will be behind you right away. and i will do my best to be as brave as i can be.  odysseus was quick to form a plan. he told him,  here is what i think is best. the three of you should wash and change your clothes,

And make the slave girls go put on clean dresses. then let the godlike singer take the lyre and play a clear and cheerful dancing tune, so passersby or neighbors hearing it will think it is a wedding. we must not allow the news about the suitors  murder to spread too far until we reach the woods of our estate, and there we can decide the best path forward offered us by zeus.  they did as lord odysseus had said.

They washed and changed their tunics, and the slave girls prepared themselves. the singer took the lyre, and roused in them desire to hear sweet music, and dance. the house resounded with the thump of beating feet from all the dancing men and girls in pretty sashes. those outside who heard the noises said to one another,  so somebody is marrying the queen who had so many suitors! headstrong woman! she must have lacked the strength to wait it out

And keep her husband s house safe till he came.  they spoke with no idea what really happened. eurynome the slave woman began to wash strong-willed odysseus. she rubbed him with olive oil, and dressed him in a tunic and handsome cloak. and then athena poured attractiveness from head to toe, and made him taller and stronger, and his hair grew thick and curly as a hyacinth. as when a craftsman whom athena or hephaestus

Has trained in metalwork, so he can make beautiful artifacts, pours gold on silver  so she poured beauty on his head and shoulders. after his bath he looked like an immortal. he sat down in the same chair opposite his wife and said,  extraordinary woman! the gods have given you the hardest heart. no other wife would so reject a husband who had been suffering for twenty years and finally come home. well, nanny, make

A bed for me, so i can rest. this woman must have an iron heart!  penelope said shrewdly,  you extraordinary man! i am not acting proud, or underplaying this big event; yet i am not surprised at how you look. you looked like this the day your long oars sailed away from ithaca. now, eurycleia, make the bed for him outside the room he built himself. pull out the bedstead, and spread quilts and blankets on it. 

She spoke to test him, and odysseus was furious, and told his loyal wife,  woman! your words have cut my heart! who moved my bed? it would be difficult for even a master craftsman though a god could do it with ease. no man, however young and strong, could pry it out. there is a trick to how this bed was made. i made it, no one else. inside the court there grew an olive tree with delicate long leaves, full-grown and green,

As sturdy as a pillar, and i built the room around it. i packed stones together, and fixed a roof and fitted doors. at last i trimmed the olive tree and used my bronze to cut the branches off from root to tip and planed it down and skillfully transformed the trunk into a bedpost. with a drill, i bored right through it. this was my first bedpost, and then i made the other three, inlaid with gold and silver and with ivory.

I stretched ox-leather straps across, dyed purple. now i have told the secret trick, the token. but woman, wife, i do not know if someone  a man has cut the olive trunk and moved my bed, or if it is still safe.  at that, her heart and body suddenly relaxed. she recognized the tokens he had shown her. she burst out crying and ran straight towards him and threw her arms around him, kissed his face, and said,  do not be angry at me now,

Odysseus! in every other way you are a very understanding man. the gods have made us suffer: they refused to let us stay together and enjoy our youth until we reached the edge of age together. please forgive me, do not keep bearing a grudge because when i first saw you, i would not welcome you immediately. i felt a constant dread that some bad man would fool me with his lies. there are so many

Dishonest, clever men. that foreigner would never have got helen into bed, if she had known the greeks would march to war and bring her home again. it was a goddess who made her do it, putting in her heart the passion that first caused my grief as well. now you have told the story of our bed, the secret that no other mortal knows, except yourself and me, and just one slave, actoris, whom my father gave to me

When i came here, who used to guard our room. you made my stubborn heart believe in you.  this made him want to cry. he held his love, his faithful wife, and wept. as welcome as the land to swimmers, when poseidon wrecks their ship at sea and breaks it with great waves and driving winds; a few escape the sea and reach the shore, their skin all caked with brine. grateful to be alive, they crawl to land. so glad she was to see her own dear husband,

And her white arms would not let go his neck. they would have wept until the rosy dawn began to touch the sky, but shining-eyed athena intervened. she held night back, restraining golden dawn beside the ocean, and would not let her yoke her swift young colts, shining and bright. odysseus, mind whirling, said,  wife, we have not come yet to the end of all our troubles; there are more to come, many hard labors which i must complete.

The spirit of tiresias informed me, that day i went inside the house of hades to ask about the journey home for me and for my men. but come now, let us go to bed together, wife; let us enjoy the pleasure of sweet sleep.  penelope, who always thought ahead, said,  when you wish. the bed is yours. the gods have brought you home, back to your well-built house. but since a god has made you speak about these future labors,

Tell me what they involve. i will find out eventually, and better to know now.  he answered warily,  you really are extraordinary. why would you make me tell you something to cause you pain? it hurts me too, but i will tell the truth, not hide it from you. tiresias foretold that i must travel through many cities carrying an oar, till i reach men who do not know the sea, and do not eat their food with salt, or use

Boats painted red around the prow, or oars, which are the wings of ships. he said that i will know i have arrived when i encounter someone who calls the object on my back a winnowing fan. then i must fix my oar firm in the earth, and make a sacrifice to lord poseidon, of a ram and ox and stud-boar, perfect animals, then come back home and give a hecatomb to all the deathless gods who live above the sky.

If i do this, i will not die at sea; i will grow old in comfort and will meet a gentle death, surrounded by my people, who will be rich and happy.  sensibly penelope said,  if the gods allow you to reach old age in comfort, there is hope that there will be an end to all our troubles.  they talked like this. meanwhile, the slaves were working: eurynome and eurycleia laid soft blankets on the sturdy bed by torchlight.

The nurse went off to sleep, and eurynome picked up the torch and led them to their bed, then went to her room. finally, at last, with joy the husband and the wife arrived back in the rites of their old marriage bed. meanwhile, the herdsmen and telemachus stopped dancing, made the women stop, and went to bed inside the darkened house. and when the couple had enjoyed their lovemaking, they shared another pleasure telling stories.

She told him how she suffered as she watched the crowd of suitors ruining the house, killing so many herds of sheep and cattle and drinking so much wine, because of her. odysseus told her how much he hurt so many other people, and in turn how much he had endured himself. she loved to listen, and she did not fall asleep until he told it all. first, how he slaughtered the cicones, then traveled to the fields

Of lotus-eaters; what the cyclops did, and how he paid him back for ruthlessly eating his men. then how he reached aeolus, who welcomed him and helped him; but it was not yet his fate to come back home; a storm snatched him and bore him off across the sea, howling frustration. then, he said, he came to laestrygonia, whose people wrecked his fleet and killed his men. and he described the cleverness of circe, and his journey

To hades to consult tiresias, and how he saw all his dead friends, and saw his mother, who had loved him as a baby; then how he heard the sirens  endless voices, and reached the wandering rocks and terrible charybdis, and how he had been the first to get away from scylla. and he told her of how his crew devoured the sun god s cattle; zeus roared with smoke and thunder, lightning struck the ship, and all his loyal men were killed.

But he survived, and drifted to ogygia. he told her how calypso trapped him there, inside her hollow cave, and wanted him to be her husband; she took care of him and promised she could set him free from death and time forever. but she never swayed his heart. he suffered terribly, for years, and then he reached phaeacia, where the people looked up to him as if he were a god, and sent him in a ship back home again

To his dear ithaca, with gifts of bronze and gold and piles of clothes. his story ended; sweet sleep released his heart from all his cares. athena, bright-eyed goddess, stayed alert, and when she thought odysseus had finished with taking pleasure in his wife and sleep, she roused the newborn dawn from ocean s streams to bring the golden light to those on earth. odysseus got up and told his wife,  wife, we have both endured our share of trouble:

You wept here as you longed for my return, while zeus and other gods were keeping me away from home, although i longed to come. but now we have returned to our own bed, as we both longed to do. you must look after my property inside the house. meanwhile, i have to go on raids, to steal replacements for all the sheep those swaggering suitors killed, and get the other greeks to give me more, until i fill my folds. but first i will

Go to the orchard in the countryside to see my grieving father. then at dawn the news will spread that i have killed the suitors. your orders, wife though you are smart enough to need no orders are, go with your slaves upstairs, sit quietly, and do not talk to anyone.  he armed himself and called the herdsmen and telemachus, and told them to put on armor too breastplates of bronze. odysseus led all of them outside.

The light was bright across the earth. athena hid them with night and brought them out of town.",the olive tree bed chuckling with glee  the old slave climbed upstairs to tell the queen that her beloved husband was home  her weak old knees felt stronger now  with buoyant steps she went and stood beside her mistress  at her head  and said   dear child  wake up and see  at long last you have got your wish come true  odysseus has come  he is right here inside this house  at last  he slaughtered all the suitors who were wasting his property and threatening his son    but cautiously penelope replied   you poor old thing  the gods have made you crazy  they have the power to turn the sanest person mad  or make fools turn wise  you used to be so sensible  but they have damaged you  why else would you be mocking me like this  with silly stories  in my time of grief  why did you wake me from the sleep that sweetly wrapped round my eyes  i have not slept so soundly since my odysseus marched off to see  that cursed town evilium  go back  if any other slave comes here to wake me and tell me all this nonsense  i will send her back down at once  and i will not be gentle  your old age will protect you from worse scolding   but eurycleia answered with affection   dear child  i am not mocking you  i am telling the truth  odysseus is here  he is the stranger that they all abused  telemachus has known for quite some time   but sensibly he kept his father s plans a secret  so odysseus could take revenge for all their violence and pride   penelope was overjoyed  she jumped from bed and hugged the nurse  and started crying  her words flew fast   dear nanny  if this is the truth  if he has come back to this house  how could he have attacked those shameless suitors  when he is just one man  and there were always so many crowded in there   eurycleia  answered   i did not see or learn the details  i heard the sound of screaming from the men as they were killed  we huddled in our room and kept the doors tight shut  until your son called me his father sent him  then i saw odysseus surrounded by dead bodies  they lay on top of one another  sprawled across the solid floor  you would have been thrilled if you saw him  like a lion  drenched in blood and gore  now they are all piled up  out by the courtyard gates  and he is burning a mighty fire to fumigate the palace  restoring all its loveliness  he sent me to fetch you  come with me  so both of you can start to live in happiness  you have endured such misery  your wish came true  he is alive  he has come home again  and found you and your son  and he has taken revenge on all the suitors who abused him   penelope said carefully   do not  start gloating  as you know  my son and i would be delighted if he came  we all would  however  what you say cannot be true  some god has killed the suitors out of anger at their abuse of power and their pride  they failed to show respect to visitors  both good and bad  their foolishness has killed them  but my odysseus has lost his home  and far away from greece  he lost his life   the nurse replied   dear child  how can you say  your husband will not come  when he is here  beside the hearth  your heart has always been mistrustful  but i have clear evidence  when i was washing him  i felt the scar made when the boar impaled him with its tusk  i tried to tell you  but he grabbed my throat and stopped me spoiling all his plans  come with me  i swear on my own life  if i am lying  then kill me   wise penelope said   nanny  it must be hard for you to understand  the ways of gods  despite your cleverness  but let us go to meet my son  so i can see the suitors dead  and see the man who killed them   so she went downstairs  her heart could not decide if she should keep her distance as she was questioning her own dear husband  or go right up to him and kiss his face and hold his hands in hers  she crossed the threshold and sat across from him beside the wall  in firelight  he sat beside the pillar   and kept his eyes down  waiting to find out whether the woman who once shared his bed would speak to him  she sat in silence  stunned  sometimes when she was glancing at his face it seemed like him  but then his dirty clothes were unfamiliar  telemachus scolded her   mother  cruel  heartless mother  why are you doing this  rejecting father  why do you not go over  sit beside him  and talk to him  no woman in the world  would be so obstinate  to keep your distance from him when he has come back after twenty long years of suffering  your heart is always harder than rock   but thoughtfully she answered   my child  i am confused  i cannot speak  or meet his eyes  if this is really him  if my odysseus has come back home  we have our ways to recognize each other  through secret signs known only to us two   hardened odysseus began to smile   he told the boy   you must allow your mother to test me out  she will soon know me better  while i am dirty  dressed in rags  she will not treat me with kindness or acknowledge me  meanwhile  we must make plans  if someone murders even just one man  even one who had few friends in his community  the killer is forced to run away and leave his homeland and family  but we have killed the mainstay of ithaca  the island s best young men   so what do you suggest   telemachus said warily   you have to work it out  they say you have the finest mind in all the world  no mortal man can rival you in cleverness  lead me  and i will be behind you right away  and i will do my best to be as brave as i can be   odysseus was quick to form a plan  he told him   here is what i think is best  the three of you should wash and change your clothes   and make the slave girls go put on clean dresses  then let the godlike singer take the lyre and play a clear and cheerful dancing tune  so passersby or neighbors hearing it will think it is a wedding  we must not allow the news about the suitors  murder to spread too far until we reach the woods of our estate  and there we can decide the best path forward offered us by zeus   they did as lord odysseus had said   they washed and changed their tunics  and the slave girls prepared themselves  the singer took the lyre  and roused in them desire to hear sweet music  and dance  the house resounded with the thump of beating feet from all the dancing men and girls in pretty sashes  those outside who heard the noises said to one another   so somebody is marrying the queen who had so many suitors  headstrong woman  she must have lacked the strength to wait it out  and keep her husband s house safe till he came   they spoke with no idea what really happened  eurynome the slave woman began to wash strong willed odysseus  she rubbed him with olive oil  and dressed him in a tunic and handsome cloak  and then athena poured attractiveness from head to toe  and made him taller and stronger  and his hair grew thick and curly as a hyacinth  as when a craftsman whom athena or hephaestus  has trained in metalwork  so he can make beautiful artifacts  pours gold on silver  so she poured beauty on his head and shoulders  after his bath he looked like an immortal  he sat down in the same chair opposite his wife and said   extraordinary woman  the gods have given you the hardest heart  no other wife would so reject a husband who had been suffering for twenty years and finally come home  well  nanny  make  a bed for me  so i can rest  this woman must have an iron heart   penelope said shrewdly   you extraordinary man  i am not acting proud  or underplaying this big event  yet i am not surprised at how you look  you looked like this the day your long oars sailed away from ithaca  now  eurycleia  make the bed for him outside the room he built himself  pull out the bedstead  and spread quilts and blankets on it    she spoke to test him  and odysseus was furious  and told his loyal wife   woman  your words have cut my heart  who moved my bed  it would be difficult for even a master craftsman though a god could do it with ease  no man  however young and strong  could pry it out  there is a trick to how this bed was made  i made it  no one else  inside the court there grew an olive tree with delicate long leaves  full grown and green   as sturdy as a pillar  and i built the room around it  i packed stones together  and fixed a roof and fitted doors  at last i trimmed the olive tree and used my bronze to cut the branches off from root to tip and planed it down and skillfully transformed the trunk into a bedpost  with a drill  i bored right through it  this was my first bedpost  and then i made the other three  inlaid with gold and silver and with ivory   i stretched ox leather straps across  dyed purple  now i have told the secret trick  the token  but woman  wife  i do not know if someone  a man has cut the olive trunk and moved my bed  or if it is still safe   at that  her heart and body suddenly relaxed  she recognized the tokens he had shown her  she burst out crying and ran straight towards him and threw her arms around him  kissed his face  and said   do not be angry at me now   odysseus  in every other way you are a very understanding man  the gods have made us suffer  they refused to let us stay together and enjoy our youth until we reached the edge of age together  please forgive me  do not keep bearing a grudge because when i first saw you  i would not welcome you immediately  i felt a constant dread that some bad man would fool me with his lies  there are so many  dishonest  clever men  that foreigner would never have got helen into bed  if she had known the greeks would march to war and bring her home again  it was a goddess who made her do it  putting in her heart the passion that first caused my grief as well  now you have told the story of our bed  the secret that no other mortal knows  except yourself and me  and just one slave  actoris  whom my father gave to me  when i came here  who used to guard our room  you made my stubborn heart believe in you   this made him want to cry  he held his love  his faithful wife  and wept  as welcome as the land to swimmers  when poseidon wrecks their ship at sea and breaks it with great waves and driving winds  a few escape the sea and reach the shore  their skin all caked with brine  grateful to be alive  they crawl to land  so glad she was to see her own dear husband   and her white arms would not let go his neck  they would have wept until the rosy dawn began to touch the sky  but shining eyed athena intervened  she held night back  restraining golden dawn beside the ocean  and would not let her yoke her swift young colts  shining and bright  odysseus  mind whirling  said   wife  we have not come yet to the end of all our troubles  there are more to come  many hard labors which i must complete   the spirit of tiresias informed me  that day i went inside the house of hades to ask about the journey home for me and for my men  but come now  let us go to bed together  wife  let us enjoy the pleasure of sweet sleep   penelope  who always thought ahead  said   when you wish  the bed is yours  the gods have brought you home  back to your well built house  but since a god has made you speak about these future labors   tell me what they involve  i will find out eventually  and better to know now   he answered warily   you really are extraordinary  why would you make me tell you something to because you pain  it hurts me too  but i will tell the truth  not hide it from you  tiresias foretold that i must travel through many cities carrying an oar  till i reach men who do not know the sea  and do not eat their food with salt  or use  boats painted red around the prow  or oars  which are the wings of ships  he said that i will know i have arrived when i encounter someone who calls the object on my back a winnowing fan  then i must fix my oar firm in the earth  and make a sacrifice to lord poseidon  of a ram and ox and stud boar  perfect animals  then come back home and give a hecatomb to all the deathless gods who live above the sky   if i do this  i will not die at sea  i will grow old in comfort and will meet a gentle death  surrounded by my people  who will be rich and happy   sensibly penelope said   if the gods allow you to reach old age in comfort  there is hope that there will be an end to all our troubles   they talked like this  meanwhile  the slaves were working  eurynome and eurycleia laid soft blankets on the sturdy bed by torchlight   the nurse went off to sleep  and eurynome picked up the torch and led them to their bed  then went to her room  finally  at last  with joy the husband and the wife arrived back in the rites of their old marriage bed  meanwhile  the herdsmen and telemachus stopped dancing  made the women stop  and went to bed inside the darkened house  and when the couple had enjoyed their lovemaking  they shared another pleasure telling stories   she told him how she suffered as she watched the crowd of suitors ruining the house  killing so many herds of sheep and cattle and drinking so much wine  because of her  odysseus told her how much he hurt so many other people  and in turn how much he had endured himself  she loved to listen  and she did not fall asleep until he told it all  first  how he slaughtered the cicones  then traveled to the fields  of lotus eaters  what the cyclops did  and how he paid him back for ruthlessly eating his men  then how he reached aeolus  who welcomed him and helped him  but it was not yet his fate to come back home  a storm snatched him and bore him off across the sea  howling frustration  then  he said  he came to laestrygonia  whose people wrecked his fleet and killed his men  and he described the cleverness of circe  and his journey  to hades to consult tiresias  and how he saw all his dead friends  and saw his mother  who had loved him as a baby  then how he heard the sirens  endless voices  and reached the wandering rocks and terrible charybdis  and how he had been the first to get away from scylla  and he told her of how his crew devoured the sun god s cattle  zeus

Restless spirits then hermes called the spirits of the suitors out of the house. he held the golden wand with which he casts a spell to close men s eyes or open those of sleepers when he wants. he led the spirits and they followed, squeaking like bats in secret crannies of a cave, who cling together, and when one becomes detached and falls down from the rock, the rest flutter and squeak just so the spirits squeaked, and hurried after hermes, lord of healing.

On open roads they crossed the ocean stream, went past the rock of leucas and the gates of helius the sun, and skittered through the provinces of dreams, and soon arrived in fields of asphodel, the home of shadows who have been worn to weariness by life. they found achilles  ghost there, and patroclus, and ajax, the most handsome of the greeks after unmatched achilles. agamemnon had just arrived to join them, in deep grief

For his own death, and with him came the others killed by aegisthus and his bodyguards. achilles  ghost spoke first.  o agamemnon! men used to say that out of all the heroes, zeus, lord of lightning, favored you the most, because you had command of a great army in troy where greeks endured the pain of war. but death, which no man living can avoid, was destined to arrive at the wrong time. if only you had died at troy and won

The glory of your rank as a commander! all of the greeks and allies would have built a tomb for you, and afterwards your son would have received great honor. as it is, it was your fate to die a dreadful death.  the ghost of agamemnon answered him,  achilles, son of peleus, you were lucky to die at troy, away from argos. the finest warriors of greece and troy fought round your corpse and died. you lay a hero,

Magnificent amid the whirling dust, your days of driving chariots forgotten. we fought all day, and would have fought forever, but zeus sent winds to stop us. then we brought you back to our ships, and laid you on a bier, away from battle, and we bathed your skin in heated water and anointed you with oil. we wept for you and cut our hair. your mother heard the news, and with her nymphs she came up from the waves. an eerie wailing

Sounded across the sea. the men began to tremble, and they would have rushed on board, if wise old nestor had not made them stop. he always had the best advice for us, and said,  my lords, stay here. it is his mother, coming with her immortal water nymphs to find her own dead son.  at this, the greeks regained their courage. the old sea king s daughters gathered around you weeping, and they dressed you in clothes of the immortals. all nine muses

Sang lamentations in their lovely voices. no one could keep from crying at the sound, so moving was their song. the gods and men were mourning seventeen long nights and days and then we gave you to the pyre, and killed many fat sheep and cattle for your corpse. you burned in clothes from gods; you were anointed with oil and honey. troops of warriors on foot and horseback, fully armed, went marching around your pyre, and made a mighty din.

At last hephaestus  flame consumed your flesh. when morning came, we gathered your white bones, achilles, and anointed them with oil and unmixed wine. your mother gave an urn of gold with double handles, which she said hephaestus made and dionysus gave her. your white bones lay inside it, lord achilles, mixed with the bones of your dead friend patroclus. we laid the urn beside antilochus, the friend you most respected after him.

The army of greek warriors assembled, and with all reverence we heaped a mound out on the headland by the hellespont, large enough to be visible to those at sea, both now and in the years to come. your mother asked the gods for splendid prizes and put them in the midst of an arena, so the best athletes could compete for them. you have seen many burials of heroes, when young men tie their tunics to compete.

But you would have been startled at the riches that silver-footed thetis brought for you. you were so dearly loved by all the gods. you did not lose your name in death. your fame will live forever; everyone will know achilles. as for me, what good was it that i wound up the war? when i came home aegisthus and my wicked, fiendish wife murdered me. zeus had planned it.  while they talked, hermes the guide came near them, with the suitors

Killed by odysseus. the two great lords, astonished at the sight, rushed up to them, and agamemnon s spirit recognized the son of his old friend, menelaus, with whom he stayed in ithaca. he said,  amphimedon! what happened to you all? why have you all come down here to the land of darkness? you are all so young and strong; you must have been the best boys in your town. maybe poseidon raised great waves and winds

To wreck your fleet? or were you all attacked by men on land while you were poaching cows or flocks of sheep, or fighting for a city and women? you must tell me! we are friends. do you remember when i visited your home, when menelaus and myself were trying to persuade odysseus to join the fleet and sail with us to troy? it took a whole damned month to cross the sea; we had to work so hard to sway that man,

Who sacked the city.  amphimedon s spirit answered,  great general, agamemnon, yes, i do remember everything you say. and i will tell, in every gruesome detail, the manner of our death. odysseus was gone for many years. we came to court his wife, who had no wish to marry us, but would not tell us no or make an end. she planned black death for us, and tricked us, too. she set a mighty loom up in the hall,

And wove a wide fine cloth, and said to us,  young suitors, now odysseus is dead. i know that you are eager for the wedding, but wait till i am finished with this cloth, so that my weaving will not go to waste. it is a shroud for when laertes dies, so that the women in the town do not blame me because a man who gained such wealth was buried with no winding-sheet.  her words convinced us. so by day she wove the cloth,

And then at night by torchlight, she unwove it. for three long years she fooled us; when the hours and months had passed, the fourth year rolled around, and then a girl who knew the truth told us; and we found her unraveling her work. we made her finish it. when she had washed the marvelous huge sheet, she showed it to us, bright as the sun or moon. and then some spirit of ruin brought odysseus from somewhere to ithaca; he went out to the fields,

To where the swineherd lived. his own dear son sailed in his black ship back from sandy pylos. the two of them made plans to murder us. they showed up at the palace first the boy, and then odysseus propped on a stick and dressed in dirty rags. he seemed to be a poor old homeless man, who suddenly appeared, led by the swineherd. none of us could recognize him, even those of us who were a little older than myself.

We hurled insulting words and missiles at him, and for a while he patiently endured abuse in his own home. but when the will of zeus awakened him, with his son s help, he put the splendid weapons in the storeroom and locked the door. then came his cunning plan: he told his wife to set for us the axes and bow. the competition meant our doom, the start of slaughter. none of us could string the mighty bow we all were far too weak.

But when it was his turn, we shouted out that nobody should give the bow to him, no matter what he said. telemachus alone insisted that he ought to have it. at last odysseus, with calm composure, took it and strung it easily, and shot all through the iron axes. then he stood astride the threshold with a fearsome scowl, and started shooting fast. his arrow struck antinous, our leader. with sure aim

He shot his deadly arrows at more men; those nearest to him fell. it was apparent some god was helping them. impelled by rage, they rushed around the palace killing us in turn. there was a dreadful noise of screaming and broken skulls; the whole floor ran with blood. so, agamemnon, we were killed. our bodies still lie unburied in our killer s house. our families at home do not yet know. they need to wash the black blood from our wounds

And weep for us and lay our bodies out. this is the honor due the dead.  the ghost of agamemnon answered,  lucky you, cunning odysseus: you got yourself a wife of virtue great penelope. how principled she was, that she remembered her husband all those years! her fame will live forever, and the deathless gods will make a poem to delight all those on earth about intelligent penelope.

Not like my wife who murdered her own husband! her story will be hateful; she will bring bad reputation to all other women, even the good ones.  so they spoke together, standing in hades, hidden in the earth. meanwhile, odysseus and his companions had left the town and quickly reached the farm, won by laertes long ago he fought hard for it, and his house was there; the slaves, who had to do his wishes, lived and slept

And ate their food in quarters that surrounded the central house. one was from sicily, the old slave woman who took care of him out in the countryside. odysseus spoke to his slaves and to his son.  go in, choose the best pig and kill it for our dinner. and i will test my father, to find out if he will know me instantly on sight, or not i have been absent for so long.  at that he gave his weapons to the slaves.

They quickly went inside. odysseus walked to the fruitful orchard on his quest. he did not find old dolius, the steward, nor any of his slaves or sons he had led them to gather rocks to build dry-walls. odysseus  father was alone, inside the well-built orchard, digging earth to make it level round a tree. he wore a dirty ragged tunic, and his leggings had leather patches to protect from scratches.

He wore thick gloves because of thorns, and had a cap of goatskin. he was wallowing in grief. the veteran, odysseus, seeing his father worn by age and burdened by desperate, heartfelt sorrow, stopped beneath a towering pear tree, weeping. then he wondered whether to kiss his father, twine around him, and tell him that he had come home again, and everything that happened on the way  or question him. he thought it best to start

By testing him with teasing and abuse. with this in mind, odysseus approached him, as he was digging round the plant, head down. his famous son stood at his side and said,  old man, you know your trade and take good care of this neat garden. every plant and vine, and tree the figs, the pears, the olive trees  and bed of herbs is nicely tended. but i have to say something please do not get angry at me you do not take good care

Of your own self. you are unkempt, old man. your skin is rough and dirty and your clothes are rags. your master is neglecting you, although you are not lazy. in your height and face, you seem a leader, not a slave. you look like someone who would bathe and eat and sleep on fluffy pillows and fine sheets, as is appropriate for older people. but tell me this: whose slave are you? whose garden do you take care of? also, have i come

To ithaca, as somebody i met was telling me just now? but he was not a helpful man: when i was asking him about a friend of mine, an old guest-friend, whether he is alive or dead in hades, this fellow would not say, or even listen. a while ago, in my own native land, i had a guest to stay with me, who was my dearest friend of all my visitors. he said he was from ithaca, and that

Laertes was his father. i had brought him into my house, and welcomed him with warmth; i can afford to be quite generous. i gave him seven heaps of golden treasure, a bowl made all of silver and inlaid with flowers, twelve unfolded cloaks, and twelve thick blankets, twelve fine mantles, and twelve tunics. also i gave him four well-trained slave women, beautiful ones, whom he picked out himself.  his father answered through his tears,  yes, stranger,

You have reached ithaca. but cruel men have taken over here. you will receive nothing for all those gifts. if you had found him still living in this land, he would have matched your gifts and welcomed you with open arms before he sent you home. initial kindness deserves due recompense. but tell me now, how long is it since that unlucky man visited you? your guest was my own son! perhaps fish ate him out at sea, so far

From home and family; or birds and beasts ate him on land. his mother did not lay his body out and weep for him; nor i, his father; nor penelope his wife, a wise and wealthy woman. she has not closed her own husband s eyes or given him a funeral. the dead deserve this honor. but tell me now, who are you? from what city? who are your parents? do you have a ship docked somewhere, which conveyed you here with friends

And crew? or did you sail as passenger on someone else s ship, which now is gone?  lying odysseus replied,  i will tell you the truth completely. i am from alybas, and i have a palace there. my name is eperitus; i am son of king apheidas, son of polypemon. an evil spirit struck me and i came from sicily against my will. my ship is docked away from town. it is five years

Since poor, unfortunate odysseus came to my home. as he was setting out we saw good omens birds towards the right  so we were hopeful we would meet again as friends, and share more gifts.  at this, a cloud of black grief wrapped itself around laertes. he poured two handfuls of the ashy dust over his gray old head, and started sobbing. odysseus felt heart-wrenched to see his own beloved father in this state; sharp pain

Pierced through his nostrils. he rushed up to him and threw his arms around him, kissing him, and saying,  father! it is me! i have been gone for twenty years, and now am home, in my own father s country. stop your tears. i will explain, though we do not have long. i killed the suitors in my house; i took revenge for all the pain they caused.  laertes answered,  if you are really my own son odysseus come home, show me a sign;

Let me be sure of it.  odysseus was quick to answer.  first, look here: the scar made by the boar s white tusk when i had gone to mount parnassus. you and mother sent me, to see my grandfather, autolycus, and get the gifts that he had promised me. next i will tell you all the trees that grow in this fine orchard, which you gave to me. when i was little, i would follow you around the garden, asking all their names.

We walked beneath these trees; you named them all and promised them to me. ten apple trees, and thirteen pear trees, forty figs, and fifty grapevines which ripen one by one their clusters change as the weather presses from the sky, sent down by zeus.  at that, laertes  heart and legs gave way; he recognized the signs odysseus had given as clear proof. he threw both arms around his ruthless son, who caught him as he fainted. when his breath

And mind returned, he said,  o father zeus, you gods are truly rulers of olympus, if it is true the suitors have been punished for all the monstrous things they did. but i am terrified the ithacans may soon attack us here, and spread the news around to all the towns of cephallenia.  scheming odysseus said,  do not fear. come to the farmhouse, where i sent my boy to go with the two herdsmen, to prepare

Dinner as fast as possible.  with this, the son and father walked towards the house. they found them serving generous plates of meat and mixing wine. the slave from sicily washed brave laertes, and she rubbed his skin with olive oil, and wrapped a handsome cloak around him. then athena, standing near, made him grow taller and more muscular. when he emerged, odysseus was shocked to see him looking like a god. his words

Flew fast.  oh, father! you look different! a god has made you taller and more handsome.  thoughtful laertes said,  o father zeus, athena, and apollo! if i were as strong as when i took the sturdy fortress of nericus, out on the mainland shore, when i was king of cephallenia, i would have stood beside you yesterday, with weapons on my back, and fought with you against the suitors who were in our house!

I would have brought so many of them down, you would have been delighted!  so they spoke. the work of cooking dinner was complete, and they sat down on chairs and stools, and reached to take the food. the old slave dolius approached them with his sons, who had been working. their mother, the sicilian old woman, had gone to call them. she took care of them, and also the old man, made weak by age. they saw odysseus and stared, then stopped,

Astonished. but he spoke to reassure them.  old man, sit down and eat. the rest of you, put your surprise entirely out of mind. we have been waiting ages; we are eager to have our dinner here.  but dolius ran straight to him with arms outstretched, and took odysseus  wrist and kissed his hand, and let his words fly out.  my friend! you have come home! we are so very glad to see you! we never thought this day would come! the gods

Have brought you here! a heartfelt welcome to you! i pray the gods will bless you! does your wife know you have come back home? or should i send a message?  but odysseus said coolly,  old man, she knows already. do not bother.  so dolius sat back down on his chair. his sons were also clustering around their famous owner, lord odysseus, to welcome him and hold him in their arms. then they sat down in turn beside their father.

They had their meal together in the farmhouse. meanwhile, swift rumor spread the news all through the city, of the suitors  dreadful murder. when people heard, they rushed from all directions towards the palace of odysseus, with shouts and lamentations. then they brought the bodies from the house and buried them. the ones from distant towns were sent back home by ship. the mourners gathered in the square, heartbroken. when the people were assembled,

Eupeithes first stood up and spoke to them. this man was inconsolable with grief for his dead son antinous, the boy odysseus killed first. his father wept, tears falling as he spoke.  this scheming man, my friends, has done us all most monstrous wrongs. first, he took many good men off to sail with him, and lost the ships, and killed the men! now he has come and murdered all the best of cephallenia. come on, before

He sneaks away to pylos or to elis, we have to act! we will be shamed forever unless we take revenge on him for killing our sons and brothers. i would have no wish to live; i would prefer to die and join the boys already dead. we have to stop them escaping overseas! come on, right now!  he spoke in tears, and pity seized them all. but medon and the bard had woken up; they came outside and stood among the crowd.

They all were terrified, and medon said,  now listen, ithacans. odysseus could not have done such things without the help of gods. i saw a god myself, disguised as mentor, sometimes standing at his side, giving him will to fight, and sometimes rushing all through the hall to make the suitors scatter. they fell like flies.  pale terror seized them all. then halitherses, an old warrior, the only one to know both past and future,

Stood up; he wished them well. he said to them,  now hear me, ithacans. my friends, it was because of your own cowardice this happened. you did not listen to me, or to mentor, when we were telling you to stop your sons from acting stupidly. they did great wrong, through their impulsiveness; they skimmed the wealth of an important man, and disrespected his wife, believing he would never come. but listen now. we must not go and fight,

Or we will bring more ruin on our heads.  at that, some stayed there, huddling together, but more than half jumped up with shouts. they thought eupeithes had the right idea. they rushed to arms, and strapped their gleaming armor on, and gathered in a mass before the town. eupeithes was their leader to his cost. he thought he would avenge his murdered son. in fact, he would not come back home; it was his fate to die out there. and then athena

Spoke to the son of cronus.  father zeus, highest of powers! tell what hidden thoughts lie in you. will you now make yet more war and bitter strife, or join the sides in friendship?  the gatherer of clouds replied,  my child, why ask me this? the plan was your idea, to have odysseus come take revenge. do as you wish. but here is my advice. he has already punished all the suitors, so let them swear an oath that he will be

The king forever, and let us make sure the murder of their brothers and their sons will be forgotten. let them all be friends, just as before, and let them live in peace and in prosperity.  athena was already eager; at these words she swooped down from olympus. meanwhile, they had finished dinner, and battle-scarred odysseus said,  somebody must go and see if they are coming near.  a son of dolius

Obeyed and went. as he stepped out, he stood across the threshold, and he saw them all near to the house. at once his words took wings. he told odysseus,  those men are near! we have to arm, and fast!  they quickly armed. odysseus, his son and their two slaves made four, and dolius had his six sons. laertes and old dolius were also needed as fighters, though they had gray hair. when all of them were dressed in gleaming bronze,

They opened up the gates and went outside; odysseus was leading them. athena came near, disguised as mentor. when he saw her, weathered odysseus was glad and turned towards telemachus and said,  now, son, soon you will have experience of fighting in battle, the true test of worth. you must not shame your father s family; for years we have been known across the world for courage and manliness.  telemachus inhaled,

Then said,  just watch me, father, if you want to see my spirit. i will bring no shame onto your family. you should not speak of shame.  laertes, thrilled, cried out,  ah, gods! a happy day for me! my son and grandson are arguing about how tough they are!  with glinting eyes, athena stood beside him and said,  you are my favorite, laertes. pray to the bright-eyed goddess and her father, then lift and hurl your spear.  as she said this,

Athena breathed great energy inside him. laertes quickly raised and hurled the spear, and struck eupeithes through his bronze-cheeked helmet, which did not stop the weapon; it pierced through. then with a thud he fell; his armor clanged around him on the ground. odysseus charged the front line, his radiant son beside him; they hacked with swords and curving spears. they would have killed them all and made sure none of them could go back home but then athena spoke.

Her voice held back the fighters.  ithacans! stop this destructive war; shed no more blood, and go your separate ways, at once!  her voice struck them with pale green fear and made them drop their weapons. they were desperate to save their lives, and they turned back towards the city. unwavering odysseus let out a dreadful roar, then crouched and swooped upon them, just like an eagle flying from above. but zeus sent down a thunderbolt, which fell

In front of his own daughter, great athena. she looked at him with steely eyes and said,  odysseus, you are adaptable; you always find solutions. stop this war, or zeus will be enraged at you.  he was glad to obey her. then athena made the warring sides swear solemn oaths of peace for future times still in her guise as mentor.
",restless spirits then hermes called the spirits of the suitors out of the house  he held the golden wand with which he casts a spell to close men s eyes or open those of sleepers when he wants  he led the spirits and they followed  squeaking like bats in secret crannies of a cave  who cling together  and when one becomes detached and falls down from the rock  the rest flutter and squeak just so the spirits squeaked  and hurried after hermes  lord of healing   on open roads they crossed the ocean stream  went past the rock of leucas and the gates of helius the sun  and skittered through the provinces of dreams  and soon arrived in fields of asphodel  the home of shadows who have been worn to weariness by life  they found achilles  ghost there  and patroclus  and ajax  the most handsome of the greeks after unmatched achilles  agamemnon had just arrived to join them  in deep grief  for his own death  and with him came the others killed by aegisthus and his bodyguards  achilles  ghost spoke first   o agamemnon  men used to say that out of all the heroes  zeus  lord of lightning  favored you the most  because you had command of a great army in troy where greeks endured the pain of war  but death  which no man living can avoid  was destined to arrive at the wrong time  if only you had died at troy and won  the glory of your rank as a commander  all of the greeks and allies would have built a tomb for you  and afterwards your son would have received great honor  as it is  it was your fate to die a dreadful death   the ghost of agamemnon answered him   achilles  son of peleus  you were lucky to die at troy  away from argos  the finest warriors of greece and troy fought round your corpse and died  you lay a hero   magnificent amid the whirling dust  your days of driving chariots forgotten  we fought all day  and would have fought forever  but zeus sent winds to stop us  then we brought you back to our ships  and laid you on a bier  away from battle  and we bathed your skin in heated water and anointed you with oil  we wept for you and cut our hair  your mother heard the news  and with her nymphs she came up from the waves  an eerie wailing  sounded across the sea  the men began to tremble  and they would have rushed on board  if wise old nestor had not made them stop  he always had the best advice for us  and said   my lords  stay here  it is his mother  coming with her immortal water nymphs to find her own dead son   at this  the greeks regained their courage  the old sea king s daughters gathered around you weeping  and they dressed you in clothes of the immortals  all nine muses  sang lamentations in their lovely voices  no one could keep from crying at the sound  so moving was their song  the gods and men were mourning seventeen long nights and days and then we gave you to the pyre  and killed many fat sheep and cattle for your corpse  you burned in clothes from gods  you were anointed with oil and honey  troops of warriors on foot and horseback  fully armed  went marching around your pyre  and made a mighty din   at last hephaestus  flame consumed your flesh  when morning came  we gathered your white bones  achilles  and anointed them with oil and unmixed wine  your mother gave an urn of gold with double handles  which she said hephaestus made and dionysus gave her  your white bones lay inside it  lord achilles  mixed with the bones of your dead friend patroclus  we laid the urn beside antilochus  the friend you most respected after him   the army of greek warriors assembled  and with all reverence we heaped a mound out on the headland by the hellespont  large enough to be visible to those at sea  both now and in the years to come  your mother asked the gods for splendid prizes and put them in the midst of an arena  so the best athletes could compete for them  you have seen many burials of heroes  when young men tie their tunics to compete   but you would have been startled at the riches that silver footed thetis brought for you  you were so dearly loved by all the gods  you did not lose your name in death  your fame will live forever  everyone will know achilles  as for me  what good was it that i wound up the war  when i came home aegisthus and my wicked  fiendish wife murdered me  zeus had planned it   while they talked  hermes the guide came near them  with the suitors  killed by odysseus  the two great lords  astonished at the sight  rushed up to them  and agamemnon s spirit recognized the son of his old friend  menelaus  with whom he stayed in ithaca  he said   amphimedon  what happened to you all  why have you all come down here to the land of darkness  you are all so young and strong  you must have been the best boys in your town  maybe poseidon raised great waves and winds  to wreck your fleet  or were you all attacked by men on land while you were poaching cows or flocks of sheep  or fighting for a city and women  you must tell me  we are friends  do you remember when i visited your home  when menelaus and myself were trying to persuade odysseus to join the fleet and sail with us to troy  it took a whole damned month to cross the sea  we had to work so hard to sway that man   who sacked the city   amphimedon s spirit answered   great general  agamemnon  yes  i do remember everything you say  and i will tell  in every gruesome detail  the manner of our death  odysseus was gone for many years  we came to court his wife  who had no wish to marry us  but would not tell us no or make an end  she planned black death for us  and tricked us  too  she set a mighty loom up in the hall   and wove a wide fine cloth  and said to us   young suitors  now odysseus is dead  i know that you are eager for the wedding  but wait till i am finished with this cloth  so that my weaving will not go to waste  it is a shroud for when laertes dies  so that the women in the town do not blame me because a man who gained such wealth was buried with no winding sheet   her words convinced us  so by day she wove the cloth   and then at night by torchlight  she unwove it  for three long years she fooled us  when the hours and months had passed  the fourth year rolled around  and then a girl who knew the truth told us  and we found her unraveling her work  we made her finish it  when she had washed the marvelous huge sheet  she showed it to us  bright as the sun or moon  and then some spirit of ruin brought odysseus from somewhere to ithaca  he went out to the fields   to where the swineherd lived  his own dear son sailed in his black ship back from sandy pylos  the two of them made plans to murder us  they showed up at the palace first the boy  and then odysseus propped on a stick and dressed in dirty rags  he seemed to be a poor old homeless man  who suddenly appeared  led by the swineherd  none of us could recognize him  even those of us who were a little older than myself   we hurled insulting words and missiles at him  and for a while he patiently endured abuse in his own home  but when the will of zeus awakened him  with his son s help  he put the splendid weapons in the storeroom and locked the door  then came his cunning plan  he told his wife to set for us the axes and bow  the competition meant our doom  the start of slaughter  none of us could string the mighty bow we all were far too weak   but when it was his turn  we shouted out that nobody should give the bow to him  no matter what he said  telemachus alone insisted that he ought to have it  at last odysseus  with calm composure  took it and strung it easily  and shot all through the iron axes  then he stood astride the threshold with a fearsome scowl  and started shooting fast  his arrow struck antinous  our leader  with sure aim  he shot his deadly arrows at more men  those nearest to him fell  it was apparent some god was helping them  impelled by rage  they rushed around the palace killing us in turn  there was a dreadful noise of screaming and broken skulls  the whole floor ran with blood  so  agamemnon  we were killed  our bodies still lie unburied in our killer s house  our families at home do not yet know  they need to wash the black blood from our wounds  and weep for us and lay our bodies out  this is the honor due the dead   the ghost of agamemnon answered   lucky you  cunning odysseus  you got yourself a wife of virtue great penelope  how principled she was  that she remembered her husband all those years  her fame will live forever  and the deathless gods will make a poem to delight all those on earth about intelligent penelope   not like my wife who murdered her own husband  her story will be hateful  she will bring bad reputation to all other women  even the good ones   so they spoke together  standing in hades  hidden in the earth  meanwhile  odysseus and his companions had left the town and quickly reached the farm  won by laertes long ago he fought hard for it  and his house was there  the slaves  who had to do his wishes  lived and slept  and ate their food in quarters that surrounded the central house  one was from sicily  the old slave woman who took care of him out in the countryside  odysseus spoke to his slaves and to his son   go in  choose the best pig and kill it for our dinner  and i will test my father  to find out if he will know me instantly on sight  or not i have been absent for so long   at that he gave his weapons to the slaves   they quickly went inside  odysseus walked to the fruitful orchard on his quest  he did not find old dolius  the steward  nor any of his slaves or sons he had led them to gather rocks to build dry walls  odysseus  father was alone  inside the well built orchard  digging earth to make it level round a tree  he wore a dirty ragged tunic  and his leggings had leather patches to protect from scratches   he wore thick gloves because of thorns  and had a cap of goatskin  he was wallowing in grief  the veteran  odysseus  seeing his father worn by age and burdened by desperate  heartfelt sorrow  stopped beneath a towering pear tree  weeping  then he wondered whether to kiss his father  twine around him  and tell him that he had come home again  and everything that happened on the way  or question him  he thought it best to start  by testing him with teasing and abuse  with this in mind  odysseus approached him  as he was digging round the plant  head down  his famous son stood at

make yet more war and bitter strife  or join the sides in friendship   the gatherer of clouds replied   my child  why ask me this  the plan was your idea  to have odysseus come take revenge  do as you wish  but here is my advice  he has already punished all the suitors  so let them swear an oath that he will be  the king forever  and let us make sure the murder of their brothers and their sons will be forgotten  let them all be friends  just as before  and let them live in peace and in prosperity   athena was already eager  at these words she swooped down from olympus  meanwhile  they had finished dinner  and battle scarred odysseus said   somebody must go and see if they are coming near   a son of dolius  obeyed and went  as he stepped out  he stood across the threshold  and he saw them all near to the house  at once his words took wings  he told odysseus   those men are near  we have to arm  and fast   they quickly armed  odysseus  his son and their two slaves made four  and dolius had his six sons  laertes and old dolius were also needed as fighters  though they had gray hair  when all of them were dressed in gleaming bronze   they opened up the gates and went outside  odysseus was leading them  athena came near  disguised as mentor  when he saw her  weathered odysseus was glad and turned towards telemachus and said   now  son  soon you will have experience of fighting in battle  the true test of worth  you must not shame your father s family  for years we have been known across the world for courage and manliness   telemachus inhaled   then said   just watch me  father  if you want to see my spirit  i will bring no shame onto your family  you should not speak of shame   laertes  thrilled  cried out   ah  gods  a happy day for me  my son and grandson are arguing about how tough they are   with glinting eyes  athena stood beside him and said   you are my favorite  laertes  pray to the bright eyed goddess and her father  then lift and hurl your spear   as she said this   athena breathed great energy inside him  laertes quickly raised and hurled the spear  and struck eupeithes through his bronze cheeked helmet  which did not stop the weapon  it pierced through  then with a thud he fell  his armor clanged around him on the ground  odysseus charged the front line  his radiant son beside him  they hacked with swords and curving spears  they would have killed them all and made sure none of them could go back home but then athena spoke   her voice held back the fighters   ithacans  stop this destructive war  she would no more blood  and go your separate ways  at once   her voice struck them with pale green fear and made them drop their weapons  they were desperate to save their lives  and they turned back towards the city  unwavering odysseus let out a dreadful roar  then crouched and swooped upon them  just like an eagle flying from above  but zeus sent down a thunderbolt  which fell  in front of his own daughter  great athena  she looked at him with steely eyes and said   odysseus  you are adaptable  you always find solutions  stop this war  or zeus will be enraged at you   he was glad to obey her  then athena made the warring sides swear solemn oaths of peace for future times still in her guise as
