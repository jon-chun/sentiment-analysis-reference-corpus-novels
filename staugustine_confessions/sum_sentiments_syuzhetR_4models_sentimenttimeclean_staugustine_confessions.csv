"156","for what they  with whatever motive  would have me learn  i might afterwards have put to good use",1.55,1,3,3
"157","for i disobeyed  not from a better choice  but from love of play  loving the pride of victory in my contests  and to have my ears tickled with lying fables  that they might itch the more  the same curiosity flashing from my eyes more and more  for the shows and games of my elders",3.4,3,10,6
"158","yet those who give these shows are in such esteem  that almost all wish the same for their children  and yet are very willing that they should be beaten  if those very games detain them from the studies  whereby they would have them attain to be the givers of them",1.5,1,-1,0
"159","look with pity  lord  on these things  and deliver us who call upon thee now  deliver those too who call not on thee yet  that they may call on thee  and thou mayest deliver them",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"160","as a boy  then  i had already heard of an eternal life  promised us through the humility of the lord our god stooping to our pride  and even from the womb of my mother  who greatly hoped in thee  i was sealed with the mark of his cross and salted with his salt",2,3,2,2
"161","thou sawest  lord  how while yet a boy  being seized on a time with sudden oppression of the stomach  and like near to death thou sawest  my god  for thou wert my keeper   with what eagerness and what faith i sought  from the pious care of my mother and thy church  the mother of us all  the baptism of thy christ  my god and lord",0.75,1,2,3
"162","whereupon the mother of my flesh  being much troubled  since  with a heart pure in thy faith  she even more lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation   would in eager haste have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the health giving sacraments  confessing thee  lord jesus  for the remission of sins  unless i had suddenly recovered",3.4,2,3,8
"163","and so  as if i must needs be again polluted should i live  my cleansing was deferred  because the defilements of sin would  after that washing  bring greater and more perilous guilt",-2.25,-3,-4,-1

"517","for other than this  that which really is i knew not  and was  as it were through sharpness of wit  persuaded to assent to foolish deceivers  when they asked me   whence is evil    is god bounded by a bodily shape  and has hairs and nails    are they to be esteemed righteous who had many wives at once  and did kill men  and sacrifice living creatures",-0.95,-3,-5,2
"518","at which i  in my ignorance  was much troubled  and departing from the truth  seemed to myself to be making towards it  because as yet i knew not that evil was nothing but a privation of good  until at last a thing ceases altogether to be  which how should i see  the sight of whose eyes reached only to bodies  and of my mind to a phantasm",-0.75,-2,-3,0
"519","and i knew not god to be a spirit  not one who hath parts extended in length and breadth  or whose being was bulk  for every bulk is less in a part than in the whole  and if it be infinite  it must be less in such part as is defined by a certain space  than in its infinitude  and so is not wholly every where  as spirit  as god",1.9,0,3,3
"520","and what that should be in us  by which we were like to god  and might be rightly said to be after the image of god  i was altogether ignorant",0,1,1,1
"521","nor knew i that true inward righteousness which judgeth not according to custom  but out of the most rightful law of god almighty  whereby the ways of places and times were disposed according to those times and places  itself meantime being the same always and every where  not one thing in one place  and another in another  according to which abraham  and isaac  and jacob  and moses  and david  were righteous  and all those commended by the mouth of god  but were judged unrighteous by silly men  judging out of man own judgment  and measuring by their own petty habits  the moral habits of the whole human race",3.1,1,8,5
"522","as if in an armory  one ignorant what were adapted to each part should cover his head with greaves  or seek to be shod with a helmet  and complain that they fitted not  or as if on a day when business is publicly stopped in the afternoon  one were angered at not being allowed to keep open shop  because he had been in the forenoon  or when in one house he observeth some servant take a thing in his hand  which the butler is not suffered to meddle with  or something permitted out of doors  which is forbidden in the dining room  and should be angry  that in one house  and one family  the same thing is not allotted every where  and to all",-4.6,-6,-15,-3
"523","even such are they who are fretted to hear something to have been lawful for righteous men formerly  which now is not  or that god  for certain temporal respects  commanded them one thing  and these another  obeying both the same righteousness  whereas they see  in one man  and one day  and one house  different things to be fit for different members  and a thing formerly lawful  after a certain time not so  in one corner permitted or commanded  but in another rightly forbidden and punished",2.35,3,3,4
"524","is justice therefore various or mutable",1,0,2,2
"525","no  but the times  over which it presides  flow not evenly  because they are times",0.4,1,-1,1

"530","still i saw not how that righteousness  which good and holy men obeyed  did far more excellently and sublimely contain in one all those things which god commanded  and in no part varied  although in varying times it prescribed not every thing at once  but apportioned and enjoined what was fit for each",3.8,4,6,3
"531","and i in my blindness  censured the holy fathers  not only wherein they made use of things present as god commanded and inspired them  but also wherein they were foretelling things to come  as god was revealing in them",0.2,1,3,3
"532","can it at any time or place be unjust to love god with all his heart  with all his soul  and with all his mind  and his neighbour as himself",0,0,2,1
"533","therefore are those foul offences which be against nature  to be every where and at all times detested and punished  such as were those of the men of sodom  which should all nations commit  they should all stand guilty of the same crime  by the law of god  which hath not so made men that they should so abuse one another",-5,-5,-14,-4
"534","for even that intercourse which should be between god and us is violated  when that same nature  of which he is author  is polluted by perversity of lust",-3,-1,-3,2
"535","but those actions which are offences against the customs of men  are to be avoided according to the customs severally prevailing  so that a thing agreed upon  and confirmed  by custom or law of any city or nation  may not be violated at the lawless pleasure of any  whether native or foreigner",-1.25,0,-1,1
"536","for any part which harmoniseth not with its whole  is offensive",-0.5,-1,-2,-1
"537","but when god commands a thing to be done  against the customs or compact of any people  though it were never by them done heretofore  it is to be done  and if intermitted  it is to be restored  and if never ordained  is now to be ordained",1.5,2,2,2
"538","for lawful if it be for a king  in the state which he reigns over  to command that which no one before him  nor he himself heretofore  had commanded  and to obey him cannot be against the common weal of the state  nay  it were against it if he were not obeyed  for to obey princes is a general compact of human society   how much more unhesitatingly ought we to obey god  in all which he commands  the ruler of all his creatures",1.15,2,0,3

"546","so then by a humble devoutness we return to thee  and thou cleansest us from our evil habits  and art merciful to their sins who confess  and hearest the groaning of the prisoner  and loosest us from the chains which we made for ourselves  if we lift not up against thee the horns of an unreal liberty  suffering the loss of all  through covetousness of more  by loving more our own private good than thee  the good of all",-0.45,1,-8,1
"547","amidst these offences of foulness and violence  and so many iniquities  are sins of men  who are on the whole making proficiency  which by those that judge rightly  are  after the rule of perfection  discommended  yet the persons commended  upon hope of future fruit  as in the green blade of growing corn",3,1,1,4
"548","and there are some  resembling offences of foulness or violence  which yet are no sins  because they offend neither thee  our lord god  nor human society  when  namely  things fitting for a given period are obtained for the service of life  and we know not whether out of a lust of having  or when things are  for the sake of correction  by constituted authority punished  and we know not whether out of a lust of hurting",-2.35,-3,-12,-3
"549","many an action then which in men own sight is disapproved  is by thy testimony approved  and many  by men praised  are  thou being witness  condemned  because the show of the action  and the mind of the doer  and the unknown exigency of the period  severally vary",-0.5,-2,1,1
"550","but when thou on a sudden commandest an unwonted and unthought of thing  yea  although thou hast sometime forbidden it  and still for the time hidest the reason of thy command  and it be against the ordinance of some society of men  who doubts but it is to be done  seeing that society of men is just which serves thee",-0.9,-2,-3,1

"575","at the same time he told her  how himself  when a little one  had by his seduced mother been consigned over to the manichees  and had not only read  but frequently copied out almost all  their books  and had  without any argument or proof from any one  seen how much that sect was to be avoided  and had avoided it",-1.4,0,-2,-1

"597","of whom when i had demanded  how then could many true things be foretold by it  he answered me  as he could   that the force of chance  diffused throughout the whole order of things  brought this about  for if when a man by haphazard opens the pages of some poet  who sang and thought of something wholly different  a verse oftentimes fell out  wondrously agreeable to the present business  it were not to be wondered at  if out of the soul of man  unconscious what takes place in it  by some higher instinct an answer should be given  by hap  not by art  corresponding to the business and actions of the demander",0.35,-1,5,1

"811","i would lay open before my god that nine and twentieth year of mine age",0,0,1,1
"812","there had then come to carthage a certain bishop of the manichees  faustus by name  a great snare of the devil  and many were entangled by him through that lure of his smooth language  which though i did commend  yet could i separate from the truth of the things which i was earnest to learn  nor did i so much regard the service of oratory as the science which this faustus  so praised among them  set before me to feed upon",3.45,2,11,1

"835","wherefore this wanderer to this end spake much of these things  that convicted by those who had truly learned them  it might be manifest what understanding he had in the other abstruser things",1,0,-2,1

"837","when then he was found out to have taught falsely of the heaven and stars  and of the motions of the sun and moon  although these things pertain not to the doctrine of religion   yet his sacrilegious presumption would become evident enough  seeing he delivered things which not only he knew not  but which were falsified  with so mad a vanity of pride  that he sought to ascribe them to himself  as to a divine person",0.75,1,-6,1

"842","but i had not as yet clearly ascertained whether the vicissitudes of longer and shorter days and nights  and of day and night itself  with the eclipses of the greater lights  and whatever else of the kind i had read of in other books  might be explained consistently with his sayings  so that  if they by any means might  it should still remain a question to me whether it were so or no  but i might  on account of his reputed sanctity  rest my credence upon his authority",3.3,3,6,6
"843","and for almost all those nine years  wherein with unsettled mind i had been their disciple  i had longed but too intensely for the coming of this faustus",-1,-1,-1,-1
"844","for the rest of the sect  whom by chance i had lighted upon  when unable to solve my objections about these things  still held out to me the coming of this faustus  by conference with whom these and greater difficulties  if i had them  were to be most readily and abundantly cleared",0.7,-1,5,1
"845","when then he came  i found him a man of pleasing discourse  and who could speak fluently and in better terms  yet still but the self same things which they were will not to say",2.4,2,2,1
"846","but what availed the utmost neatness of the cup bearer to my thirst for a more precious draught",0.65,0,0,0
"847","mine ears were already cloyed with the like  nor did they seem to me therefore better  because better said  nor therefore true  because eloquent  nor the soul therefore wise  because the face was comely  and the language graceful",4.15,6,8,4
"848","but they who held him out to me were no good judges of things  and therefore to them he appeared understanding and wise  because in words pleasing",3.25,3,2,2
"849","i felt however that another sort of people were suspicious even of truth  and refused to assent to it  if delivered in a smooth and copious discourse",0.5,-1,-4,0
"850","but thou  o my god  hadst already taught me by wonderful and secret ways  and therefore i believe that thou taughtest me  because it is truth  nor is there besides thee any teacher of truth  where or whencesoever it may shine upon us",2.5,2,5,5
"851","of thyself therefore had i now learned  that neither ought any thing to seem to be spoken truly  because eloquently  nor therefore falsely  because the utterance of the lips is inharmonious  nor  again  therefore true  because rudely delivered  nor therefore false  because the language is rich  but that wisdom and folly are as wholesome and unwholesome food  and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country vessels  either kind of meats may be served up in either kind of dishes",3.45,3,4,3
"852","that greediness then  wherewith i had of so long time expected that man  was delighted verily with his action and feeling when disputing  and his choice and readiness of words to clothe his ideas",3.45,1,2,5
"853","i was then delighted  and  with many others and more than they  did i praise and extol him",1.9,3,6,2
"854","it troubled me  however  that in the assembly of his auditors  i was not allowed to put in and communicate those questions that troubled me  in familiar converse with him",0.9,-1,-2,3
"855","which when i might  and with my friends began to engage his ears at such times as it was not unbecoming for him to discuss with me  and had brought forward such things as moved me  i found him first utterly ignorant of liberal sciences  save grammar  and that but in an ordinary way",0.9,-2,1,2
"856","but because he had read some of tully own orations  a very few books of seneca  some things of the poets  and such few volumes of his own sect as were written in latin and neatly  and was daily practised in speaking  he acquired a certain eloquence  which proved the more pleasing and seductive because under the guidance of a good wit  and with a kind of natural gracefulness",6.3,5,7,6
"857","is it not thus  as i recall it  o lord my god  thou judge of my conscience",0,0,1,2
"858","before thee is my heart  and my remembrance  who didst at that time direct me by the hidden mystery of thy providence  and didst set those shameful errors of mine before my face  that i might see and hate them",-2.55,-3,-7,-3
"859","for after it was clear that he was ignorant of those arts in which i thought he excelled  i began to despair of his opening and solving the difficulties which perplexed me  of which indeed however ignorant  he might have held the truths of piety  had he not been a manichee",-0.65,-1,-5,-3
"860","for their books are fraught with prolix fables  of the heaven  and stars  sun  and moon  and i now no longer thought him able satisfactorily to decide what i much desired  whether  on comparison of these things with the calculations i had elsewhere read  the account given in the books of manichaeus were preferable  or at least as good",3.95,3,6,2
"861","which when i proposed to be considered and discussed  he  so far modestly  shrunk from the burthen",-0.5,0,0,-1
"862","for he knew that he knew not these things  and was not ashamed to confess it",-1.5,-2,-2,-1
"863","for he was not one of those talking persons  many of whom i had endured  who undertook to teach me these things  and said nothing",0.4,0,0,1
"864","but this man had a heart  though not right towards thee  yet neither altogether treacherous to himself",0.3,0,0,-1
"865","for he was not altogether ignorant of his own ignorance  nor would he rashly be entangled in a dispute  whence he could neither retreat nor extricate himself fairly",-3.1,-3,-7,-2
"866","even for this i liked him the better",1.3,2,4,0
"867","for fairer is the modesty of a candid mind  than the knowledge of those things which i desired  and such i found him  in all the more difficult and subtile questions",2.6,0,1,4
"868","my zeal for the writings of manichaeus being thus blunted  and despairing yet more of their other teachers  seeing that in divers things which perplexed me  he  so renowned among them  had so turned out  i began to engage with him in the study of that literature  on which he also was much set  and which as rhetoric reader i was at that time teaching young students at carthage   and to read with him  either what himself desired to hear  or such as i judged fit for his genius",1.95,0,-1,4
"869","but all my efforts whereby i had purposed to advance in that sect  upon knowledge of that man  came utterly to an end  not that i detached myself from them altogether  but as one finding nothing better  i had settled to be content meanwhile with what i had in whatever way fallen upon  unless by chance something more eligible should dawn upon me",2.8,0,1,5
"870","thus  that faustus  to so many a snare of death  had now neither willing nor witting it  begun to loosen that wherein i was taken",-0.45,-1,-2,-2
"871","for thy hands  o my god  in the secret purpose of thy providence  did not forsake my soul  and out of my mother own heart own blood  through her tears night and day poured out  was a sacrifice offered for me unto thee  and thou didst deal with me by wondrous ways",0.55,1,-1,2
"872","thou didst it  o my god  for the steps of a man are ordered by the lord  and he shall dispose his way",0,0,1,1
"873","or how shall we obtain salvation  but from thy hand  re making what it made",1,0,2,1
"874","thou didst deal with me  that i should be persuaded to go to rome  and to teach there rather  what i was teaching at carthage",0.65,0,0,2
"875","and how i was persuaded to this  i will not neglect to confess to thee  because herein also the deepest recesses of thy wisdom  and thy most present mercy to us  must be considered and confessed",0.75,0,1,2
"876","i did not wish therefore to go to rome  because higher gains and higher dignities were warranted me by my friends who persuaded me to this  though even these things had at that time an influence over my mind   but my chief and almost only reason was  that i heard that young men studied there more peacefully  and were kept quiet under a restraint of more regular discipline  so that they did not  at their pleasures  petulantly rush into the school of one whose pupils they were not  nor were even admitted without his permission",4.8,3,4,4
"877","whereas at carthage there reigns among the scholars a most disgraceful and unruly licence",-0.4,-2,0,-2
"878","they burst in audaciously  and with gestures almost frantic  disturb all order which any one hath established for the good of his scholars",0.25,-2,0,1
"879","divers outrages they commit  with a wonderful stolidity  punishable by law  did not custom uphold them  that custom evincing them to be the more miserable  in that they now do as lawful what by thy eternal law shall never be lawful  and they think they do it unpunished  whereas they are punished with the very blindness whereby they do it  and suffer incomparably worse than what they do",-4.2,-3,-5,-3
"880","the manners then which  when a student  i would not make my own  i was fain as a teacher to endure in others  and so i was well pleased to go where  all that knew it  assured me that the like was not done",3.45,3,5,6
"881","but thou  my refuge and my portion in the land of the living  that i might change my earthly dwelling for the salvation of my soul  at carthage didst goad me  that i might thereby be torn from it  and at rome didst proffer me allurements  whereby i might be drawn thither  by men in love with a dying life  the one doing frantic  the other promising vain  things  and  to correct my steps  didst secretly use their and my own perverseness",0.75,-1,-1,1
"882","for both they who disturbed my quiet were blinded with a disgraceful frenzy  and they who invited me elsewhere savoured of earth",-2.75,-2,-5,-3
"883","and i  who here detested real misery  was there seeking unreal happiness",-1.15,0,1,1
"884","but why i went hence  and went thither  thou knewest  o god  yet showedst it neither to me  nor to my mother  who grievously bewailed my journey  and followed me as far as the sea",-0.6,-1,1,3
"885","but i deceived her  holding me by force  that either she might keep me back or go with me  and i feigned that i had a friend whom i could not leave  till he had a fair wind to sail",-0.65,1,-1,-2
"886","and i lied to my mother  and such a mother  and escaped  for this also hast thou mercifully forgiven me  preserving me  thus full of execrable defilements  from the waters of the sea  for the water of thy grace  whereby when i was cleansed  the streams of my mother own eyes should be dried  with which for me she daily watered the ground under her face",0.5,1,-1,4
"887","and yet refusing to return without me  i scarcely persuaded her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship  where was an oratory in memory of the blessed cyprian",-0.25,-3,-3,0
"888","that night i privily departed  but she was not behind in weeping and prayer",-0.75,0,-2,-1
"889","and what  o lord  was she with so many tears asking of thee  but that thou wouldest not suffer me to sail",-1.55,-1,-4,-1
"890","but thou  in the depth of thy counsels and hearing the main point of her desire  regardest not what she then asked  that thou mightest make me what she ever asked",0.75,0,1,1
"891","the wind blew and swelled our sails  and withdrew the shore from our sight  and she on the morrow was there  frantic with sorrow  and with complaints and groans filled thine ears  who didst then disregard them  whilst through my desires  thou wert hurrying me to end all desire  and the earthly part of her affection to me was chastened by the allotted scourge of sorrows",-3.15,-5,-5,-3
"892","for she loved my being with her  as mothers do  but much more than many  and she knew not how great joy thou wert about to work for her out of my absence",1.5,3,9,0
"893","she knew not  therefore did she weep and wail  and by this agony there appeared in her the inheritance of eve  with sorrow seeking what in sorrow she had brought forth",-2.65,-4,-4,-3
"894","and yet  after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness  she betook herself again to intercede to thee for me  went to her wonted place  and i to rome",-1.5,-2,-2,-2
"895","and lo  there was i received by the scourge of bodily sickness  and i was going down to hell  carrying all the sins which i had committed  both against thee  and myself  and others  many and grievous  over and above that bond of original sin  whereby we all die in adam",-2.95,-6,-12,-4
"896","for thou hadst not forgiven me any of these things in christ  nor had he abolished by his cross the enmity which by my sins i had incurred with thee",-0.1,-1,-2,-1
"897","for how should he  by the crucifixion of a phantasm  which i believed him to be",0,0,0,-1
"898","so true  then  was the death of my soul  as that of his flesh seemed to me false  and how true the death of his body  so false was the life of my soul  which did not believe it",-0.85,-2,-1,0
"899","and now the fever heightening  i was parting and departing for ever",-0.8,-1,-2,0
"900","for had i then parted hence  whither had i departed  but into fire and torments  such as my misdeeds deserved in the truth of thy appointment",0.75,0,-2,1
"901","and this she knew not  yet in absence prayed for me",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"902","but thou  everywhere present  heardest her where she was  and  where i was  hadst compassion upon me  that i should recover the health of my body  though frenzied as yet in my sacrilegious heart",1.5,1,2,1
"903","for i did not in all that danger desire thy baptism  and i was better as a boy  when i begged it of my mother own piety  as i have before recited and confessed",1.4,1,1,0
"904","but i had grown up to my own shame  and i madly scoffed at the prescripts of thy medicine  who wouldest not suffer me  being such  to die a double death",-3.25,-5,-12,-4
"905","with which wound had my mother own heart been pierced  it could never be healed",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"906","for i cannot express the affection she bore to me  and with how much more vehement anguish she was now in labour of me in the spirit  than at her childbearing in the flesh",-0.5,-2,-1,-1
"907","i see not then how she should have been healed  had such a death of mine stricken through the bowels of her love",-0.9,-1,-1,0
"908","and where would have been those her so strong and unceasing prayers  unintermitting to thee alone",-0.1,1,0,0
"909","but wouldest thou  god of mercies  despise the contrite and humbled heart of that chaste and sober widow  so frequent in almsdeeds  so full of duty and service to thy saints  no day intermitting the oblation at thine altar  twice a day  morning and evening  without any intermission  coming to thy church  not for idle tattlings and old wives  fables  but that she might hear thee in thy discourses  and thou her in her prayers",0.7,-2,0,3
"910","couldest thou despise and reject from thy aid the tears of such an one  wherewith she begged of thee not gold or silver  nor any mutable or passing good  but the salvation of her son own soul",0.95,0,4,3
"911","thou  by whose gift she was such",0.5,0,2,1
"912","never  lord",0,0,0,0

"914","far be it that thou shouldest deceive her in thy visions and answers  some whereof i have  some i have not mentioned  which she laid up in her faithful heart  and ever praying  urged upon thee  as thine own handwriting",0.1,0,2,0
"915","for thou  because thy mercy endureth for ever  vouchsafest to those to whom thou forgivest all of their debts  to become also a debtor by thy promises",0.1,1,3,0
"916","thou recoveredst me then of that sickness  and healedst the son of thy handmaid  for the time in body  that he might live  for thee to bestow upon him a better and more abiding health",0.05,0,0,-1
"917","and even then  at rome  i joined myself to those deceiving and deceived  holy ones   not with their disciples only  of which number was he  in whose house i had fallen sick and recovered   but also with those whom they call  the elect",-1.3,-2,-10,0
"918","for i still thought  that it was not we that sin  but that i know not what other nature sinned in us   and it delighted my pride  to be free from blame  and when i had done any evil  not to confess i had done any  that thou mightest heal my soul because it had sinned against thee  but i loved to excuse it  and to accuse i know not what other thing  which was with me  but which i was not",-1.25,-1,-3,-1
"919","but in truth it was wholly i  and mine impiety had divided me against myself  and that sin was the more incurable  whereby i did not judge myself a sinner  and execrable iniquity it was  that i had rather have thee  thee  o god almighty  to be overcome in me to my destruction  than myself of thee to salvation",-1.4,-4,-2,-1
"920","not as yet then hadst thou set a watch before my mouth  and a door of safe keeping around my lips  that my heart might not turn aside to wicked speeches  to make excuses of sins  with men that work iniquity  and  therefore  was i still united with their elect",0.35,-1,-2,1
"921","but now despairing to make proficiency in that false doctrine  even those things  with which if i should find no better  i had resolved to rest contented  i now held more laxly and carelessly",1.3,-1,-1,1
"922","for there half arose a thought in me that those philosophers  whom they call academics  were wiser than the rest  for that they held men ought to doubt everything  and laid down that no truth can be comprehended by man  for so  not then understanding even their meaning  i also was clearly convinced that they thought  as they are commonly reported",2.35,0,0,2
"923","yet did i freely and openly discourage that host of mine from that over confidence which i perceived him to have in those fables  which the books of manichaeus are full of",1.85,1,2,2
"924","yet i lived in more familiar friendship with them  than with others who were not of this heresy",0.8,-1,2,1
"925","nor did i maintain it with my ancient eagerness  still my intimacy with that sect  rome secretly harbouring many of them  made me slower to seek any other way  especially since i despaired of finding the truth  from which they had turned me aside  in thy church  o lord of heaven and earth  creator of all things visible and invisible  and it seemed to me very unseemly to believe thee to have the shape of human flesh  and to be bounded by the bodily lineaments of our members",2.8,0,4,3
"926","and because  when i wished to think on my god  i knew not what to think of  but a mass of bodies  for what was not such did not seem to me to be anything   this was the greatest  and almost only because of my inevitable error",-1.1,-1,2,0
"927","for hence i believed evil also to be some such kind of substance  and to have its own foul and hideous bulk  whether gross  which they called earth  or thin and subtile  like the body of the air   which they imagine to be some malignant mind  creeping through that earth",-3.35,-5,-7,-3
"928","and because a piety  such as it was  constrained me to believe that the good god never created any evil nature  i conceived two masses  contrary to one another  both unbounded  but the evil narrower  the good more expansive",0.4,1,-1,0
"929","and from this pestilent beginning  the other sacrilegious conceits followed on me",-1,-1,0,0
"930","for when my mind endeavoured to recur to the catholic faith  i was driven back  since that was not the catholic faith which i thought to be so",0,1,1,1
"931","and i seemed to myself more reverential  if i believed of thee  my god  to whom thy mercies confess out of my mouth   as unbounded  at least on other sides  although on that one where the mass of evil was opposed to thee  i was constrained to confess thee bounded  than if on all sides i should imagine thee to be bounded by the form of a human body",-2.55,-2,-4,-2
"932","and it seemed to me better to believe thee to have created no evil  which to me ignorant seemed not some only  but a bodily substance  because i could not conceive of mind unless as a subtile body  and that diffused in definite spaces   than to believe the nature of evil  such as i conceived it  could come from thee",-0.35,-1,-4,-1
"933","yea  and our saviour himself  thy only begotten  i believed to have been reached forth  as it were  for our salvation  out of the mass of thy most lucid substance  so as to believe nothing of him  but what i could imagine in my vanity",0.75,0,3,1
"934","his nature then  being such  i thought could not be born of the virgin mary  without being mingled with the flesh  and how that which i had so figured to myself could be mingled  and not defiled  i saw not",0.4,0,0,1
"935","i feared therefore to believe him born in the flesh  lest i should be forced to believe him defiled by the flesh",-0.5,0,-1,-1
"936","now will thy spiritual ones mildly and lovingly smile upon me  if they shall read these my confessions",0.6,1,2,1
"937","yet such was i",0,0,0,0
"938","furthermore  what the manichees had criticised in thy scriptures  i thought could not be defended  yet at times verily i had a wish to confer upon these several points with some one very well skilled in those books  and to make trial what he thought thereon  for the words of one helpidius  as he spoke and disputed face to face against the said manichees  had begun to stir me even at carthage  in that he had produced things out of the scriptures  not easily withstood  the manichees  answer whereto seemed to me weak",2.15,0,-5,1
"939","and this answer they liked not to give publicly  but only to us in private",0.5,1,2,0
"940","it was  that the scriptures of the new testament had been corrupted by i know not whom  who wished to engraff the law of the jews upon the christian faith  yet themselves produced not any uncorrupted copies",-0.2,0,-2,1
"941","but i  conceiving of things corporeal only  was mainly held down  vehemently oppressed and in a manner suffocated by those  masses   panting under which after the breath of thy truth  i could not breathe it pure and untainted",0.75,0,-1,2
"942","i began then diligently to practise that for which i came to rome  to teach rhetoric  and first  to gather some to my house  to whom  and through whom  i had begun to be known  when lo  i found other offences committed in rome  to which i was not exposed in africa",1.35,0,-2,3
"943","true  those  subvertings  by profligate young men were not here practised  as was told me  but on a sudden  said they  to avoid paying their master own stipend  a number of youths plot together  and remove to another  breakers of faith  who for love of money hold justice cheap",2,1,7,4
"944","these also my heart hated  though not with a perfect hatred  for perchance i hated them more because i was to suffer by them  than because they did things utterly unlawful",-1.9,-4,-5,-2
"945","of a truth such are base persons  and they go a whoring from thee  loving these fleeting mockeries of things temporal  and filthy lucre  which fouls the hand that grasps it  hugging the fleeting world  and despising thee  who abidest  and recallest  and forgivest the adulteress soul of man  when she returns to thee",-1.15,-2,0,1
"946","and now i hate such depraved and crooked persons  though i love them if corrigible  so as to prefer to money the learning which they acquire  and to learning  thee  o god  the truth and fulness of assured good  and most pure peace",5.6,2,7,8
"947","but then i rather for my own sake misliked them evil  than liked and wished them good for thine",0.5,1,2,0
"948","when therefore they of milan had sent to rome to the prefect of the city  to furnish them with a rhetoric reader for their city  and sent him at the public expense  i made application  through those very persons  intoxicated with manichaean vanities  to be freed wherefrom i was to go  neither of us however knowing it  that symmachus  then prefect of the city  would try me by setting me some subject  and so send me",0.75,0,0,1
"949","to milan i came  to ambrose the bishop  known to the whole world as among the best of men  thy devout servant  whose eloquent discourse did then plentifully dispense unto thy people the flour of thy wheat  the gladness of thy oil  and the sober inebriation of thy wine",2.25,3,3,2
"950","to him was i unknowing led by thee  that by him i might knowingly be led to thee",0.4,1,0,0
"951","that man of god received me as a father  and showed me an episcopal kindness on my coming",1.1,1,3,3
"952","thenceforth i began to love him  at first indeed not as a teacher of the truth  which i utterly despaired of in thy church   but as a person kind towards myself",2.2,0,5,5
"953","and i listened diligently to him preaching to the people  not with that intent i ought  but  as it were  trying his eloquence  whether it answered the fame thereof  or flowed fuller or lower than was reported  and i hung on his words attentively  but of the matter i was as a careless and scornful looker on  and i was delighted with the sweetness of his discourse  more recondite  yet in manner less winning and harmonious  than that of faustus",4.1,4,7,3
"954","of the matter  however  there was no comparison  for the one was wandering amid manichaean delusions  the other teaching salvation most soundly",0.25,0,2,1
"955","but salvation is far from sinners  such as i then stood before him  and yet was i drawing nearer by little and little  and unconsciously",1,0,2,1
"956","for though i took no pains to learn what he spake  but only to hear how he spake  for that empty care alone was left me  despairing of a way  open for man  to thee   yet together with the words which i would choose  came also into my mind the things which i would refuse  for i could not separate them",-1.3,-3,-7,-3
"957","and while i opened my heart to admit  how eloquently he spake   there also entered  how truly he spake   but this by degrees",1.4,1,-1,0
"958","for first  these things also had now begun to appear to me capable of defence  and the catholic faith  for which i had thought nothing could be said against the manichees  objections  i now thought might be maintained without shamelessness  especially after i had heard one or two places of the old testament resolved  and ofttimes  in a figure   which when i understood literally  i was slain spiritually",0.1,0,4,1
"959","very many places then of those books having been explained  i now blamed my despair  in believing that no answer could be given to such as hated and scoffed at the law and the prophets",-1.95,-2,-9,0
"960","yet did i not therefore then see that the catholic way was to be held  because it also could find learned maintainers  who could at large and with some show of reason answer objections  nor that what i held was therefore to be condemned  because both sides could be maintained",-0.5,-2,-2,1
"961","for the catholic because seemed to me in such sort not vanquished  as still not as yet to be victorious",0.5,1,0,1
"962","hereupon i earnestly bent my mind  to see if in any way i could by any certain proof convict the manichees of falsehood",-0.4,-1,1,-1
"963","could i once have conceived a spiritual substance  all their strongholds had been beaten down  and cast utterly out of my mind  but i could not",-0.7,0,-2,1
"964","notwithstanding  concerning the frame of this world  and the whole of nature  which the senses of the flesh can reach to  as i more and more considered and compared things  i judged the tenets of most of the philosophers to have been much more probable",0,0,1,0
"965","so then after the manner of the academics  as they are supposed  doubting of every thing  and wavering between all  i settled so far  that the manichees were to be abandoned  judging that  even while doubting  i might not continue in that sect  to which i already preferred some of the philosophers  to which philosophers notwithstanding  for that they were without the saving name of christ  i utterly refused to commit the cure of my sick soul",-1.2,-2,-7,-3
"966","i determined therefore so long to be a catechumen in the catholic church  to which i had been commended by my parents  till something certain should dawn upon me  whither i might steer my course",2.9,1,5,3
"967","when then my mother had once  as she was will not in afric  brought to the churches built in memory of the saints  certain cakes  and bread and wine  and was forbidden by the door keeper  so soon as she knew that the bishop had forbidden this  she so piously and obediently embraced his wishes  that i myself wondered how readily she censured her own practice  rather than discuss his prohibition",0.5,0,0,1
"968","for wine bibbing did not lay siege to her spirit  nor did love of wine provoke her to hatred of the truth  as it doth too many  both men and women   who revolt at a lesson of sobriety  as men well drunk at a draught mingled with water",0.85,-3,-2,3
"969","but she  when she had brought her basket with the accustomed festival food  to be but tasted by herself  and then given away  never joined therewith more than one small cup of wine  diluted according to her own abstemious habits  which for courtesy she would taste",2,0,2,3
"970","and if there were many churches of the departed saints that were to be honoured in that manner  she still carried round that same one cup  to be used every where  and this  though not only made very watery  but unpleasantly heated with carrying about  she would distribute to those about her by small sips  for she sought there devotion  not pleasure",0.8,1,7,-3
"971","so soon  then  as she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous preacher and most pious prelate  even to those that would use it soberly  lest so an occasion of excess might be given to the drunken  and for these  as it were  anniversary funeral solemnities did much resemble the superstition of the gentiles  she most willingly forbare it  and for a basket filled with fruits of the earth  she had learned to bring to the churches of the martyrs a breast filled with more purified petitions  and to give what she could to the poor  that so the communication of the lord own body might be there rightly celebrated  where  after the example of his passion  the martyrs had been sacrificed and crowned",0.75,0,1,5
"972","but yet it seems to me  o lord my god  and thus thinks my heart of it in thy sight  that perhaps she would not so readily have yielded to the cutting off of this custom  had it been forbidden by another  whom she loved not as ambrose  whom  for my salvation  she loved most entirely  and he her again  for her most religious conversation  whereby in good works  so fervent in spirit  she was constant at church  so that  when he saw me  he often burst forth into her praises  congratulating me that i had such a mother  not knowing what a son she had in me  who doubted of all these things  and imagined the way to life could not be found out",5.5,4,11,8
"973","nor did i yet groan in my prayers  that thou wouldest help me  but my spirit was wholly intent on learning  and restless to dispute",-0.75,-2,-3,0
"974","and ambrose himself  as the world counts happy  i esteemed a happy man  whom personages so great held in such honour  only his celibacy seemed to me a painful course",1.55,2,8,0
"975","but what hope he bore within him  what struggles he had against the temptations which beset his very excellencies  or what comfort in adversities  and what sweet joys thy bread had for the hidden mouth of his spirit  when chewing the cud thereof  i neither could conjecture  nor had experienced",1,-1,3,3
"976","nor did he know the tides of my feelings  or the abyss of my danger",-1.5,-2,-2,-2
"977","for i could not ask of him  what i would as i would  being shut out both from his ear and speech by multitudes of busy people  whose weaknesses he served",-0.75,-1,-2,1
"978","with whom when he was not taken up  which was but a little time   he was either refreshing his body with the sustenance absolutely necessary  or his mind with reading",0.6,1,0,2
"979","but when he was reading  his eye glided over the pages  and his heart searched out the sense  but his voice and tongue were at rest",0.1,0,0,3
"980","ofttimes when we had come  for no man was forbidden to enter  nor was it his will not that any who came should be announced to him   we saw him thus reading to himself  and never otherwise  and having long sat silent  for who durst intrude on one so intent   we were fain to depart  conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained  free from the din of others  business  for the recruiting of his mind  he was loth to be taken off  and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he read should deliver any thing obscurely  some attentive or perplexed hearer should desire him to expound it  or to discuss some of the harder questions  so that his time being thus spent  he could not turn over so many volumes as he desired  although the preserving of his voice  which a very little speaking would weaken  might be the truer reason for his reading to himself",-0.4,-2,-3,1
"981","but with what intent soever he did it  certainly in such a man it was good",0.75,1,3,1
"982","i however certainly had no opportunity of enquiring what i wished of that so holy oracle of thine  his breast  unless the thing might be answered briefly",1.15,1,1,3
"983","but those tides in me  to be poured out to him  required his full leisure  and never found it",1.4,0,0,3
"984","i heard him indeed every lord own day  rightly expounding the word of truth among the people  and i was more and more convinced that all the knots of those crafty calumnies  which those our deceivers had knit against the divine books  could be unravelled",2.1,-1,1,3
"985","but when i understood withal  that  man created by thee  after thine own image   was not so understood by thy spiritual sons  whom of the catholic mother thou hast born again through grace  as though they believed and conceived of thee as bounded by human shape  although what a spiritual substance should be i had not even a faint or shadowy notion   yet  with joy i blushed at having so many years barked not against the catholic faith  but against the fictions of carnal imaginations",-0.75,2,5,5
"986","for so rash and impious had i been  that what i ought by enquiring to have learned  i had pronounced on  condemning",-2,-2,-2,-1
"987","for thou  most high  and most near  most secret  and most present  who hast not limbs some larger  some smaller  but art wholly every where  and no where in space  art not of such corporeal shape  yet hast thou made man after thine own image  and behold  from head to foot is he contained in space",0.85,0,-1,4
"988","ignorant then how this thy image should subsist  i should have knocked and proposed the doubt  how it was to be believed  not insultingly opposed it  as if believed",-3.3,-3,-3,-4
"989","doubt  then  what to hold for certain  the more sharply gnawed my heart  the more ashamed i was  that so long deluded and deceived by the promise of certainties  i had with childish error and vehemence  prated of so many uncertainties",-3.95,-5,-8,-4
"990","for that they were falsehoods became clear to me later",0.5,1,1,0
"991","however i was certain that they were uncertain  and that i had formerly accounted them certain  when with a blind contentiousness  i accused thy catholic church  whom i now discovered  not indeed as yet to teach truly  but at least not to teach that for which i had grievously censured her",-1.7,-3,-3,-1
"992","so i was confounded  and converted  and i joyed  o my god  that the one only church  the body of thine only son  wherein the name of christ had been put upon me as an infant   had no taste for infantine conceits  nor in her sound doctrine maintained any tenet which should confine thee  the creator of all  in space  however great and large  yet bounded every where by the limits of a human form",0.55,-1,2,1
"993","i joyed also that the old scriptures of the law and the prophets were laid before me  not now to be perused with that eye to which before they seemed absurd  when i reviled thy holy ones for so thinking  whereas indeed they thought not so  and with joy i heard ambrose in his sermons to the people  oftentimes most diligently recommend this text for a rule  the letter killeth  but the spirit giveth life  whilst he drew aside the mystic veil  laying open spiritually what  according to the letter  seemed to teach something unsound  teaching herein nothing that offended me  though he taught what i knew not as yet  whether it were true",0,1,4,4
"994","for i kept my heart from assenting to any thing  fearing to fall headlong  but by hanging in suspense i was the worse killed",-2.5,-3,-8,-4
"995","for i wished to be as assured of the things i saw not  as i was that seven and three are ten",0.8,0,0,1
"996","for i was not so mad as to think that even this could not be comprehended  but i desired to have other things as clear as this  whether things corporeal  which were not present to my senses  or spiritual  whereof i knew not how to conceive  except corporeally",0.9,1,0,1
"997","and by believing might i have been cured  that so the eyesight of my soul being cleared  might in some way be directed to thy truth  which abideth always  and in no part faileth",2.3,1,0,2
"998","but as it happens that one who has tried a bad physician  fears to trust himself with a good one  so was it with the health of my soul  which could not be healed but by believing  and lest it should believe falsehoods  refused to be cured  resisting thy hands  who hast prepared the medicines of faith  and hast applied them to the diseases of the whole world  and given unto them so great authority",0.2,1,4,3
"999","being led  however  from this to prefer the catholic doctrine  i felt that her proceeding was more unassuming and honest  in that she required to be believed things not demonstrated  whether it was that they could in themselves be demonstrated but not to certain persons  or could not at all be   whereas among the manichees our credulity was mocked by a promise of certain knowledge  and then so many most fabulous and absurd things were imposed to be believed  because they could not be demonstrated",2.25,3,5,4
"1000","then thou  o lord  little by little with most tender and most merciful hand  touching and composing my heart  didst persuade me considering what innumerable things i believed  which i saw not  nor was present while they were done  as so many things in secular history  so many reports of places and of cities  which i had not seen  so many of friends  so many of physicians  so many continually of other men  which unless we should believe  we should do nothing at all in this life  lastly  with how unshaken an assurance i believed of what parents i was born  which i could not know  had i not believed upon hearsay considering all this  thou didst persuade me  that not they who believed thy books  which thou hast established in so great authority among almost all nations   but they who believed them not  were to be blamed  and that they were not to be heard  who should say to me   how knowest thou those scriptures to have been imparted unto mankind by the spirit of the one true and most true god",4.1,4,8,8
"1001","for this very thing was of all most to be believed  since no contentiousness of blasphemous questionings  of all that multitude which i had read in the self contradicting philosophers  could wring this belief from me   that thou art  whatsoever thou wert  what i knew not   and  that the government of human things belongs to thee",-0.4,-1,-1,-1
"1002","this i believed  sometimes more strongly  more weakly otherwhiles  yet i ever believed both that thou wert  and hadst a care of us  though i was ignorant  both what was to be thought of thy substance  and what way led or led back to thee",0,0,0,0
"1003","since then we were too weak by abstract reasonings to find out truth  and for this very because needed the authority of holy writ  i had now begun to believe that thou wouldest never have given such excellency of authority to that writ in all lands  hadst thou not willed thereby to be believed in  thereby sought",2.25,1,-1,3
"1004","for now what things  sounding strangely in the scripture  were will not to offend me  having heard divers of them expounded satisfactorily  i referred to the depth of the mysteries  and its authority appeared to me the more venerable  and more worthy of religious credence  in that  while it lay open to all to read  it reserved the majesty of its mysteries within its profounder meaning  stooping to all in the great plainness of its words and lowliness of its style  yet calling forth the intensest application of such as are not light of heart  that so it might receive all in its open bosom  and through narrow passages waft over towards thee some few  yet many more than if it stood not aloft on such a height of authority  nor drew multitudes within its bosom by its holy lowliness",2.35,4,3,6
"1005","these things i thought on  and thou wert with me  i sighed  and thou heardest me  i wavered  and thou didst guide me  i wandered through the broad way of the world  and thou didst not forsake me",0.1,-1,0,0
"1006","i panted after honours  gains  marriage  and thou deridedst me",1.1,1,2,1
"1007","in these desires i underwent most bitter crosses  thou being the more gracious  the less thou sufferedst aught to grow sweet to me  which was not thou",2.05,1,3,3
"1008","behold my heart  o lord  who wouldest i should remember all this  and confess to thee",-0.5,-1,0,0
"1009","let my soul cleave unto thee  now that thou hast freed it from that fast holding birdlime of death",0.05,1,-2,-1
"1010","how wretched was it  and thou didst irritate the feeling of its wound  that forsaking all else  it might be converted unto thee  who art above all  and without whom all things would be nothing  be converted  and be healed",-0.9,-3,-2,-1
"1011","how miserable was i then  and how didst thou deal with me  to make me feel my misery on that day  when i was preparing to recite a panegyric of the emperor  wherein i was to utter many a lie  and lying  was to be applauded by those who knew i lied  and my heart was panting with these anxieties  and boiling with the feverishness of consuming thoughts",-3.2,-7,-5,-3
"1012","for  passing through one of the streets of milan  i observed a poor beggar  then  i suppose  with a full belly  joking and joyous  and i sighed  and spoke to the friends around me  of the many sorrows of our frenzies  for that by all such efforts of ours  as those wherein i then toiled dragging along  under the goading of desire  the burthen of my own wretchedness  and  by dragging  augmenting it  we yet looked to arrive only at that very joyousness whither that beggar man had arrived before us  who should never perchance attain it",0.4,-4,2,1
"1013","for what he had obtained by means of a few begged pence  the same was i plotting for by many a toilsome turning and winding  the joy of a temporary felicity",2.05,2,3,2
"1014","for he verily had not the true joy  but yet i with those my ambitious designs was seeking one much less true",2.55,2,7,3
"1015","and certainly he was joyous  i anxious  he void of care  i full of fears",0,-1,3,1
"1016","but should any ask me  had i rather be merry or fearful",0,0,1,0
"1017","i would answer merry",1,1,3,1
"1018","again  if he asked had i rather be such as he was  or what i then was",0,0,0,0
"1019","i should choose to be myself  though worn with cares and fears  but out of wrong judgment  for  was it the truth",0.15,-3,-1,-1
"1020","for i ought not to prefer myself to him  because more learned than he  seeing i had no joy therein  but sought to please men by it  and that not to instruct  but simply to please",2.25,2,3,3
"1021","wherefore also thou didst break my bones with the staff of thy correction",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"1022","away with those then from my soul who say to her   it makes a difference whence a man own joy is  that beggar man joyed in drunkenness  thou desiredst to joy in glory",0.4,1,5,0
"1023","what glory  lord",0.75,1,2,1
"1024","that which is not in thee",0,0,0,0

"1028","i know it  and the joy of a faithful hope lieth incomparably beyond such vanity",1.75,0,8,2
"1029","yea  and so was he then beyond me  for he verily was the happier  not only for that he was thoroughly drenched in mirth  i disembowelled with cares  but he  by fair wishes  had gotten wine  i  by lying  was seeking for empty  swelling praise",3.6,1,10,2
"1030","much to this purpose said i then to my friends  and i often marked in them how it fared with me  and i found it went ill with me  and grieved  and doubled that very ill  and if any prosperity smiled on me  i was loth to catch at it  for almost before i could grasp it  it flew away",0.4,1,1,2
"1031","these things we  who were living as friends together  bemoaned together  but chiefly and most familiarly did i speak thereof with alypius and nebridius  of whom alypius was born in the same town with me  of persons of chief rank there  but younger than i",0.25,0,0,1
"1032","for he had studied under me  both when i first lectured in our town  and afterwards at carthage  and he loved me much  because i seemed to him kind  and learned  and i him  for his great towardliness to virtue  which was eminent enough in one of no greater years",2.75,5,10,4
"1033","yet the whirlpool of carthaginian habits  amongst whom those idle spectacles are hotly followed  had drawn him into the madness of the circus",-1.15,-2,-3,-1
"1034","but while he was miserably tossed therein  and i  professing rhetoric there  had a public school  as yet he used not my teaching  by reason of some unkindness risen betwixt his father and me  i had found then how deadly he doted upon the circus  and was deeply grieved that he seemed likely  nay  or had thrown away so great promise  yet had i no means of advising or with a sort of constraint reclaiming him  either by the kindness of a friend  or the authority of a master",1.05,1,-1,4
"1035","for i supposed that he thought of me as did his father  but he was not such  laying aside then his father own mind in that matter  he began to greet me  come sometimes into my lecture room  hear a little  and be gone",0.8,0,2,0

"1038","for as one day i sat in my accustomed place  with my scholars before me  he entered  greeted me  sat down  and applied his mind to what i then handled",1.4,0,1,0
"1039","i had by chance a passage in hand  which while i was explaining  a likeness from the circensian races occurred to me  as likely to make what i would convey pleasanter and plainer  seasoned with biting mockery of those whom that madness had enthralled  god  thou knowest that i then thought not of curing alypius of that infection",-0.75,-2,-2,-1
