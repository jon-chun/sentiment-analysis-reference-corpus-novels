10,10,115,126,137,"Hear, O God. Alas, for man's sin! So saith man, and Thou pitiest him; for Thou madest him, but sin in him Thou madest not. Who remindeth me of the sins of my infancy? for in Thy sight none is pure from sin, not even the infant whose life is but a day upon the earth. Who remindeth me? doth not each little infant, in whom I see what of myself I remember not? What then was my sin? was it that I hung upon the breast and cried? for should I now so do for food suitable to my age, justly should I be laughed at and reproved. What I then did was worthy reproof; but since I could not understand reproof, custom and reason forbade me to be reproved. For those habits, when grown, we root out and cast away. Now no man, though he prunes, wittingly casts away what is good. Or was it then good, even for a while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt? bitterly to resent, that persons free, and its own elders, yea, the very authors of its birth, served it not? that many besides, wiser than it, obeyed not the nod of its good pleasure? to do its best to strike and hurt, because commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its hurt? The weakness then of infant limbs, not its will, is its innocence. Myself have seen and known even a baby envious; it could not speak, yet it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother.

For I was no longer a speechless infant, but a speaking boy. This I remember; and have since observed how I learned to speak. It was not that my elders taught me words (as, soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by cries and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts, that so I might have my will, and yet unable to express all I willed, or to whom I willed, did myself, by the understanding which Thou, my God, gavest me, practise the sounds in my memory. When they named any thing, and as they spoke turned towards it, I saw and remembered that they called what they would point out by the name they uttered. And that they meant this thing and no other was plain from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were, of all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye, gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice, indicating the affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or shuns. And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various sentences, I collected gradually for what they stood; and having broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave utterance to my will. Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs of our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders.",passing hence from infancy i came to boyhood or rather it came to me displacing infancy nor did that depart—for whither went it—and yet it was no more for i was no longer a speechless infant but a speaking boy this i remember and have since observed how i learned to speak it was not that my elders taught me words as soon after other learning in any set method but i longing by cries and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts that so i might have my will and yet unable to express all i willed or to whom i willed did myself by the understanding which thou my god gavest me practise the sounds in my memory when they named any thing and as they spoke turned towards it i saw and remembered that they called what they would point out by the name they uttered and that they meant this thing and no other was plain from the motion of their body the natural language as it were of all nations expressed by the countenance glances of the eye gestures of the limbs and tones of the voice indicating the affections of the mind as it pursues possesses rejects or shuns and thus by constantly hearing words as they occurred in various sentences i collected gradually for what they stood and having broken in my mouth to these signs i thereby gave utterance to my will thus i exchanged with those about me these current signs of our wills and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human life yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders,279,1537,0.04999999999999982,-0.5707066731659907,-0.4594594594594595,-0.49720906391381997,0.04999999999999982,-0.6000374520873326,-0.48648648648648674,-0.5469409014107133,-90.48120007942208,-0.8512272242728159,-0.8874984103098766,-0.7770917113982079,-4.297916666666666,-1.3790749832751286,-1.3677564474286585,-1.1762679383404766,8.159000000000002,-0.3158733689082033,-0.05755623613897962,-0.2745638424820883,-6.397456665278954,-0.8082708664727849,-0.7053252098526127,-0.6423264336170704,-1.5703485305754696,-0.8800478366805875,-0.9321865638642904,-0.8221869383888172,"{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.05, 'compound': -0.8724}",-0.8724,-1.0910966019177746,-2.2115219260533103,-1.7876205682149566,-0.13282967032967033,-0.4760923447858484,-1.6306082623614169,-1.222480329201785,0.9799,0.39298080947935254,0.7905820864931338,0.7051362363631434,-0.2063892935268961,-1.056249746776677,-1.1280537788674423,-1.0825644265049978,48.50632127777562,-0.44291382134304724,0.3445769568571731,-0.4762016452419347

Difficulty, in truth, the difficulty of a foreign tongue, dashed, as it were, with gall all the sweetness of Grecian fable. For not one word of it did I understand, and to make me understand I was urged vehemently with cruel threats and punishments. Time was also (as an infant) I knew no Latin; but this I learned without fear or suffering, by mere observation, amid the caresses of my nursery and jests of friends, smiling and sportively encouraging me. This I learned without any pressure of punishment to urge me on, for my heart urged me to give birth to its conceptions, which I could only do by learning words not of those who taught, but of those who talked with me; in whose ears also I gave birth to the thoughts, whatever I conceived. No doubt, then, that a free curiosity has more force in our learning these things, than a frightful enforcement. Only this enforcement restrains the rovings of that freedom, through Thy laws, O my God, Thy laws, from the master's cane to the martyr's trials, being able to temper for us a wholesome bitter, recalling us to Thyself from that deadly pleasure which lures us from Thee.",why then did i hate the greek classics which have the like tales for homer also curiously wove the like fictions and is most sweetly vain yet was he bitter to my boyish taste and so i suppose would virgil be to grecian children when forced to learn him as i was homer difficulty in truth the difficulty of a foreign tongue dashed as it were with gall all the sweetness of grecian fable for not one word of it did i understand and to make me understand i was urged vehemently with cruel threats and punishments time was also as an infant i knew no latin but this i learned without fear or suffering by mere observation amid the caresses of my nursery and jests of friends smiling and sportively encouraging me this i learned without any pressure of punishment to urge me on for my heart urged me to give birth to its conceptions which i could only do by learning words not of those who taught but of those who talked with me in whose ears also i gave birth to the thoughts whatever i conceived no doubt then that a free curiosity has more force in our learning these things than a frightful enforcement only this enforcement restrains the rovings of that freedom through thy laws o my god thy laws from the master own cane to the martyr own trials being able to temper for us a wholesome bitter recalling us to thyself from that deadly pleasure which lures us from thee,257,1403,2.9500000000000015,-0.1497754785295758,-0.06756756756756743,-0.13730748571891177,-0.04999999999999971,-0.6142793491377997,-0.5000000000000002,-0.5593398323511692,-45.80798819728474,-0.5628309390889188,-0.5151832343790443,-0.4972273908029318,1.4500000000000002,0.00861232732196039,0.10584343048985205,0.04654003356986024,10.986,0.13522313032086547,0.24099693737459074,0.09861208179464413,-19.293750854523626,-1.0348098153190164,-0.9112141006757071,-0.8252756183434959,-1.59318087856254,-0.9213587060484038,-0.9393338064127068,-0.8625557488074374,"{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.7, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.8876}",0.8876,0.1916607416971357,-0.049625353150718705,0.03355738254560161,0.01184210526315788,-0.31110588226281105,-0.865727273577582,-0.6578318847860528,-0.8113,-0.3741893366776205,-0.1272289403566305,-0.15505332750590264,0.0404743515943874,-0.7502958988819051,-0.7124967159486684,-0.7286153080334764,46.9103258687859,-0.1454991576755464,0.24574363712416902,0.003567853778482614

36,36,338,344,350,"This was the world at whose gate unhappy I lay in my boyhood; this the stage where I had feared more to commit a barbarism, than having committed one, to envy those who had not. These things I speak and confess to Thee, my God; for which I had praise from them, whom I then thought it all virtue to please. For I saw not the abyss of vileness, wherein I was cast away from Thine eyes. Before them what more foul than I was already, displeasing even such as myself? with innumerable lies deceiving my tutor, my masters, my parents, from love of play, eagerness to see vain shows and restlessness to imitate them! Thefts also I committed, from my parents' cellar and table, enslaved by greediness, or that I might have to give to boys, who sold me their play, which all the while they liked no less than I. In this play, too, I often sought unfair conquests, conquered myself meanwhile by vain desire of preeminence. And what could I so ill endure, or, when I detected it, upbraided I so fiercely, as that I was doing to others? and for which if, detected, I was upbraided, I chose rather to quarrel than to yield.

For what thief will abide a thief? not even a rich thief, one stealing through want. Yet I lusted to thieve, and did it, compelled by no hunger, nor poverty, but through a cloyedness of well-doing, and a pamperedness of iniquity. For I stole that, of which I had enough, and much better. Nor cared I to enjoy what I stole, but joyed in the theft and sin itself. A pear tree there was near our vineyard, laden with fruit, tempting neither for colour nor taste. To shake and rob this, some lewd young fellows of us went, late one night (having according to our pestilent custom prolonged our sports in the streets till then), and took huge loads, not for our eating, but to fling to the very hogs, having only tasted them. And this, but to do what we liked only, because it was misliked. Behold my heart, O God, behold my heart, which Thou hadst pity upon in the bottom of the bottomless pit.

56,56,509,513,518,"To Carthage I came, where there sang all around me in my ears a cauldron of unholy loves. I loved not yet, yet I loved to love, and out of a deep-seated want, I hated myself for wanting not. I sought what I might love, in love with loving, and safety I hated, and a way without snares. For within me was a famine of that inward food, Thyself, my God; yet, through that famine I was not hungered; but was without all longing for incorruptible sustenance, not because filled therewith, but the more empty, the more I loathed it. For this cause my soul was sickly and full of sores, it miserably cast itself forth, desiring to be scraped by the touch of objects of sense. Yet if these had not a soul, they would not be objects of love. To love then, and to be beloved, was sweet to me; but more, when I obtained to enjoy the person I loved, I defiled, therefore, the spring of friendship with the filth of concupiscence, and I beclouded its brightness with the hell of lustfulness; and thus foul and unseemly, I would fain, through exceeding vanity, be fine and courtly. I fell headlong then into the love wherein I longed to be ensnared. My God, my Mercy, with how much gall didst Thou out of Thy great goodness besprinkle for me that sweetness?

Howsoever, when he suffers in his own person, it uses to be styled misery: when he compassionates others, then it is mercy. But what sort of compassion is this for feigned and scenical passions? for the auditor is not called on to relieve, but only to grieve: and he applauds the actor of these fictions the more, the more he grieves.

58,58,528,538,548,"Are griefs then too loved? Verily all desire joy. Or whereas no man likes to be miserable, is he yet pleased to be merciful? which because it cannot be without passion, for this reason alone are passions loved? This also springs from that vein of friendship. But whither goes that vein? whither flows it? wherefore runs it into that torrent of pitch bubbling forth those monstrous tides of foul lustfulness, into which it is wilfully changed and transformed, being of its own will precipitated and corrupted from its heavenly clearness? Shall compassion then be put away? by no means. Be griefs then sometimes loved. But beware of uncleanness, O my soul, under the guardianship of my God, the God of our fathers, who is to be praised and exalted above all for ever, beware of uncleanness. For I have not now ceased to pity; but then in the theatres I rejoiced with lovers when they wickedly enjoyed one another, although this was imaginary only in the play. And when they lost one another, as if very compassionate, I sorrowed with them, yet had my delight in both. But now I much more pity him that rejoiceth in his wickedness, than him who is thought to suffer hardship, by missing some pernicious pleasure, and the loss of some miserable felicity. This certainly is the truer mercy, but in it grief delights not. For though he that grieves for the miserable, be commended for his office of charity; yet had he, who is genuinely compassionate, rather there were nothing for him to grieve for. For if good will be ill willed (which can never be), then may he, who truly and sincerely commiserates, wish there might be some miserable, that he might commiserate. Some sorrow may then be allowed, none loved. For thus dost Thou, O Lord God, who lovest souls far more purely than we, and hast more incorruptibly pity on them, yet are wounded with no sorrowfulness. And who is sufficient for these things?",are griefs then too loved verily all desire joy or whereas no man likes to be miserable is he yet pleased to be merciful which because it cannot be without passion for this reason alone are passions loved this also springs from that vein of friendship but whither goes that vein whither flows it wherefore runs it into that torrent of pitch bubbling forth those monstrous tides of foul lustfulness into which it is wilfully changed and transformed being of its own will precipitated and corrupted from its heavenly clearness shall compassion then be put away by no means be griefs then sometimes loved but beware of uncleanness o my soul under the guardianship of my god the god of our fathers who is to be praised and exalted above all for ever beware of uncleanness for i have not now ceased to pity but then in the theatres i rejoiced with lovers when they wickedly enjoyed one another although this was imaginary only in the play and when they lost one another as if very compassionate i sorrowed with them yet had my delight in both but now i much more pity him that rejoiceth in his wickedness than him who is thought to suffer hardship by missing some pernicious pleasure and the loss of some miserable felicity this certainly is the truer mercy but in it grief delights not for though he that grieves for the miserable be commended for his office of charity yet had he who is genuinely compassionate rather there were nothing for him to grieve for for if good will be ill willed which can never be then may he who truly and sincerely commiserates wish there might be some miserable that he might commiserate some sorrow may then be allowed none loved for thus dost thou o lord god who lovest souls far more purely than we and hast more incorruptibly pity on them yet are wounded with no sorrowfulness and who is sufficient for these things,334,1901,5.099999999999999,-0.008556144813726019,0.2229729729729727,-0.016563141456499487,5.099999999999999,-0.02503883765370558,0.19594594594594564,-0.046349717107312484,-44.045483760994614,-0.4712787086566764,-0.500494182000014,-0.408383657075351,-3.729166666666667,-1.0995462569361154,-1.2219453685334962,-0.9299516736207136,5.297999999999999,-0.7628975799663826,-0.359700073925441,-0.6443709090871473,37.947925470180785,-0.21503506049300414,0.002647282633681866,-0.16323880825604067,3.045097388369966,0.18740648812271746,0.5125930738007334,0.22092500594833261,"{'neg': 0.182, 'neu': 0.563, 'pos': 0.255, 'compound': 0.9876}",0.9876,0.09481712070812598,0.07320967940056503,-0.10393508093153118,0.10761904761904759,-0.2238576081098215,-0.35935371127302895,-0.3592340390896885,0.7204,0.23707340454368922,0.6576142652182824,0.5303250509600524,0.6748799648232734,-0.11498141074337746,0.3554277781705765,0.006361566995589862,56.165129607712714,-0.638341608954521,0.8188549204295246,-0.7914527179390293

65,65,581,589,597,"Therefore I fell among men proudly doting, exceeding carnal and prating, in whose mouths were the snares of the Devil, limed with the mixture of the syllables of Thy name, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, our Comforter. These names departed not out of their mouth, but so far forth as the sound only and the noise of the tongue, for the heart was void of truth. Yet they cried out ""Truth, Truth,"" and spake much thereof to me, yet it was not in them: but they spake falsehood, not of Thee only (who truly art Truth), but even of those elements of this world, Thy creatures. And I indeed ought to have passed by even philosophers who spake truth concerning them, for love of Thee, my Father, supremely good, Beauty of all things beautiful. O Truth, Truth, how inwardly did even then the marrow of my soul pant after Thee, when they often and diversely, and in many and huge books, echoed of Thee to me, though it was but an echo? And these were the dishes wherein to me, hungering after Thee, they, instead of Thee, served up the Sun and Moon, beautiful works of Thine, but yet Thy works, not Thyself, no nor Thy first works. For Thy spiritual works are before these corporeal works, celestial though they be, and shining. But I hungered and thirsted not even after those first works of Thine, but after Thee Thyself, the Truth, in whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning: yet they still set before me in those dishes, glittering fantasies, than which better were it to love this very sun (which is real to our sight at least), than those fantasies which by our eyes deceive our mind. Yet because I thought them to be Thee, I fed thereon; not eagerly, for Thou didst not in them taste to me as Thou art; for Thou wast not these emptinesses, nor was I nourished by them, but exhausted rather. Food in sleep shows very like our food awake; yet are not those asleep nourished by it, for they are asleep. But those were not even any way like to Thee, as Thou hast now spoken to me; for those were corporeal fantasies, false bodies, than which these true bodies, celestial or terrestrial, which with our fleshly sight we behold, are far more certain: these things the beasts and birds discern as well as we, and they are more certain than when we fancy them. And again, we do with more certainty fancy them, than by them conjecture other vaster and infinite bodies which have no being. Such empty husks was I then fed on; and was not fed. But Thou, my soul's Love, in looking for whom I fail, that I may become strong, art neither those bodies which we see, though in heaven; nor those which we see not there; for Thou hast created them, nor dost Thou account them among the chiefest of Thy works. How far then art Thou from those fantasies of mine, fantasies of bodies which altogether are not, than which the images of those bodies, which are, are far more certain, and more certain still the bodies themselves, which yet Thou art not; no, nor yet the soul, which is the life of the bodies. So then, better and more certain is the life of the bodies than the bodies. But Thou art the life of souls, the life of lives, having life in Thyself; and changest not, life of my soul.",therefore i fell among men proudly doting exceeding carnal and prating in whose mouths were the snares of the devil limed with the mixture of the syllables of thy name and of our lord jesus christ and of the holy ghost the paraclete our comforter these names departed not out of their mouth but so far forth as the sound only and the noise of the tongue for the heart was void of truth yet they cried out truth truth and spake much thereof to me yet it was not in them but they spake falsehood not of thee only who truly art truth but even of those elements of this world thy creatures and i indeed ought to have passed by even philosophers who spake truth concerning them for love of thee my father supremely good beauty of all things beautiful o truth truth how inwardly did even then the marrow of my soul pant after thee when they often and diversely and in many and huge books echoed of thee to me though it was but an echo and these were the dishes wherein to me hungering after thee they instead of thee served up the sun and moon beautiful works of thine but yet thy works not thyself no nor thy first works for thy spiritual works are before these corporeal works celestial though they be and shining but i hungered and thirsted not even after those first works of thine but after thee thyself the truth in whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning yet they still set before me in those dishes glittering fantasies than which better were it to love this very sun which is real to our sight at least than those fantasies which by our eyes deceive our mind yet because i thought them to be thee i fed thereon not eagerly for thou didst not in them taste to me as thou art for thou wast not these emptinesses nor was i nourished by them but exhausted rather food in sleep shows very like our food awake yet are not those asleep nourished by it for they are asleep but those were not even any way like to thee as thou hast now spoken to me for those were corporeal fantasies false bodies than which these true bodies celestial or terrestrial which with our fleshly sight we behold are far more certain these things the beasts and birds discern as well as we and they are more certain than when we fancy them and again we do with more certainty fancy them than by them conjecture other vaster and infinite bodies which have no being such empty husks was i then fed on and was not fed but thou my soul own love in looking for whom i fail that i may become strong art neither those bodies which we see though in heaven nor those which we see not there for thou hast created them nor dost thou account them among the chiefest of thy works how far then art thou from those fantasies of mine fantasies of bodies which altogether are not than which the images of those bodies which are are far more certain and more certain still the bodies themselves which yet thou art not no nor yet the soul which is the life of the bodies so then better and more certain is the life of the bodies than the bodies but thou art the life of souls the life of lives having life in thyself and changest not life of my soul,598,3218,24.300000000000008,0.93639210262684,2.8175675675675684,0.7913797477848844,30.05000000000001,1.3078908820360453,3.567567567567569,1.1140928478368406,270.50455814467904,0.6822368438844306,2.1210266188804114,0.7110060958202131,7.399647619047621,0.4524752374665462,1.6311613001678629,0.43766496554505036,22.785000000000004,-0.01995143327012705,1.4870630478403213,-0.02975825867856267,182.99834642859074,0.620863499451075,2.3183722379046556,0.5118193256084591,4.311944047746634,0.0493955031106244,0.9091558956070321,0.08606124309611253,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.9989}",0.9989,-0.15595840159230948,0.08709003807886004,-0.4599703467418053,0.26233535967578514,-0.18705576521699271,0.45863283283358963,-0.23328368520434253,-0.9764,-0.19887164417920197,-0.21182619389219107,0.04152164377548139,1.925445016478478,0.29394478199457985,2.4605621311830808,0.47943639980271385,95.01676705213119,-0.9561775167308932,3.2247743134718956,-1.3041644059378628

Therefore are those foul offences which be against nature, to be every where and at all times detested and punished; such as were those of the men of Sodom: which should all nations commit, they should all stand guilty of the same crime, by the law of God, which hath not so made men that they should so abuse one another. For even that intercourse which should be between God and us is violated, when that same nature, of which He is Author, is polluted by perversity of lust. But those actions which are offences against the customs of men, are to be avoided according to the customs severally prevailing; so that a thing agreed upon, and confirmed, by custom or law of any city or nation, may not be violated at the lawless pleasure of any, whether native or foreigner. For any part which harmoniseth not with its whole, is offensive. But when God commands a thing to be done, against the customs or compact of any people, though it were never by them done heretofore, it is to be done; and if intermitted, it is to be restored; and if never ordained, is now to be ordained. For lawful if it be for a king, in the state which he reigns over, to command that which no one before him, nor he himself heretofore, had commanded, and to obey him cannot be against the common weal of the state (nay, it were against it if he were not obeyed, for to obey princes is a general compact of human society); how much more unhesitatingly ought we to obey God, in all which He commands, the Ruler of all His creatures!

But what foul offences can there be against Thee, who canst not be defiled? or what acts of violence against Thee, who canst not be harmed?

Whom when this woman had entreated to vouchsafe to converse with me, refute my errors, unteach me ill things, and teach me good things (for this he was wont to do, when he found persons fitted to receive it), he refused, wisely, as I afterwards perceived. For he answered, that I was yet unteachable, being puffed up with the novelty of that heresy, and had already perplexed divers unskilful persons with captious questions, as she had told him: ""but let him alone a while"" (saith he), ""only pray God for him, he will of himself by reading find what that error is, and how great its impiety.""

May I learn from Thee, who art Truth, and approach the ear of my heart unto Thy mouth, that Thou mayest tell me why weeping is sweet to the miserable? Hast Thou, although present every where, cast away our misery far from Thee? And Thou abidest in Thyself, but we are tossed about in divers trials. And yet unless we mourned in Thine ears, we should have no hope left. Whence then is sweet fruit gathered from the bitterness of life, from groaning, tears, sighs, and complaints? Doth this sweeten it, that we hope Thou hearest? This is true of prayer, for therein is a longing to approach unto Thee.

87,87,731,737,743,"But what speak I of these things? for now is no time to question, but to confess unto Thee. Wretched I was; and wretched is every soul bound by the friendship of perishable things; he is torn asunder when he loses them, and then he feels the wretchedness which he had ere yet he lost them. So was it then with me; I wept most bitterly, and found my repose in bitterness. Thus was I wretched, and that wretched life I held dearer than my friend. For though I would willingly have changed it, yet was I more unwilling to part with it than with him; yea, I know not whether I would have parted with it even for him, as is related (if not feigned) of Pylades and Orestes, that they would gladly have died for each other or together, not to live together being to them worse than death. But in me there had arisen some unexplained feeling, too contrary to this, for at once I loathed exceedingly to live and feared to die. I suppose, the more I loved him, the more did I hate, and fear (as a most cruel enemy) death, which had bereaved me of him: and I imagined it would speedily make an end of all men, since it had power over him. Thus was it with me, I remember. Behold my heart, O my God, behold and see into me; for well I remember it, O my Hope, who cleansest me from the impurity of such affections, directing mine eyes towards Thee, and plucking my feet out of the snare. For I wondered that others, subject to death, did live, since he whom I loved, as if he should never die, was dead; and I wondered yet more that myself, who was to him a second self, could live, he being dead. Well said one of his friend, ""Thou half of my soul""; for I felt that my soul and his soul were ""one soul in two bodies"": and therefore was my life a horror to me, because I would not live halved. And therefore perchance I feared to die, lest he whom I had much loved should die wholly.",but what speak i of these things for now is no time to question but to confess unto thee wretched i was and wretched is every soul bound by the friendship of perishable things he is torn asunder when he loses them and then he feels the wretchedness which he had ere yet he lost them so was it then with me i wept most bitterly and found my repose in bitterness thus was i wretched and that wretched life i held dearer than my friend for though i would willingly have changed it yet was i more unwilling to part with it than with him yea i know not whether i would have parted with it even for him as is related if not feigned of pylades and orestes that they would gladly have died for each other or together not to live together being to them worse than death but in me there had arisen some unexplained feeling too contrary to this for at once i loathed exceedingly to live and feared to die i suppose the more i loved him the more did i hate and fear as a most cruel enemy death which had bereaved me of him and i imagined it would speedily make an end of all men since it had power over him thus was it with me i remember behold my heart o my god behold and see into me for well i remember it o my hope who cleansest me from the impurity of such affections directing mine eyes towards thee and plucking my feet out of the snare for i wondered that others subject to death did live since he whom i loved as if he should never die was dead and i wondered yet more that myself who was to him a second self could live he being dead well said one of his friend thou half of my soul for i felt that my soul and his soul were one soul in two bodies and therefore was my life a horror to me because i would not live halved and therefore perchance i feared to die lest he whom i had much loved should die wholly,368,1870,-17.099999999999998,-2.3084123490704584,-2.7770270270270263,-1.9829697373095472,-17.099999999999998,-2.377458810859757,-2.8040540540540544,-2.094355870176267,-303.9917179333446,-1.8419249821849095,-2.666936303148108,-1.7384804989012597,-3.9597999999999987,-1.0728534664555445,-1.2810730962917745,-0.9064304114870058,3.8380000000000005,-0.9443913489002409,-0.5138874221142675,-0.7945141823958749,-132.00836380865113,-2.2671271906788033,-2.710698999216076,-1.8204751647990232,-5.991927936163217,-1.6513028072237321,-2.316279889557902,-1.575854100729645,"{'neg': 0.237, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': -0.9954}",-0.9954,-1.0088376746332184,-2.362609016091389,-1.6708345327503855,0.09396464646464645,-0.2449873174752936,-0.4315446539322495,-0.43154819954697105,-0.9935,-0.32160886250252835,-0.2205882352941177,-0.09609746826754578,0.5446839596814103,-0.299282991408446,0.1362627833657355,-0.20685157759524078,59.75283691896097,-0.8368050265885536,1.0410266270671338,-1.1116006665237321

All things looked ghastly, yea, the very light; whatsoever was not what he was, was revolting and hateful, except groaning and tears. For in those alone found I a little refreshment. But when my soul was withdrawn from them a huge load of misery weighed me down. To Thee, O Lord, it ought to have been raised, for Thee to lighten; I knew it; but neither could nor would; the more, since, when I thought of Thee, Thou wert not to me any solid or substantial thing. For Thou wert not Thyself, but a mere phantom, and my error was my God. If I offered to discharge my load thereon, that it might rest, it glided through the void, and came rushing down again on me; and I had remained to myself a hapless spot, where I could neither be, nor be from thence. For whither should my heart flee from my heart? Whither should I flee from myself? Whither not follow myself?

For whence had that former grief so easily reached my very inmost soul, but that I had poured out my soul upon the dust, in loving one that must die, as if he would never die? For what restored and refreshed me chiefly was the solaces of other friends, with whom I did love, what instead of Thee I loved; and this was a great fable, and protracted lie, by whose adulterous stimulus, our soul, which lay itching in our ears, was being defiled. But that fable would not die to me, so oft as any of my friends died. There were other things which in them did more take my mind; to talk and jest together, to do kind offices by turns; to read together honied books; to play the fool or be earnest together; to dissent at times without discontent, as a man might with his own self; and even with the seldomness of these dissentings, to season our more frequent consentings; sometimes to teach, and sometimes learn; long for the absent with impatience; and welcome the coming with joy.

91,91,777,784,791,"Turn us, O God of Hosts, show us Thy countenance, and we shall be whole. For whithersoever the soul of man turns itself, unless toward Thee, it is riveted upon sorrows, yea though it is riveted on things beautiful. And yet they, out of Thee, and out of the soul, were not, unless they were from Thee. They rise, and set; and by rising, they begin as it were to be; they grow, that they may be perfected; and perfected, they wax old and wither; and all grow not old, but all wither. So then when they rise and tend to be, the more quickly they grow that they may be, so much the more they haste not to be. This is the law of them. Thus much has Thou allotted them, because they are portions of things, which exist not all at once, but by passing away and succeeding, they together complete that universe, whereof they are portions. And even thus is our speech completed by signs giving forth a sound: but this again is not perfected unless one word pass away when it hath sounded its part, that another may succeed. Out of all these things let my soul praise Thee, O God, Creator of all; yet let not my soul be riveted unto these things with the glue of love, through the senses of the body. For they go whither they were to go, that they might not be; and they rend her with pestilent longings, because she longs to be, yet loves to repose in what she loves. But in these things is no place of repose; they abide not, they flee; and who can follow them with the senses of the flesh? yea, who can grasp them, when they are hard by?

For the rest of the sect, whom by chance I had lighted upon, when unable to solve my objections about these things, still held out to me the coming of this Faustus, by conference with whom these and greater difficulties, if I had them, were to be most readily and abundantly cleared. When then he came, I found him a man of pleasing discourse, and who could speak fluently and in better terms, yet still but the self-same things which they were wont to say. But what availed the utmost neatness of the cup-bearer to my thirst for a more precious draught? Mine ears were already cloyed with the like, nor did they seem to me therefore better, because better said; nor therefore true, because eloquent; nor the soul therefore wise, because the face was comely, and the language graceful. But they who held him out to me were no good judges of things; and therefore to them he appeared understanding and wise, because in words pleasing. I felt however that another sort of people were suspicious even of truth, and refused to assent to it, if delivered in a smooth and copious discourse. But Thou, O my God, hadst already taught me by wonderful and secret ways, and therefore I believe that Thou taughtest me, because it is truth, nor is there besides Thee any teacher of truth, where or whencesoever it may shine upon us. Of Thyself therefore had I now learned, that neither ought any thing to seem to be spoken truly, because eloquently; nor therefore falsely, because the utterance of the lips is inharmonious; nor, again, therefore true, because rudely delivered; nor therefore false, because the language is rich; but that wisdom and folly are as wholesome and unwholesome food; and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country vessels; either kind of meats may be served up in either kind of dishes.",and for almost all those nine years wherein with unsettled mind i had been their disciple i had longed but too intensely for the coming of this faustus for the rest of the sect whom by chance i had lighted upon when unable to solve my objections about these things still held out to me the coming of this faustus by conference with whom these and greater difficulties if i had them were to be most readily and abundantly cleared when then he came i found him a man of pleasing discourse and who could speak fluently and in better terms yet still but the self same things which they were will not to say but what availed the utmost neatness of the cup bearer to my thirst for a more precious draught mine ears were already cloyed with the like nor did they seem to me therefore better because better said nor therefore true because eloquent nor the soul therefore wise because the face was comely and the language graceful but they who held him out to me were no good judges of things and therefore to them he appeared understanding and wise because in words pleasing i felt however that another sort of people were suspicious even of truth and refused to assent to it if delivered in a smooth and copious discourse but thou o my god hadst already taught me by wonderful and secret ways and therefore i believe that thou taughtest me because it is truth nor is there besides thee any teacher of truth where or whencesoever it may shine upon us of thyself therefore had i now learned that neither ought any thing to seem to be spoken truly because eloquently nor therefore falsely because the utterance of the lips is inharmonious nor again therefore true because rudely delivered nor therefore false because the language is rich but that wisdom and folly are as wholesome and unwholesome food and adorned or unadorned phrases as courtly or country vessels either kind of meats may be served up in either kind of dishes,348,1963,17.900000000000002,1.338769371563956,1.9527027027027024,1.1354174811852613,18.9,1.4625743327741347,2.0608108108108105,1.2487595580747228,204.31386902712745,0.9483137237063686,1.5693806318221555,0.969211312125251,6.900297619047619,0.9439738107816801,1.5031423775370059,0.8707656857452684,21.723,0.7925023032084715,1.374907593198859,0.642355523096821,94.62407522953492,0.4726743899478323,0.9074800538811603,0.39214420171903236,4.200125934047062,0.40112610099353113,0.8741533115377194,0.42977092632599034,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.727, 'pos': 0.216, 'compound': 0.997}",0.997,0.07689446240502643,0.08475617246038564,-0.12938054049805955,0.27788461538461534,-0.07336245464558865,0.5408418886959849,0.15581945679225695,0.5244,0.16230162545550847,0.5571838491494159,0.44648719000343673,1.4115854968418537,0.5791790365244587,1.5955584866483137,0.8094156226280312,62.16186382389651,-0.27939421129837455,1.1902075864858186,-0.21242271644354538

And how I was persuaded to this, I will not neglect to confess to Thee; because herein also the deepest recesses of Thy wisdom, and Thy most present mercy to us, must be considered and confessed. I did not wish therefore to go to Rome, because higher gains and higher dignities were warranted me by my friends who persuaded me to this (though even these things had at that time an influence over my mind), but my chief and almost only reason was, that I heard that young men studied there more peacefully, and were kept quiet under a restraint of more regular discipline; so that they did not, at their pleasures, petulantly rush into the school of one whose pupils they were not, nor were even admitted without his permission. Whereas at Carthage there reigns among the scholars a most disgraceful and unruly licence. They burst in audaciously, and with gestures almost frantic, disturb all order which any one hath established for the good of his scholars. Divers outrages they commit, with a wonderful stolidity, punishable by law, did not custom uphold them; that custom evincing them to be the more miserable, in that they now do as lawful what by Thy eternal law shall never be lawful; and they think they do it unpunished, whereas they are punished with the very blindness whereby they do it, and suffer incomparably worse than what they do. The manners then which, when a student, I would not make my own, I was fain as a teacher to endure in others: and so I was well pleased to go where, all that knew it, assured me that the like was not done. But Thou, my refuge and my portion in the land of the living; that I might change my earthly dwelling for the salvation of my soul, at Carthage didst goad me, that I might thereby be torn from it; and at Rome didst proffer me allurements, whereby I might be drawn thither, by men in love with a dying life, the one doing frantic, the other promising vain, things; and, to correct my steps, didst secretly use their and my own perverseness. For both they who disturbed my quiet were blinded with a disgraceful frenzy, and they who invited me elsewhere savoured of earth.

But I deceived her, holding me by force, that either she might keep me back or go with me, and I feigned that I had a friend whom I could not leave, till he had a fair wind to sail. And I lied to my mother, and such a mother, and escaped: for this also hast Thou mercifully forgiven me, preserving me, thus full of execrable defilements, from the waters of the sea, for the water of Thy Grace; whereby when I was cleansed, the streams of my mother's eyes should be dried, with which for me she daily watered the ground under her face. And yet refusing to return without me, I scarcely persuaded her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship, where was an Oratory in memory of the blessed Cyprian. That night I privily departed, but she was not behind in weeping and prayer. And what, O Lord, was she with so many tears asking of Thee, but that Thou wouldest not suffer me to sail? But Thou, in the depth of Thy counsels and hearing the main point of her desire, regardest not what she then asked, that Thou mightest make me what she ever asked. The wind blew and swelled our sails, and withdrew the shore from our sight; and she on the morrow was there, frantic with sorrow, and with complaints and groans filled Thine ears, Who didst then disregard them; whilst through my desires, Thou wert hurrying me to end all desire, and the earthly part of her affection to me was chastened by the allotted scourge of sorrows. For she loved my being with her, as mothers do, but much more than many; and she knew not how great joy Thou wert about to work for her out of my absence. She knew not; therefore did she weep and wail, and by this agony there appeared in her the inheritance of Eve, with sorrow seeking what in sorrow she had brought forth. And yet, after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness, she betook herself again to intercede to Thee for me, went to her wonted place, and I to Rome.",but why i went hence and went thither thou knewest o god yet showedst it neither to me nor to my mother who grievously bewailed my journey and followed me as far as the sea but i deceived her holding me by force that either she might keep me back or go with me and i feigned that i had a friend whom i could not leave till he had a fair wind to sail and i lied to my mother and such a mother and escaped for this also hast thou mercifully forgiven me preserving me thus full of execrable defilements from the waters of the sea for the water of thy grace whereby when i was cleansed the streams of my mother own eyes should be dried with which for me she daily watered the ground under her face and yet refusing to return without me i scarcely persuaded her to stay that night in a place hard by our ship where was an oratory in memory of the blessed cyprian that night i privily departed but she was not behind in weeping and prayer and what o lord was she with so many tears asking of thee but that thou wouldest not suffer me to sail but thou in the depth of thy counsels and hearing the main point of her desire regardest not what she then asked that thou mightest make me what she ever asked the wind blew and swelled our sails and withdrew the shore from our sight and she on the morrow was there frantic with sorrow and with complaints and groans filled thine ears who didst then disregard them whilst through my desires thou wert hurrying me to end all desire and the earthly part of her affection to me was chastened by the allotted scourge of sorrows for she loved my being with her as mothers do but much more than many and she knew not how great joy thou wert about to work for her out of my absence she knew not therefore did she weep and wail and by this agony there appeared in her the inheritance of eve with sorrow seeking what in sorrow she had brought forth and yet after accusing my treachery and hardheartedness she betook herself again to intercede to thee for me went to her wonted place and i to rome,397,2080,-8.350000000000001,-1.3609065160450753,-1.5945945945945947,-1.1728400795414464,-9.350000000000001,-1.504277309231236,-1.7567567567567575,-1.3341680174757993,-171.82287348731722,-1.0654506704783122,-1.565415626678154,-0.9849775348568915,-5.9,-1.3432560143259122,-1.7784843583091716,-1.1447048329908538,0.5000000000000006,-1.2507234385205632,-0.8664061674939275,-1.0479317125142735,-31.281405982838645,-1.0509781889308587,-1.1025966003085814,-0.838332934914019,-2.13677451574684,-0.8622260441185297,-1.109495700184304,-0.8047715565227996,"{'neg': 0.142, 'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': -0.9611}",-0.9611,-0.9534803496326119,-2.320476599926299,-1.5922416950589755,0.250625,-0.12619834601753405,0.3967200550915231,-0.025005705565059776,-0.9903,-0.297995580017355,-0.2189485550317688,-0.06962107412709685,0.7695276999960347,-0.14302557427588788,0.5147527157124455,-0.026081911094011465,66.07564271770997,-0.6973838650448452,1.4325715422953176,-0.8866957475737695

For Thou hadst not forgiven me any of these things in Christ, nor had He abolished by His Cross the enmity which by my sins I had incurred with Thee. For how should He, by the crucifixion of a phantasm, which I believed Him to be? So true, then, was the death of my soul, as that of His flesh seemed to me false; and how true the death of His body, so false was the life of my soul, which did not believe it. And now the fever heightening, I was parting and departing for ever. For had I then parted hence, whither had I departed, but into fire and torments, such as my misdeeds deserved in the truth of Thy appointment? And this she knew not, yet in absence prayed for me. But Thou, everywhere present, heardest her where she was, and, where I was, hadst compassion upon me; that I should recover the health of my body, though frenzied as yet in my sacrilegious heart. For I did not in all that danger desire Thy baptism; and I was better as a boy, when I begged it of my mother's piety, as I have before recited and confessed. But I had grown up to my own shame, and I madly scoffed at the prescripts of Thy medicine, who wouldest not suffer me, being such, to die a double death. With which wound had my mother's heart been pierced, it could never be healed.

And even then, at Rome, I joined myself to those deceiving and deceived ""holy ones""; not with their disciples only (of which number was he, in whose house I had fallen sick and recovered); but also with those whom they call ""The Elect.""

And it seemed to me better to believe Thee to have created no evil (which to me ignorant seemed not some only, but a bodily substance, because I could not conceive of mind unless as a subtile body, and that diffused in definite spaces), than to believe the nature of evil, such as I conceived it, could come from Thee. Yea, and our Saviour Himself, Thy Only Begotten, I believed to have been reached forth (as it were) for our salvation, out of the mass of Thy most lucid substance, so as to believe nothing of Him, but what I could imagine in my vanity. His Nature then, being such, I thought could not be born of the Virgin Mary, without being mingled with the flesh: and how that which I had so figured to myself could be mingled, and not defiled, I saw not.

To Milan I came, to Ambrose the Bishop, known to the whole world as among the best of men, Thy devout servant; whose eloquent discourse did then plentifully dispense unto Thy people the flour of Thy wheat, the gladness of Thy oil, and the sober inebriation of Thy wine. To him was I unknowing led by Thee, that by him I might knowingly be led to Thee. That man of God received me as a father, and showed me an Episcopal kindness on my coming. Thenceforth I began to love him, at first indeed not as a teacher of the truth (which I utterly despaired of in Thy Church), but as a person kind towards myself. And I listened diligently to him preaching to the people, not with that intent I ought, but, as it were, trying his eloquence, whether it answered the fame thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than was reported; and I hung on his words attentively; but of the matter I was as a careless and scornful looker-on; and I was delighted with the sweetness of his discourse, more recondite, yet in manner less winning and harmonious, than that of Faustus.

Hadst not Thou created me, and separated me from the beasts of the field, and fowls of the air? Thou hadst made me wiser, yet did I walk in darkness, and in slippery places, and sought Thee abroad out of myself, and found not the God of my heart; and had come into the depths of the sea, and distrusted and despaired of ever finding truth. My mother had now come to me, resolute through piety, following me over sea and land, in all perils confiding in Thee. For in perils of the sea, she comforted the very mariners (by whom passengers unacquainted with the deep, use rather to be comforted when troubled), assuring them of a safe arrival, because Thou hadst by a vision assured her thereof. She found me in grievous peril, through despair of ever finding truth. But when I had discovered to her that I was now no longer a Manichee, though not yet a Catholic Christian, she was not overjoyed, as at something unexpected; although she was now assured concerning that part of my misery, for which she bewailed me as one dead, though to be reawakened by Thee, carrying me forth upon the bier of her thoughts, that Thou mightest say to the son of the widow, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise; and he should revive, and begin to speak, and Thou shouldest deliver him to his mother. Her heart then was shaken with no tumultuous exultation, when she heard that what she daily with tears desired of Thee was already in so great part realised; in that, though I had not yet attained the truth, I was rescued from falsehood; but, as being assured, that Thou, Who hadst promised the whole, wouldest one day give the rest, most calmly, and with a heart full of confidence, she replied to me, ""She believed in Christ, that before she departed this life, she should see me a Catholic believer."" Thus much to me. But to Thee, Fountain of mercies, poured she forth more copious prayers and tears, that Thou wouldest hasten Thy help, and enlighten my darkness; and she hastened the more eagerly to the Church, and hung upon the lips of Ambrose, praying for the fountain of that water, which springeth up unto life everlasting. But that man she loved as an angel of God, because she knew that by him I had been brought for the present to that doubtful state of faith I now was in, through which she anticipated most confidently that I should pass from sickness unto health, after the access, as it were, of a sharper fit, which physicians call ""the crisis.""",o thou my hope from my youth where wert thou to me and whither wert thou gone hadst not thou created me and separated me from the beasts of the field and fowls of the air thou hadst made me wiser yet did i walk in darkness and in slippery places and sought thee abroad out of myself and found not the god of my heart and had come into the depths of the sea and distrusted and despaired of ever finding truth my mother had now come to me resolute through piety following me over sea and land in all perils confiding in thee for in perils of the sea she comforted the very mariners by whom passengers unacquainted with the deep use rather to be comforted when troubled assuring them of a safe arrival because thou hadst by a vision assured her thereof she found me in grievous peril through despair of ever finding truth but when i had discovered to her that i was now no longer a manichee though not yet a catholic christian she was not overjoyed as at something unexpected although she was now assured concerning that part of my misery for which she bewailed me as one dead though to be reawakened by thee carrying me forth upon the bier of her thoughts that thou mightest say to the son of the widow young man i say unto thee arise and he should revive and begin to speak and thou shouldest deliver him to his mother her heart then was shaken with no tumultuous exultation when she heard that what she daily with tears desired of thee was already in so great part realised in that though i had not yet attained the truth i was rescued from falsehood but as being assured that thou who hadst promised the whole wouldest one day give the rest most calmly and with a heart full of confidence she replied to me she believed in christ that before she departed this life she should see me a catholic believer thus much to me but to thee fountain of mercies poured she forth more copious prayers and tears that thou wouldest hasten thy help and enlighten my darkness and she hastened the more eagerly to the church and hung upon the lips of ambrose praying for the fountain of that water which springeth up unto life everlasting but that man she loved as an angel of god because she knew that by him i had been brought for the present to that doubtful state of faith i now was in through which she anticipated most confidently that i should pass from sickness unto health after the access as it were of a sharper fit which physicians call the crisis,462,2522,10.049999999999999,0.23298151279686036,0.8918918918918914,0.18995465830561656,9.049999999999999,0.13954306778713976,0.7297297297297295,0.09693454287424488,28.02861484028637,-0.09111688816259343,0.10018527600694042,-0.039468608322218254,1.9916666666666658,-0.07914900945529967,0.24471112467572087,-0.030793859604219598,21.903000000000006,0.2909634012548468,1.393916992290633,0.2274504116247863,105.3573278329787,0.2821124354577219,1.0788360605772636,0.2382494547388826,1.6037039425733908,-0.2213049267578173,0.06139162178013704,-0.1784660956122708,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.734, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9892}",0.9892,-0.06419975841617732,0.07517503992138548,-0.32969721396584944,0.15000000000000002,-0.22307951539415746,-0.13528523191754024,-0.35657110035646034,0.9973,0.2372772219748106,0.7994978479196556,0.5305535812646576,0.659011835653585,-0.31759004520639617,0.3287162178331613,-0.2280304763022896,76.3363076664934,-0.7387856518444285,2.067971602874609,-0.953482348699774
135,135,1082,1084,1087,"When then my mother had once, as she was wont in Afric, brought to the Churches built in memory of the Saints, certain cakes, and bread and wine, and was forbidden by the door-keeper; so soon as she knew that the Bishop had forbidden this, she so piously and obediently embraced his wishes, that I myself wondered how readily she censured her own practice, rather than discuss his prohibition. For wine-bibbing did not lay siege to her spirit, nor did love of wine provoke her to hatred of the truth, as it doth too many (both men and women), who revolt at a lesson of sobriety, as men well-drunk at a draught mingled with water. But she, when she had brought her basket with the accustomed festival-food, to be but tasted by herself, and then given away, never joined therewith more than one small cup of wine, diluted according to her own abstemious habits, which for courtesy she would taste. And if there were many churches of the departed saints that were to be honoured in that manner, she still carried round that same one cup, to be used every where; and this, though not only made very watery, but unpleasantly heated with carrying about, she would distribute to those about her by small sips; for she sought there devotion, not pleasure. So soon, then, as she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous preacher and most pious prelate, even to those that would use it soberly, lest so an occasion of excess might be given to the drunken; and for these, as it were, anniversary funeral solemnities did much resemble the superstition of the Gentiles, she most willingly forbare it: and for a basket filled with fruits of the earth, she had learned to bring to the Churches of the martyrs a breast filled with more purified petitions, and to give what she could to the poor; that so the communication of the Lord's Body might be there rightly celebrated, where, after the example of His Passion, the martyrs had been sacrificed and crowned. But yet it seems to me, O Lord my God, and thus thinks my heart of it in Thy sight, that perhaps she would not so readily have yielded to the cutting off of this custom, had it been forbidden by another, whom she loved not as Ambrose, whom, for my salvation, she loved most entirely; and he her again, for her most religious conversation, whereby in good works, so fervent in spirit, she was constant at church; so that, when he saw me, he often burst forth into her praises; congratulating me that I had such a mother; not knowing what a son she had in me, who doubted of all these things, and imagined the way to life could not be found out.",when then my mother had once as she was will not in afric brought to the churches built in memory of the saints certain cakes and bread and wine and was forbidden by the door keeper so soon as she knew that the bishop had forbidden this she so piously and obediently embraced his wishes that i myself wondered how readily she censured her own practice rather than discuss his prohibition for wine bibbing did not lay siege to her spirit nor did love of wine provoke her to hatred of the truth as it doth too many both men and women who revolt at a lesson of sobriety as men well drunk at a draught mingled with water but she when she had brought her basket with the accustomed festival food to be but tasted by herself and then given away never joined therewith more than one small cup of wine diluted according to her own abstemious habits which for courtesy she would taste and if there were many churches of the departed saints that were to be honoured in that manner she still carried round that same one cup to be used every where and this though not only made very watery but unpleasantly heated with carrying about she would distribute to those about her by small sips for she sought there devotion not pleasure so soon then as she found this custom to be forbidden by that famous preacher and most pious prelate even to those that would use it soberly lest so an occasion of excess might be given to the drunken and for these as it were anniversary funeral solemnities did much resemble the superstition of the gentiles she most willingly forbare it and for a basket filled with fruits of the earth she had learned to bring to the churches of the martyrs a breast filled with more purified petitions and to give what she could to the poor that so the communication of the lord own body might be there rightly celebrated where after the example of his passion the martyrs had been sacrificed and crowned but yet it seems to me o lord my god and thus thinks my heart of it in thy sight that perhaps she would not so readily have yielded to the cutting off of this custom had it been forbidden by another whom she loved not as ambrose whom for my salvation she loved most entirely and he her again for her most religious conversation whereby in good works so fervent in spirit she was constant at church so that when he saw me he often burst forth into her praises congratulating me that i had such a mother not knowing what a son she had in me who doubted of all these things and imagined the way to life could not be found out,478,2597,9.099999999999998,0.13181882110532345,0.7635135135135129,0.1034592574939055,9.899999999999999,0.18231678848457675,0.8445945945945943,0.13417315000042693,27.895517268968874,-0.09567623619651645,0.09907601514135098,-0.04389307183102395,1.9047071428571432,-0.10065811821574643,0.22241721349000468,-0.04974734390872321,17.92600000000001,-0.039992335041911596,0.9739148801351787,-0.046337376571976306,105.13549324870232,0.24693256894372886,1.0752944791095458,0.20983876452292255,3.189990711281732,0.01052205945175575,0.5579492379185385,0.04807427498339728,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.98}",0.98,-0.08192215209051623,0.06387421692666741,-0.3548583504466192,0.21343537414965988,-0.18458189306393438,0.2000981661546796,-0.22481712351469635,-0.9999,-0.25168034923805166,-0.22386759581881535,-0.01769011935244192,1.4968580385435772,0.26383289114060693,1.739101724696903,0.4446008280437339,77.1977752130179,-0.8666476863851021,2.1213186845677567,-1.159740854917514

And Ambrose himself, as the world counts happy, I esteemed a happy man, whom personages so great held in such honour; only his celibacy seemed to me a painful course. But what hope he bore within him, what struggles he had against the temptations which beset his very excellencies, or what comfort in adversities, and what sweet joys Thy Bread had for the hidden mouth of his spirit, when chewing the cud thereof, I neither could conjecture, nor had experienced. Nor did he know the tides of my feelings, or the abyss of my danger. For I could not ask of him, what I would as I would, being shut out both from his ear and speech by multitudes of busy people, whose weaknesses he served. With whom when he was not taken up (which was but a little time), he was either refreshing his body with the sustenance absolutely necessary, or his mind with reading. But when he was reading, his eye glided over the pages, and his heart searched out the sense, but his voice and tongue were at rest. Ofttimes when we had come (for no man was forbidden to enter, nor was it his wont that any who came should be announced to him), we saw him thus reading to himself, and never otherwise; and having long sat silent (for who durst intrude on one so intent?) we were fain to depart, conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained, free from the din of others' business, for the recruiting of his mind, he was loth to be taken off; and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he read should deliver any thing obscurely, some attentive or perplexed hearer should desire him to expound it, or to discuss some of the harder questions; so that his time being thus spent, he could not turn over so many volumes as he desired; although the preserving of his voice (which a very little speaking would weaken) might be the truer reason for his reading to himself.

Behold my heart, O Lord, who wouldest I should remember all this, and confess to Thee. Let my soul cleave unto Thee, now that Thou hast freed it from that fast-holding birdlime of death. How wretched was it! and Thou didst irritate the feeling of its wound, that forsaking all else, it might be converted unto Thee, who art above all, and without whom all things would be nothing; be converted, and be healed.

For, passing through one of the streets of Milan, I observed a poor beggar, then, I suppose, with a full belly, joking and joyous: and I sighed, and spoke to the friends around me, of the many sorrows of our frenzies; for that by all such efforts of ours, as those wherein I then toiled dragging along, under the goading of desire, the burthen of my own wretchedness, and, by dragging, augmenting it, we yet looked to arrive only at that very joyousness whither that beggar-man had arrived before us, who should never perchance attain it. For what he had obtained by means of a few begged pence, the same was I plotting for by many a toilsome turning and winding; the joy of a temporary felicity. For he verily had not the true joy; but yet I with those my ambitious designs was seeking one much less true. And certainly he was joyous, I anxious; he void of care, I full of fears. But should any ask me, had I rather be merry or fearful? I would answer merry. Again, if he asked had I rather be such as he was, or what I then was? I should choose to be myself, though worn with cares and fears; but out of wrong judgment; for, was it the truth? For I ought not to prefer myself to him, because more learned than he, seeing I had no joy therein, but sought to please men by it; and that not to instruct, but simply to please.

But Thou, O Lord, who guidest the course of all Thou hast created, hadst not forgotten him, who was one day to be among Thy children, Priest and Dispenser of Thy Sacrament; and that his amendment might plainly be attributed to Thyself, Thou effectedst it through me, unknowingly. For as one day I sat in my accustomed place, with my scholars before me, he entered, greeted me, sat down, and applied his mind to what I then handled. I had by chance a passage in hand, which while I was explaining, a likeness from the Circensian races occurred to me, as likely to make what I would convey pleasanter and plainer, seasoned with biting mockery of those whom that madness had enthralled; God, Thou knowest that I then thought not of curing Alypius of that infection. But he took it wholly to himself, and thought that I said it simply for his sake. And whence another would have taken occasion of offence with me, that right-minded youth took as a ground of being offended at himself, and loving me more fervently. For Thou hadst said it long ago, and put it into Thy book, Rebuke a wise man and he will love Thee. But I had not rebuked him, but Thou, who employest all, knowing or not knowing, in that order which Thyself knowest (and that order is just), didst of my heart and tongue make burning coals, by which to set on fire the hopeful mind, thus languishing, and so cure it. Let him be silent in Thy praises, who considers not Thy mercies, which confess unto Thee out of my inmost soul. For he upon that speech burst out of that pit so deep, wherein he was wilfully plunged, and was blinded with its wretched pastimes; and he shook his mind with a strong self-command; whereupon all the filths of the Circensian pastimes flew off from him, nor came he again thither. Upon this, he prevailed with his unwilling father that he might be my scholar. He gave way, and gave in. And Alypius beginning to be my hearer again, was involved in the same superstition with me, loving in the Manichees that show of continency which he supposed true and unfeigned.

For being utterly averse to and detesting spectacles, he was one day by chance met by divers of his acquaintance and fellow-students coming from dinner, and they with a familiar violence haled him, vehemently refusing and resisting, into the Amphitheatre, during these cruel and deadly shows, he thus protesting: ""Though you hale my body to that place, and there set me, can you force me also to turn my mind or my eyes to those shows? I shall then be absent while present, and so shall overcome both you and them."" They, hearing this, led him on nevertheless, desirous perchance to try that very thing, whether he could do as he said. When they were come thither, and had taken their places as they could, the whole place kindled with that savage pastime. But he, closing the passage of his eyes, forbade his mind to range abroad after such evil; and would he had stopped his ears also! For in the fight, when one fell, a mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly, overcome by curiosity, and as if prepared to despise and be superior to it whatsoever it were, even when seen, he opened his eyes, and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the other, whom he desired to behold, was in his body; and he fell more miserably than he upon whose fall that mighty noise was raised, which entered through his ears, and unlocked his eyes, to make way for the striking and beating down of a soul, bold rather than resolute, and the weaker, in that it had presumed on itself, which ought to have relied on Thee. For so soon as he saw that blood, he therewith drunk down savageness; nor turned away, but fixed his eye, drinking in frenzy, unawares, and was delighted with that guilty fight, and intoxicated with the bloody pastime. Nor was he now the man he came, but one of the throng he came unto, yea, a true associate of theirs that brought him thither. Why say more? He beheld, shouted, kindled, carried thence with him the madness which should goad him to return not only with them who first drew him thither, but also before them, yea and to draw in others.

So was that also, that when he was yet studying under me at Carthage, and was thinking over at mid-day in the market-place what he was to say by heart (as scholars use to practise), Thou sufferedst him to be apprehended by the officers of the market-place for a thief. For no other cause, I deem, didst Thou, our God, suffer it, but that he who was hereafter to prove so great a man, should already begin to learn that in judging of causes, man was not readily to be condemned by man out of a rash credulity. For as he was walking up and down by himself before the judgment-seat, with his note-book and pen, lo, a young man, a lawyer, the real thief, privily bringing a hatchet, got in, unperceived by Alypius, as far as the leaden gratings which fence in the silversmiths' shops, and began to cut away the lead. But the noise of the hatchet being heard, the silversmiths beneath began to make a stir, and sent to apprehend whomever they should find. But he, hearing their voices, ran away, leaving his hatchet, fearing to be taken with it. Alypius now, who had not seen him enter, was aware of his going, and saw with what speed he made away. And being desirous to know the matter, entered the place; where finding the hatchet, he was standing, wondering and considering it, when behold, those that had been sent, find him alone with the hatchet in his hand, the noise whereof had startled and brought them thither. They seize him, hale him away, and gathering the dwellers in the market-place together, boast of having taken a notorious thief, and so he was being led away to be taken before the judge.",but this was already being laid up in his memory to be a medicine hereafter so was that also that when he was yet studying under me at carthage and was thinking over at mid day in the market place what he was to say by heart as scholars use to practise thou sufferedst him to be apprehended by the officers of the market place for a thief for no other because i deem didst thou our god suffer it but that he who was hereafter to prove so great a man should already begin to learn that in judging of causes man was not readily to be condemned by man out of a rash credulity for as he was walking up and down by himself before the judgment seat with his note book and pen lo a young man a lawyer the real thief privily bringing a hatchet got in unperceived by alypius as far as the leaden gratings which fence in the silversmiths shops and began to cut away the lead but the noise of the hatchet being heard the silversmiths beneath began to make a stir and sent to apprehend whomever they should find but he hearing their voices ran away leaving his hatchet fearing to be taken with it alypius now who had not seen him enter was aware of his going and saw with what speed he made away and being desirous to know the matter entered the place where finding the hatchet he was standing wondering and considering it when behold those that had been sent find him alone with the hatchet in his hand the noise whereof had startled and brought them thither they seize him hale him away and gathering the dwellers in the market place together boast of having taken a notorious thief and so he was being led away to be taken before the judge,315,1681,-5.3999999999999995,-1.2159981875785386,-1.1959459459459456,-1.0489415973827643,-4.15,-1.1088709781778385,-1.0540540540540544,-0.9899290600688313,0.0,-0.210902761844609,-0.1334106134690837,-0.15571071641162115,-3.48125,-1.0920573641629399,-1.158386693117656,-0.9233525805008952,1.8440000000000025,-1.0972376484403035,-0.724469320942021,-0.9209584336827303,-6.3481694255786705,-0.7962058505432142,-0.7045383407749759,-0.6325829222285517,-1.5377852707533288,-0.8259979702045804,-0.9219932400656283,-0.7693696327665462,"{'neg': 0.137, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.9836}",-0.9836,-1.0902502050199228,-2.3481144822503377,-1.786418907296286,0.10569444444444447,-0.21964733780811427,-0.369529105700689,-0.3448248412677957,-0.9978,-0.37543283516801745,-0.22279155564664893,-0.15644760024902826,0.2029379094616963,-0.5843125390525729,-0.43901424790237414,-0.5365939809712996,53.3098893861154,-0.6013503084063605,0.642041836791464,-0.7317808190714419

For as he was being led either to prison or to punishment, a certain architect met them, who had the chief charge of the public buildings. Glad they were to meet him especially, by whom they were wont to be suspected of stealing the goods lost out of the marketplace, as though to show him at last by whom these thefts were committed. He, however, had divers times seen Alypius at a certain senator's house, to whom he often went to pay his respects; and recognising him immediately, took him aside by the hand, and enquiring the occasion of so great a calamity, heard the whole matter, and bade all present, amid much uproar and threats, to go with him. So they came to the house of the young man who had done the deed. There, before the door, was a boy so young as to be likely, not apprehending any harm to his master, to disclose the whole. For he had attended his master to the market-place. Whom so soon as Alypius remembered, he told the architect: and he showing the hatchet to the boy, asked him ""Whose that was?"" ""Ours,"" quoth he presently: and being further questioned, he discovered every thing. Thus the crime being transferred to that house, and the multitude ashamed, which had begun to insult over Alypius, he who was to be a dispenser of Thy Word, and an examiner of many causes in Thy Church, went away better experienced and instructed.",but thus far was alypius to be instructed for forthwith o lord thou succouredst his innocency whereof thou alone wert witness for as he was being led either to prison or to punishment a certain architect met them who had the chief charge of the public buildings glad they were to meet him especially by whom they were will not to be suspected of stealing the goods lost out of the marketplace as though to show him at last by whom these thefts were committed he however had divers times seen alypius at a certain senator own house to whom he often went to pay his respects and recognising him immediately took him aside by the hand and enquiring the occasion of so great a calamity heard the whole matter and bade all present amid much uproar and threats to go with him so they came to the house of the young man who had done the deed there before the door was a boy so young as to be likely not apprehending any harm to his master to disclose the whole for he had attended his master to the market place whom so soon as alypius remembered he told the architect and he showing the hatchet to the boy asked him whose that was ours quoth he presently and being further questioned he discovered every thing thus the crime being transferred to that house and the multitude ashamed which had begun to insult over alypius he who was to be a dispenser of thy word and an examiner of many causes in thy church went away better experienced and instructed,271,1486,-0.8000000000000002,-0.6873534366404277,-0.5743243243243243,-0.5969435449898544,-1.1999999999999997,-0.7755922468283784,-0.6554054054054056,-0.6997781090205495,-60.586610276532696,-0.6523240857234865,-0.6383511251044164,-0.584072957016956,-0.34375,-0.44702000588614105,-0.35402227987181445,-0.35495592668882686,13.843000000000004,0.41363417520089824,0.5427183440701238,0.32893153490394017,19.228157626803984,-0.40039149955850234,-0.29621316372252954,-0.3129296653185231,-2.1044808740321352,-1.0347576505651035,-1.0993867753274582,-0.9733687276413482,"{'neg': 0.122, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.1744}",0.1744,-0.3561248237722442,-0.9256848053064735,-0.7441540049927321,0.23945578231292522,-0.04647979922110325,0.33766829994837855,0.2478224571298169,-0.9988,-0.4350199655019017,-0.22330395572863296,-0.22325967304783628,0.8960201287725408,0.3234544972788964,0.7276833080562558,0.5135753321387498,47.526193071892386,-0.3909380371263472,0.2838817168798149,-0.39235777672737654

There he had thrice sat as Assessor, with an uncorruptness much wondered at by others, he wondering at others rather who could prefer gold to honesty. His character was tried besides, not only with the bait of covetousness, but with the goad of fear. At Rome he was Assessor to the count of the Italian Treasury. There was at that time a very powerful senator, to whose favours many stood indebted, many much feared. He would needs, by his usual power, have a thing allowed him which by the laws was unallowed. Alypius resisted it: a bribe was promised; with all his heart he scorned it: threats were held out; he trampled upon them: all wondering at so unwonted a spirit, which neither desired the friendship, nor feared the enmity of one so great and so mightily renowned for innumerable means of doing good or evil. And the very judge, whose councillor Alypius was, although also unwilling it should be, yet did not openly refuse, but put the matter off upon Alypius, alleging that he would not allow him to do it: for in truth had the judge done it, Alypius would have decided otherwise. With this one thing in the way of learning was he well-nigh seduced, that he might have books copied for him at Praetorian prices, but consulting justice, he altered his deliberation for the better; esteeming equity whereby he was hindered more gainful than the power whereby he were allowed. These are slight things, but he that is faithful in little, is faithful also in much. Nor can that any how be void, which proceeded out of the mouth of Thy Truth: If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your trust true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? He being such, did at that time cleave to me, and with me wavered in purpose, what course of life was to be taken.",him then i had found at rome and he clave to me by a most strong tie and went with me to milan both that he might not leave me and might practise something of the law he had studied more to please his parents than himself there he had thrice sat as assessor with an uncorruptness much wondered at by others he wondering at others rather who could prefer gold to honesty his character was tried besides not only with the bait of covetousness but with the goad of fear at rome he was assessor to the count of the italian treasury there was at that time a very powerful senator to whose favours many stood indebted many much feared he would needs by his usual power have a thing allowed him which by the laws was unallowed alypius resisted it a bribe was promised with all his heart he scorned it threats were held out he trampled upon them all wondering at so unwonted a spirit which neither desired the friendship nor feared the enmity of one so great and so mightily renowned for innumerable means of doing good or evil and the very judge whose councillor alypius was although also unwilling it should be yet did not openly refuse but put the matter off upon alypius alleging that he would not allow him to do it for in truth had the judge done it alypius would have decided otherwise with this one thing in the way of learning was he well nigh seduced that he might have books copied for him at praetorian prices but consulting justice he altered his deliberation for the better esteeming equity whereby he was hindered more gainful than the power whereby he were allowed these are slight things but he that is faithful in little is faithful also in much nor can that any how be void which proceeded out of the mouth of thy truth if ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust true riches and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man own who shall give you that which is your own he being such did at that time cleave to me and with me wavered in purpose what course of life was to be taken,389,2097,12.950000000000001,0.6627733766635696,1.2837837837837835,0.5574322225060299,13.450000000000001,0.7106109240520597,1.3243243243243246,0.5941036269542885,172.32517083325868,0.6637689098147772,1.3027806428338835,0.6930845202426837,-0.30064999999999986,-0.414345229947905,-0.34297268426674804,-0.32616343417805554,21.374999999999993,0.542829705450164,1.338156088288097,0.4358103546145531,87.69962988029123,0.27082852652481826,0.7969315233032904,0.22913675270545347,4.7826536698197515,0.4174440531030505,1.056502801879444,0.4457167615313493,"{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.9932}",0.9932,0.016128849205482722,0.08008844122343682,-0.2156517245799929,0.23219135802469135,-0.13706882407110507,0.29926122289578255,-0.06220874894898087,-0.9987,-0.3063809364862371,-0.22325271572043456,-0.07902315547761161,1.0678968671407216,0.13211749707411582,1.017011420931074,0.292223115065932,65.30796045684902,-0.6476790948435533,1.3850321910455206,-0.8065153274010147

We must not lightly abandon them, for it were a shame to return again to them. See, it is no great matter now to obtain some station, and then what should we more wish for? We have store of powerful friends; if nothing else offer, and we be in much haste, at least a presidentship may be given us: and a wife with some money, that she increase not our charges: and this shall be the bound of desire. Many great men, and most worthy of imitation, have given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage.""",perish every thing dismiss we these empty vanities and betake ourselves to the one search for truth life is vain death uncertain if it steals upon us on a sudden in what state shall we depart hence and where shall we learn what here we have neglected and shall we not rather suffer the punishment of this negligence what if death itself cut off and end all care and feeling then must this be ascertained but god forbid this it is no vain and empty thing that the excellent dignity of the authority of the christian faith hath overspread the whole world never would such and so great things be by god wrought for us if with the death of the body the life of the soul came to an end wherefore delay then to abandon worldly hopes and give ourselves wholly to seek after god and the blessed life but wait even those things are pleasant they have some and no small sweetness we must not lightly abandon them for it were a shame to return again to them see it is no great matter now to obtain some station and then what should we more wish for we have store of powerful friends if nothing else offer and we be in much haste at least a presidentship may be given us and a wife with some money that she increase not our charges and this shall be the bound of desire many great men and most worthy of imitation have given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage,264,1411,1.7499999999999996,-0.3304433985205076,-0.22972972972972983,-0.291780877956073,0.7499999999999994,-0.49861617119022333,-0.39189189189189216,-0.4586439945253622,-76.034651752516,-0.7795639380681955,-0.7670980863726587,-0.7075485240007277,2.3354166666666667,0.21988016095306304,0.332838699832138,0.23270588606380677,11.652999999999999,0.18176037625794877,0.31143732178688327,0.13711067310613612,12.840309035139331,-0.49734091305802963,-0.39819494561926605,-0.39122444089586944,1.233273919972209,-0.13441530969249538,-0.05456461803563908,-0.0935579217506685,"{'neg': 0.148, 'neu': 0.584, 'pos': 0.269, 'compound': 0.9946}",0.9946,0.25281594031716476,0.08180813167915488,0.12038167542964577,0.22658730158730156,-0.05447854080301178,0.26963252571925045,0.22044762332563467,-0.9949,-0.4445623477190586,-0.2213055954088953,-0.23395906957514648,1.1069440875948076,0.6257898151241883,1.0827414243873135,0.8633382783166753,47.216772936078854,-0.27166562120689797,0.26472062215332914,-0.19995547037504877

We thought there might be some often persons in this society; some of whom were very rich, especially Romanianus our townsman, from childhood a very familiar friend of mine, whom the grievous perplexities of his affairs had brought up to court; who was the most earnest for this project; and therein was his voice of great weight, because his ample estate far exceeded any of the rest. We had settled also that two annual officers, as it were, should provide all things necessary, the rest being undisturbed.

But what else to conceive of Thee I knew not. And I, a man, and such a man, sought to conceive of Thee the sovereign, only, true God; and I did in my inmost soul believe that Thou wert incorruptible, and uninjurable, and unchangeable; because though not knowing whence or how, yet I saw plainly, and was sure, that that which may be corrupted must be inferior to that which cannot; what could not be injured I preferred unhesitatingly to what could receive injury; the unchangeable to things subject to change.

For over such forms as my eyes are wont to range, did my heart then range: nor yet did I see that this same notion of the mind, whereby I formed those very images, was not of this sort, and yet it could not have formed them, had not itself been some great thing. So also did I endeavour to conceive of Thee, Life of my life, as vast, through infinite spaces on every side penetrating the whole mass of the universe, and beyond it, every way, through unmeasurable boundless spaces; so that the earth should have Thee, the heaven have Thee, all things have Thee, and they be bounded in Thee, and Thou bounded nowhere. For that as the body of this air which is above the earth, hindereth not the light of the sun from passing through it, penetrating it, not by bursting or by cutting, but by filling it wholly: so I thought the body not of heaven, air, and sea only, but of the earth too, pervious to Thee, so that in all its parts, the greatest as the smallest, it should admit Thy presence, by a secret inspiration, within and without, directing all things which Thou hast created. So I guessed, only as unable to conceive aught else, for it was false.

167,167,1317,1329,1342,"And I sought ""whence is evil,"" and sought in an evil way; and saw not the evil in my very search. I set now before the sight of my spirit the whole creation, whatsoever we can see therein (as sea, earth, air, stars, trees, mortal creatures); yea, and whatever in it we do not see, as the firmament of heaven, all angels moreover, and all the spiritual inhabitants thereof. But these very beings, as though they were bodies, did my fancy dispose in place, and I made one great mass of Thy creation, distinguished as to the kinds of bodies; some, real bodies, some, what myself had feigned for spirits. And this mass I made huge, not as it was (which I could not know), but as I thought convenient, yet every way finite. But Thee, O Lord, I imagined on every part environing and penetrating it, though every way infinite: as if there were a sea, every where, and on every side, through unmeasured space, one only boundless sea, and it contained within it some sponge, huge, but bounded; that sponge must needs, in all its parts, be filled from that unmeasurable sea: so conceived I Thy creation, itself finite, full of Thee, the Infinite; and I said, Behold God, and behold what God hath created; and God is good, yea, most mightily and incomparably better than all these: but yet He, the Good, created them good; and see how He environeth and fulfils them. Where is evil then, and whence, and how crept it in hither? What is its root, and what its seed? Or hath it no being? Why then fear we and avoid what is not? Or if we fear it idly, then is that very fear evil, whereby the soul is thus idly goaded and racked. Yea, and so much a greater evil, as we have nothing to fear, and yet do fear. Therefore either is that evil which we fear, or else evil is, that we fear. Whence is it then? seeing God, the Good, hath created all these things good. He indeed, the greater and chiefest Good, hath created these lesser goods; still both Creator and created, all are good. Whence is evil? Or, was there some evil matter of which He made, and formed, and ordered it, yet left something in it which He did not convert into good? Why so then? Had He no might to turn and change the whole, so that no evil should remain in it, seeing He is All-mighty? Lastly, why would He make any thing at all of it, and not rather by the same All-mightiness cause it not to be at all? Or, could it then be against His will? Or if it were from eternity, why suffered He it so to be for infinite spaces of times past, and was pleased so long after to make something out of it? Or if He were suddenly pleased now to effect somewhat, this rather should the All-mighty have effected, that this evil matter should not be, and He alone be, the whole, true, sovereign, and infinite Good. Or if it was not good that He who was good should not also frame and create something that were good, then, that evil matter being taken away and brought to nothing, He might form good matter, whereof to create all things. For He should not be All-mighty, if He might not create something good without the aid of that matter which Himself had not created. These thoughts I revolved in my miserable heart, overcharged with most gnawing cares, lest I should die ere I had found the truth; yet was the faith of Thy Christ, our Lord and Saviour, professed in the Church Catholic, firmly fixed in my heart, in many points, indeed, as yet unformed, and fluctuating from the rule of doctrine; yet did not my mind utterly leave it, but rather daily took in more and more of it.",and i sought whence is evil and sought in an evil way and saw not the evil in my very search i set now before the sight of my spirit the whole creation whatsoever we can see therein as sea earth air stars trees mortal creatures yea and whatever in it we do not see as the firmament of heaven all angels moreover and all the spiritual inhabitants thereof but these very beings as though they were bodies did my fancy dispose in place and i made one great mass of thy creation distinguished as to the kinds of bodies some real bodies some what myself had feigned for spirits and this mass i made huge not as it was which i could not know but as i thought convenient yet every way finite but thee o lord i imagined on every part environing and penetrating it though every way infinite as if there were a sea every where and on every side through unmeasured space one only boundless sea and it contained within it some sponge huge but bounded that sponge must needs in all its parts be filled from that unmeasurable sea so conceived i thy creation itself finite full of thee the infinite and i said behold god and behold what god hath created and god is good yea most mightily and incomparably better than all these but yet he the good created them good and see how he environeth and fulfils them where is evil then and whence and how crept it in hither what is its root and what its seed or hath it no being why then fear we and avoid what is not or if we fear it idly then is that very fear evil whereby the soul is thus idly goaded and racked yea and so much a greater evil as we have nothing to fear and yet do fear therefore either is that evil which we fear or else evil is that we fear whence is it then seeing god the good hath created all these things good he indeed the greater and chiefest good hath created these lesser goods still both creator and created all are good whence is evil or was there some evil matter of which he made and formed and ordered it yet left something in it which he did not convert into good why so then had he no might to turn and change the whole so that no evil should remain in it seeing he is all mighty lastly why would he make any thing at all of it and not rather by the same all mightiness because it not to be at all or could it then be against his will or if it were from eternity why suffered he it so to be for infinite spaces of times past and was pleased so long after to make something out of it or if he were suddenly pleased now to effect somewhat this rather should the all mighty have effected that this evil matter should not be and he alone be the whole true sovereign and infinite good or if it was not good that he who was good should not also frame and create something that were good then that evil matter being taken away and brought to nothing he might form good matter whereof to create all things for he should not be all mighty if he might not create something good without the aid of that matter which himself had not created these thoughts i revolved in my miserable heart overcharged with most gnawing cares lest i should die ere i had found the truth yet was the faith of thy christ our lord and saviour professed in the church catholic firmly fixed in my heart in many points indeed as yet unformed and fluctuating from the rule of doctrine yet did not my mind utterly leave it but rather daily took in more and more of it,667,3525,10.399999999999999,0.0034668535865895606,0.9391891891891887,-0.006283323391112287,9.149999999999999,-0.08415031420141335,0.743243243243243,-0.09781190033376515,39.98512528860038,-0.09253905110857402,0.19983314334246197,-0.040848697758525794,20.044940476190487,1.6180750895141964,4.873049290401346,1.4647730036866553,13.956999999999997,-0.5937696573820532,0.5547576301615794,-0.5044574561136164,115.13204704862876,0.041273807492177864,1.2348891148799315,0.04375208083769638,1.8174135352710483,-0.2753425863000769,0.12828944125969224,-0.23127147266945022,"{'neg': 0.151, 'neu': 0.674, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.0421}",0.0421,-0.46926733447889524,-1.0881955533718215,-0.9047866038379438,0.09632352941176472,-0.28003570823634333,-0.4190732184112314,-0.5514975518748211,-0.7495,-0.1403085635209432,-0.0955626152900185,0.10718550082545047,0.9980361648655259,-0.2937634027728016,0.8994116494594167,-0.2004661258502976,100.10919556784691,-1.2580330748530055,3.5401271101505487,-1.7910976597019714
168,168,1343,1347,1352,"By this time also had I rejected the lying divinations and impious dotages of the astrologers. Let Thine own mercies, out of my very inmost soul, confess unto Thee for this also, O my God. For Thou, Thou altogether (for who else calls us back from the death of all errors, save the Life which cannot die, and the Wisdom which needing no light enlightens the minds that need it, whereby the universe is directed, down to the whirling leaves of trees?)—Thou madest provision for my obstinacy wherewith I struggled against Vindicianus, an acute old man, and Nebridius, a young man of admirable talents; the first vehemently affirming, and the latter often (though with some doubtfulness) saying, ""That there was no such art whereby to foresee things to come, but that men's conjectures were a sort of lottery, and that out of many things which they said should come to pass, some actually did, unawares to them who spake it, who stumbled upon it, through their oft speaking."" Thou providedst then a friend for me, no negligent consulter of the astrologers; nor yet well skilled in those arts, but (as I said) a curious consulter with them, and yet knowing something, which he said he had heard of his father, which how far it went to overthrow the estimation of that art, he knew not. This man then, Firminus by name, having had a liberal education, and well taught in Rhetoric, consulted me, as one very dear to him, what, according to his so-called constellations, I thought on certain affairs of his, wherein his worldly hopes had risen, and I, who had herein now begun to incline towards Nebridius' opinion, did not altogether refuse to conjecture, and tell him what came into my unresolved mind; but added, that I was now almost persuaded that these were but empty and ridiculous follies. Thereupon he told me that his father had been very curious in such books, and had a friend as earnest in them as himself, who with joint study and conference fanned the flame of their affections to these toys, so that they would observe the moments whereat the very dumb animals, which bred about their houses, gave birth, and then observed the relative position of the heavens, thereby to make fresh experiments in this so-called art. He said then that he had heard of his father, that what time his mother was about to give birth to him, Firminus, a woman-servant of that friend of his father's was also with child, which could not escape her master, who took care with most exact diligence to know the births of his very puppies. And so it was that (the one for his wife, and the other for his servant, with the most careful observation, reckoning days, hours, nay, the lesser divisions of the hours) both were delivered at the same instant; so that both were constrained to allow the same constellations, even to the minutest points, the one for his son, the other for his new-born slave. For so soon as the women began to be in labour, they each gave notice to the other what was fallen out in their houses, and had messengers ready to send to one another so soon as they had notice of the actual birth, of which they had easily provided, each in his own province, to give instant intelligence. Thus then the messengers of the respective parties met, he averred, at such an equal distance from either house that neither of them could make out any difference in the position of the stars, or any other minutest points; and yet Firminus, born in a high estate in his parents' house, ran his course through the gilded paths of life, was increased in riches, raised to honours; whereas that slave continued to serve his masters, without any relaxation of his yoke, as Firminus, who knew him, told me.",by this time also had i rejected the lying divinations and impious dotages of the astrologers let thine own mercies out of my very inmost soul confess unto thee for this also o my god for thou thou altogether for who else calls us back from the death of all errors save the life which cannot die and the wisdom which needing no light enlightens the minds that need it whereby the universe is directed down to the whirling leaves of trees—thou madest provision for my obstinacy wherewith i struggled against vindicianus an acute old man and nebridius a young man of admirable talents the first vehemently affirming and the latter often though with some doubtfulness saying that there was no such art whereby to foresee things to come but that men own conjectures were a sort of lottery and that out of many things which they said should come to pass some actually did unawares to them who spake it who stumbled upon it through their oft speaking thou providedst then a friend for me no negligent consulter of the astrologers nor yet well skilled in those arts but as i said a curious consulter with them and yet knowing something which he said he had heard of his father which how far it went to overthrow the estimation of that art he knew not this man then firminus by name having had a liberal education and well taught in rhetoric consulted me as one very dear to him what according to his so called constellations i thought on certain affairs of his wherein his worldly hopes had risen and i who had herein now begun to incline towards nebridius opinion did not altogether refuse to conjecture and tell him what came into my unresolved mind but added that i was now almost persuaded that these were but empty and ridiculous follies thereupon he told me that his father had been very curious in such books and had a friend as earnest in them as himself who with joint study and conference fanned the flame of their affections to these toys so that they would observe the moments whereat the very dumb animals which bred about their houses gave birth and then observed the relative position of the heavens thereby to make fresh experiments in this so called art he said then that he had heard of his father that what time his mother was about to give birth to him firminus a woman servant of that friend of his father own was also with child which could not escape her master who took care with most exact diligence to know the births of his very puppies and so it was that the one for his wife and the other for his servant with the most careful observation reckoning days hours nay the lesser divisions of the hours both were delivered at the same instant so that both were constrained to allow the same constellations even to the minutest points the one for his son the other for his new born slave for so soon as the women began to be in labour they each gave notice to the other what was fallen out in their houses and had messengers ready to send to one another so soon as they had notice of the actual birth of which they had easily provided each in his own province to give instant intelligence thus then the messengers of the respective parties met he averred at such an equal distance from either house that neither of them could make out any difference in the position of the stars or any other minutest points and yet firminus born in a high estate in his parents house ran his course through the gilded paths of life was increased in riches raised to honours whereas that slave continued to serve his masters without any relaxation of his yoke as firminus who knew him told me,660,3692,9.65,-0.032705082235801756,0.8378378378378376,-0.03721079314086162,9.2,-0.07571969327662981,0.7499999999999998,-0.09047224001596176,-93.43000429965379,-0.49040698743137395,-0.9120743142081175,-0.42694604160823146,4.427866666666667,0.07895460332093332,0.8692824660460858,0.10852452762482928,14.527000000000001,-0.557504875928463,0.6149540606188615,-0.4744569055423626,60.63457783802953,-0.30951195269949183,0.3648389032622648,-0.23953681569667523,-1.2135480808057035,-0.605699445743684,-0.8204968087268575,-0.5540948272357762,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956,-0.18752091157486656,0.08303648200466772,-0.5047808072213432,0.11475187590187591,-0.27072952715067367,-0.32164238349372515,-0.5196481468199019,0.8395,0.13527673638569532,0.7186411149825783,0.41618553181324,1.0581113538812024,-0.257313278775625,1.000539011041474,-0.1582980362977335,101.93803878767909,-1.1084172888767554,3.65337972082167,-1.549747452559461

These things being safe and immovably settled in my mind, I sought anxiously ""whence was evil?""

Did the whole tumult of my soul, for which neither time nor utterance sufficed, reach them? Yet went up the whole to Thy hearing, all which I roared out from the groanings of my heart; and my desire was before Thee, and the light of mine eyes was not with me: for that was within, I without: nor was that confined to place, but I was intent on things contained in place, but there found I no resting-place, nor did they so receive me, that I could say, ""It is enough,"" ""it is well"": nor did they yet suffer me to turn back, where it might be well enough with me. For to these things was I superior, but inferior to Thee; and Thou art my true joy when subjected to Thee, and Thou hadst subjected to me what Thou createdst below me. And this was the true temperament, and middle region of my safety, to remain in Thy Image, and by serving Thee, rule the body. But when I rose proudly against Thee, and ran against the Lord with my neck, with the thick bosses of my buckler, even these inferior things were set above me, and pressed me down, and no where was there respite or space of breathing. They met my sight on all sides by heaps and troops, and in thought the images thereof presented themselves unsought, as I would return to Thee, as if they would say unto me, ""Whither goest thou, unworthy and defiled?""

But that in due time He died for the ungodly; and that Thou sparedst not Thine Only Son, but deliveredst Him for us all, is not there.

But such as are lifted up in the lofty walk of some would-be sublimer learning, hear not Him, saying, Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls.

176,176,1399,1408,1417,"And being thence admonished to return to myself, I entered even into my inward self, Thou being my Guide: and able I was, for Thou wert become my Helper. And I entered and beheld with the eye of my soul (such as it was), above the same eye of my soul, above my mind, the Light Unchangeable. Not this ordinary light, which all flesh may look upon, nor as it were a greater of the same kind, as though the brightness of this should be manifold brighter, and with its greatness take up all space. Not such was this light, but other, yea, far other from these. Nor was it above my soul, as oil is above water, nor yet as heaven above earth: but above to my soul, because It made me; and I below It, because I was made by It. He that knows the Truth, knows what that Light is; and he that knows It, knows eternity. Love knoweth it. O Truth Who art Eternity! and Love Who art Truth! and Eternity Who art Love! Thou art my God, to Thee do I sigh night and day. Thee when I first knew, Thou liftedst me up, that I might see there was what I might see, and that I was not yet such as to see. And Thou didst beat back the weakness of my sight, streaming forth Thy beams of light upon me most strongly, and I trembled with love and awe: and I perceived myself to be far off from Thee, in the region of unlikeness, as if I heard this Thy voice from on high: ""I am the food of grown men, grow, and thou shalt feed upon Me; nor shalt thou convert Me, like the food of thy flesh into thee, but thou shalt be converted into Me."" And I learned, that Thou for iniquity chastenest man, and Thou madest my soul to consume away like a spider. And I said, ""Is Truth therefore nothing because it is not diffused through space finite or infinite?"" And Thou criedst to me from afar: ""Yet verily, I AM that I AM."" And I heard, as the heart heareth, nor had I room to doubt, and I should sooner doubt that I live than that Truth is not, which is clearly seen, being understood by those things which are made.

182,182,1445,1450,1455,"And I wondered that I now loved Thee, and no phantasm for Thee. And yet did I not press on to enjoy my God; but was borne up to Thee by Thy beauty, and soon borne down from Thee by mine own weight, sinking with sorrow into these inferior things. This weight was carnal custom. Yet dwelt there with me a remembrance of Thee; nor did I any way doubt that there was One to whom I might cleave, but that I was not yet such as to cleave to Thee: for that the body which is corrupted presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things. And most certain I was, that Thy invisible works from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even Thy eternal power and Godhead. For examining whence it was that I admired the beauty of bodies celestial or terrestrial; and what aided me in judging soundly on things mutable, and pronouncing, ""This ought to be thus, this not""; examining, I say, whence it was that I so judged, seeing I did so judge, I had found the unchangeable and true Eternity of Truth above my changeable mind. And thus by degrees I passed from bodies to the soul, which through the bodily senses perceives; and thence to its inward faculty, to which the bodily senses represent things external, whitherto reach the faculties of beasts; and thence again to the reasoning faculty, to which what is received from the senses of the body, is referred to be judged. Which finding itself also to be in me a thing variable, raised itself up to its own understanding, and drew away my thoughts from the power of habit, withdrawing itself from those troops of contradictory phantasms; that so it might find what that light was whereby it was bedewed, when, without all doubting, it cried out, ""That the unchangeable was to be preferred to the changeable""; whence also it knew That Unchangeable, which, unless it had in some way known, it had had no sure ground to prefer it to the changeable. And thus with the flash of one trembling glance it arrived at THAT WHICH IS. And then I saw Thy invisible things understood by the things which are made. But I could not fix my gaze thereon; and my infirmity being struck back, I was thrown again on my wonted habits, carrying along with me only a loving memory thereof, and a longing for what I had, as it were, perceived the odour of, but was not yet able to feed on.",and i wondered that i now loved thee and no phantasm for thee and yet did i not press on to enjoy my god but was borne up to thee by thy beauty and soon borne down from thee by mine own weight sinking with sorrow into these inferior things this weight was carnal custom yet dwelt there with me a remembrance of thee nor did i any way doubt that there was one to whom i might cleave but that i was not yet such as to cleave to thee for that the body which is corrupted presseth down the soul and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things and most certain i was that thy invisible works from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even thy eternal power and godhead for examining whence it was that i admired the beauty of bodies celestial or terrestrial and what aided me in judging soundly on things mutable and pronouncing this ought to be thus this not examining i say whence it was that i so judged seeing i did so judge i had found the unchangeable and true eternity of truth above my changeable mind and thus by degrees i passed from bodies to the soul which through the bodily senses perceives and thence to its inward faculty to which the bodily senses represent things external whitherto reach the faculties of beasts and thence again to the reasoning faculty to which what is received from the senses of the body is referred to be judged which finding itself also to be in me a thing variable raised itself up to its own understanding and drew away my thoughts from the power of habit withdrawing itself from those troops of contradictory phantasms that so it might find what that light was whereby it was bedewed when without all doubting it cried out that the unchangeable was to be preferred to the changeable whence also it knew that unchangeable which unless it had in some way known it had had no sure ground to prefer it to the changeable and thus with the flash of one trembling glance it arrived at that which is and then i saw thy invisible things understood by the things which are made but i could not fix my gaze thereon and my infirmity being struck back i was thrown again on my wonted habits carrying along with me only a loving memory thereof and a longing for what i had as it were perceived the odour of but was not yet able to feed on,444,2406,-3.0,-0.8290892913631522,-0.8716216216216216,-0.7181295213477582,0.3000000000000005,-0.5811201884199299,-0.4527027027027028,-0.5304716175110075,-14.09279487114647,-0.2735728210751668,-0.25086268778268456,-0.21652673398633385,-0.6145833333333333,-0.4546515890442194,-0.423456126964749,-0.36168075630478663,9.563000000000002,-0.5732832441638982,0.09071707677685095,-0.48750978260946476,18.63837412220572,-0.5262723348837748,-0.3056290369808152,-0.4145889884182874,0.80699508993799,-0.3410163824184506,-0.1880032899249695,-0.2954476341868636,"{'neg': 0.061, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.9617}",0.9617,-0.05935271650615199,0.04139540596978252,-0.32281568964880725,0.20590476190476192,-0.17913723656839847,0.16028375096262093,-0.2061833715476033,-0.9985,-0.2697446777632703,-0.22315023570403777,-0.03794474859412201,0.9659005081649056,-0.062177099930642264,0.8453162029350209,0.06744934017532775,71.6611639864935,-0.8701663120290517,1.7784595105963172,-1.1654168671276093

184,184,1460,1466,1472,"But I thought otherwise; conceiving only of my Lord Christ as of a man of excellent wisdom, whom no one could be equalled unto; especially, for that being wonderfully born of a Virgin, He seemed, in conformity therewith, through the Divine care for us, to have attained that great eminence of authority, for an ensample of despising things temporal for the obtaining of immortality. But what mystery there lay in ""The Word was made flesh,"" I could not even imagine. Only I had learnt out of what is delivered to us in writing of Him that He did eat, and drink, sleep, walk, rejoiced in spirit, was sorrowful, discoursed; that flesh did not cleave by itself unto Thy Word, but with the human soul and mind. All know this who know the unchangeableness of Thy Word, which I now knew, as far as I could, nor did I at all doubt thereof. For, now to move the limbs of the body by will, now not, now to be moved by some affection, now not, now to deliver wise sayings through human signs, now to keep silence, belong to soul and mind subject to variation. And should these things be falsely written of Him, all the rest also would risk the charge, nor would there remain in those books any saving faith for mankind. Since then they were written truly, I acknowledged a perfect man to be in Christ; not the body of a man only, nor, with the body, a sensitive soul without a rational, but very man; whom, not only as being a form of Truth, but for a certain great excellence of human nature and a more perfect participation of wisdom, I judged to be preferred before others. But Alypius imagined the Catholics to believe God to be so clothed with flesh, that besides God and flesh, there was no soul at all in Christ, and did not think that a human mind was ascribed to Him. And because he was well persuaded that the actions recorded of Him could only be performed by a vital and a rational creature, he moved the more slowly towards the Christian Faith. But understanding afterwards that this was the error of the Apollinarian heretics, he joyed in and was conformed to the Catholic Faith. But somewhat later, I confess, did I learn how in that saying, The Word was made flesh, the Catholic truth is distinguished from the falsehood of Photinus. For the rejection of heretics makes the tenets of Thy Church and sound doctrine to stand out more clearly. For there must also be heresies, that the approved may be made manifest among the weak.",but i thought otherwise conceiving only of my lord christ as of a man of excellent wisdom whom no one could be equalled unto especially for that being wonderfully born of a virgin he seemed in conformity therewith through the divine care for us to have attained that great eminence of authority for an ensample of despising things temporal for the obtaining of immortality but what mystery there lay in the word was made flesh i could not even imagine only i had learnt out of what is delivered to us in writing of him that he did eat and drink sleep walk rejoiced in spirit was sorrowful discoursed that flesh did not cleave by itself unto thy word but with the human soul and mind all know this who know the unchangeableness of thy word which i now knew as far as i could nor did i at all doubt thereof for now to move the limbs of the body by will now not now to be moved by some affection now not now to deliver wise sayings through human signs now to keep silence belong to soul and mind subject to variation and should these things be falsely written of him all the rest also would risk the charge nor would there remain in those books any saving faith for mankind since then they were written truly i acknowledged a perfect man to be in christ not the body of a man only nor with the body a sensitive soul without a rational but very man whom not only as being a form of truth but for a certain great excellence of human nature and a more perfect participation of wisdom i judged to be preferred before others but alypius imagined the catholics to believe god to be so clothed with flesh that besides god and flesh there was no soul at all in christ and did not think that a human mind was ascribed to him and because he was well persuaded that the actions recorded of him could only be performed by a vital and a rational creature he moved the more slowly towards the christian faith but understanding afterwards that this was the error of the apollinarian heretics he joyed in and was conformed to the catholic faith but somewhat later i confess did i learn how in that saying the word was made flesh the catholic truth is distinguished from the falsehood of photinus for the rejection of heretics makes the tenets of thy church and sound doctrine to stand out more clearly for there must also be heresies that the approved may be made manifest among the weak,445,2433,20.450000000000003,1.1345610299912927,2.2972972972972974,0.9608167261235021,18.250000000000004,0.9558253144745632,1.9729729729729732,0.80758616243961,154.97161008355837,0.4767007385790798,1.1581527159098626,0.5115506054958429,6.188933333333334,0.553599080990914,1.3207691133831836,0.5267736869893682,26.278999999999996,0.6799739588984346,1.8560566057661838,0.5492648674012106,149.08615514706418,0.746889769048911,1.776965276658601,0.613596099070434,5.001553480763615,0.3410496293806441,1.1250253228003866,0.371064447128783,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.223, 'compound': 0.9983}",0.9983,-0.044269011448227924,0.08635302788355229,-0.3014007967978695,0.22207482993197278,-0.1679852924094908,0.2457750471789925,-0.168017040654491,-0.732,-0.20027138266955055,-0.08659561385529824,0.03995218692477475,1.2725154751822163,0.17111017637981701,1.3614554468405025,0.3373326129920456,74.05525960227416,-0.6981065449839285,1.9267158377342586,-0.8878615266515413

Of these things I was assured, yet too unsure to enjoy Thee. I prated as one well skilled; but had I not sought Thy way in Christ our Saviour, I had proved to be, not skilled, but killed. For now I had begun to wish to seem wise, being filled with mine own punishment, yet I did not mourn, but rather scorn, puffed up with knowledge. For where was that charity building upon the foundation of humility, which is Christ Jesus? or when should these books teach me it? Upon these, I believe, Thou therefore willedst that I should fall, before I studied Thy Scriptures, that it might be imprinted on my memory how I was affected by them; and that afterwards when my spirits were tamed through Thy books, and my wounds touched by Thy healing fingers, I might discern and distinguish between presumption and confession; between those who saw whither they were to go, yet saw not the way, and the way that leadeth not to behold only but to dwell in the beatific country. For had I first been formed in Thy Holy Scriptures, and hadst Thou in the familiar use of them grown sweet unto me, and had I then fallen upon those other volumes, they might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid ground of piety, or, had I continued in that healthful frame which I had thence imbibed, I might have thought that it might have been obtained by the study of those books alone.",but having then read those books of the platonists and thence been taught to search for incorporeal truth i saw thy invisible things understood by those things which are made and though cast back i perceived what that was which through the darkness of my mind i was hindered from contemplating being assured that thou wert and wert infinite and yet not diffused in space finite or infinite and that thou truly art who art the same ever in no part nor motion varying and that all other things are from thee on this most sure ground alone that they are of these things i was assured yet too unsure to enjoy thee i prated as one well skilled but had i not sought thy way in christ our saviour i had proved to be not skilled but killed for now i had begun to wish to seem wise being filled with mine own punishment yet i did not mourn but rather scorn puffed up with knowledge for where was that charity building upon the foundation of humility which is christ jesus or when should these books teach me it upon these i believe thou therefore willedst that i should fall before i studied thy scriptures that it might be imprinted on my memory how i was affected by them and that afterwards when my spirits were tamed through thy books and my wounds touched by thy healing fingers i might discern and distinguish between presumption and confession between those who saw whither they were to go yet saw not the way and the way that leadeth not to behold only but to dwell in the beatific country for had i first been formed in thy holy scriptures and hadst thou in the familiar use of them grown sweet unto me and had i then fallen upon those other volumes they might perhaps have withdrawn me from the solid ground of piety or had i continued in that healthful frame which i had thence imbibed i might have thought that it might have been obtained by the study of those books alone,352,1925,7.500000000000002,0.21635090271325322,0.5472972972972973,0.1757352730671233,8.500000000000002,0.31325846644252897,0.6554054054054055,0.24817038059934018,14.56954743657041,-0.12917881304598136,-0.011985191196092792,-0.07640450276775655,1.372961111111111,-0.1062153490163635,0.08609288366651408,-0.05464428724231635,13.611999999999997,-0.0009617188701159219,0.5183229485690142,-0.014048750324837291,119.77081280877455,0.769624570062425,1.3089468498485615,0.6319563560219356,-1.0060984362263576,-0.6795045287089361,-0.7555585497606324,-0.6262168485766283,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9829}",0.9829,0.0627399558475387,0.06743643287065465,-0.14947621593870705,0.19342105263157897,-0.15204588758920737,0.09428226688990135,-0.11346613993784001,-0.9856,-0.33314365544763336,-0.216540274646444,-0.10903085542093412,0.7533670173884239,-0.07418167582676422,0.48754868655747685,0.05356159506182873,60.19822310087707,-0.5403104077601807,1.068607530291561,-0.6333153224743628
186,186,1481,1489,1497,"Most eagerly then did I seize that venerable writing of Thy Spirit; and chiefly the Apostle Paul. Whereupon those difficulties vanished away, wherein he once seemed to me to contradict himself, and the text of his discourse not to agree with the testimonies of the Law and the Prophets. And the face of that pure word appeared to me one and the same; and I learned to rejoice with trembling. So I began; and whatsoever truth I had read in those other books, I found here amid the praise of Thy Grace; that whoso sees, may not so glory as if he had not received, not only what he sees, but also that he sees (for what hath he, which he hath not received?), and that he may be not only admonished to behold Thee, who art ever the same, but also healed, to hold Thee; and that he who cannot see afar off, may yet walk on the way, whereby he may arrive, and behold, and hold Thee. For, though a man be delighted with the law of God after the inner man, what shall he do with that other law in his members which warreth against the law of his mind, and bringeth him into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members? For, Thou art righteous, O Lord, but we have sinned and committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and Thy hand is grown heavy upon us, and we are justly delivered over unto that ancient sinner, the king of death; because he persuaded our will to be like his will whereby he abode not in Thy truth. What shall wretched man do? who shall deliver him from the body of his death, but only Thy Grace, through Jesus Christ our Lord, whom Thou hast begotten co-eternal, and formedst in the beginning of Thy ways, in whom the prince of this world found nothing worthy of death, yet killed he Him; and the handwriting, which was contrary to us, was blotted out? This those writings contain not. Those pages present not the image of this piety, the tears of confession, Thy sacrifice, a troubled spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, the salvation of the people, the Bridal City, the earnest of the Holy Ghost, the Cup of our Redemption. No man sings there, Shall not my soul be submitted unto God? for of Him cometh my salvation. For He is my God and my salvation, my guardian, I shall no more be moved. No one there hears Him call, Come unto Me, all ye that labour. They scorn to learn of Him, because He is meek and lowly in heart; for these things hast Thou hid from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. For it is one thing, from the mountain's shaggy top to see the land of peace, and to find no way thither; and in vain to essay through ways unpassable, opposed and beset by fugitives and deserters, under their captain the lion and the dragon: and another to keep on the way that leads thither, guarded by the host of the heavenly General; where they spoil not who have deserted the heavenly army; for they avoid it, as very torment.

Thy words had stuck fast in my heart, and I was hedged round about on all sides by Thee. Of Thy eternal life I was now certain, though I saw it in a figure and as through a glass. Yet I had ceased to doubt that there was an incorruptible substance, whence was all other substance; nor did I now desire to be more certain of Thee, but more steadfast in Thee. But for my temporal life, all was wavering, and my heart had to be purged from the old leaven. The Way, the Saviour Himself, well pleased me, but as yet I shrunk from going through its straitness. And Thou didst put into my mind, and it seemed good in my eyes, to go to Simplicianus, who seemed to me a good servant of Thine; and Thy grace shone in him. I had heard also that from his very youth he had lived most devoted unto Thee. Now he was grown into years; and by reason of so great age spent in such zealous following of Thy ways, he seemed to me likely to have learned much experience; and so he had.

But I was displeased that I led a secular life; yea now that my desires no longer inflamed me, as of old, with hopes of honour and profit, a very grievous burden it was to undergo so heavy a bondage. For, in comparison of Thy sweetness, and the beauty of Thy house which I loved, those things delighted me no longer. But still I was enthralled with the love of woman; nor did the Apostle forbid me to marry, although he advised me to something better, chiefly wishing that all men were as himself was. But I being weak, chose the more indulgent place; and because of this alone, was tossed up and down in all beside, faint and wasted with withering cares, because in other matters I was constrained against my will to conform myself to a married life, to which I was given up and enthralled. I had heard from the mouth of the Truth, that there were some eunuchs which had made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake: but, saith He, let him who can receive it, receive it. Surely vain are all men who are ignorant of God, and could not out of the good things which are seen, find out Him who is good. But I was no longer in that vanity; I had surmounted it; and by the common witness of all Thy creatures had found Thee our Creator, and Thy Word, God with Thee, and together with Thee one God, by whom Thou createdst all things. There is yet another kind of ungodly, who knowing God, glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful. Into this also had I fallen, but Thy right hand upheld me, and took me thence, and Thou placedst me where I might recover. For Thou hast said unto man, Behold, the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and, Desire not to seem wise; because they who affirmed themselves to be wise, became fools.

To him I related the mazes of my wanderings.

199,199,1592,1598,1605,"Thus, I understood, by my own experience, what I had read, how the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. Myself verily either way; yet more myself, in that which I approved in myself, than in that which in myself I disapproved. For in this last, it was now for the more part not myself, because in much I rather endured against my will, than acted willingly. And yet it was through me that custom had obtained this power of warring against me, because I had come willingly, whither I willed not. And who has any right to speak against it, if just punishment follow the sinner? Nor had I now any longer my former plea, that I therefore as yet hesitated to be above the world and serve Thee, for that the truth was not altogether ascertained to me; for now it too was. But I still under service to the earth, refused to fight under Thy banner, and feared as much to be freed of all incumbrances, as we should fear to be encumbered with it. Thus with the baggage of this present world was I held down pleasantly, as in sleep: and the thoughts wherein I meditated on Thee were like the efforts of such as would awake, who yet overcome with a heavy drowsiness, are again drenched therein. And as no one would sleep for ever, and in all men's sober judgment waking is better, yet a man for the most part, feeling a heavy lethargy in all his limbs, defers to shake off sleep, and though half displeased, yet, even after it is time to rise, with pleasure yields to it, so was I assured that much better were it for me to give myself up to Thy charity, than to give myself over to mine own cupidity; but though the former course satisfied me and gained the mastery, the latter pleased me and held me mastered. Nor had I any thing to answer Thee calling to me, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. And when Thou didst on all sides show me that what Thou saidst was true, I, convicted by the truth, had nothing at all to answer, but only those dull and drowsy words, ""Anon, anon,"" ""presently,"" ""leave me but a little."" But ""presently, presently,"" had no present, and my ""little while"" went on for a long while; in vain I delighted in Thy law according to the inner man, when another law in my members rebelled against the law of my mind, and led me captive under the law of sin which was in my members. For the law of sin is the violence of custom, whereby the mind is drawn and holden, even against its will; but deservedly, for that it willingly fell into it. Who then should deliver me thus wretched from the body of this death, but Thy grace only, through Jesus Christ our Lord?",thus i understood by my own experience what i had read how the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh myself verily either way yet more myself in that which i approved in myself than in that which in myself i disapproved for in this last it was now for the more part not myself because in much i rather endured against my will than acted willingly and yet it was through me that custom had obtained this power of warring against me because i had come willingly whither i willed not and who has any right to speak against it if just punishment follow the sinner nor had i now any longer my former plea that i therefore as yet hesitated to be above the world and serve thee for that the truth was not altogether ascertained to me for now it too was but i still under service to the earth refused to fight under thy banner and feared as much to be freed of all incumbrances as we should fear to be encumbered with it thus with the baggage of this present world was i held down pleasantly as in sleep and the thoughts wherein i meditated on thee were like the efforts of such as would awake who yet overcome with a heavy drowsiness are again drenched therein and as no one would sleep for ever and in all men own sober judgment waking is better yet a man for the most part feeling a heavy lethargy in all his limbs defers to shake off sleep and though half displeased yet even after it is time to rise with pleasure yields to it so was i assured that much better were it for me to give myself up to thy charity than to give myself over to mine own cupidity but though the former course satisfied me and gained the mastery the latter pleased me and held me mastered nor had i any thing to answer thee calling to me awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light and when thou didst on all sides show me that what thou saidst was true i convicted by the truth had nothing at all to answer but only those dull and drowsy words anon anon presently leave me but a little but presently presently had no present and my little while went on for a long while in vain i delighted in thy law according to the inner man when another law in my members rebelled against the law of my mind and led me captive under the law of sin which was in my members for the law of sin is the violence of custom whereby the mind is drawn and holden even against its will but deservedly for that it willingly fell into it who then should deliver me thus wretched from the body of this death but thy grace only through jesus christ our lord,501,2649,3.549999999999999,-0.3134174681826899,0.013513513513513284,-0.27722348882241654,5.049999999999999,-0.2227840587745291,0.1891891891891889,-0.2185058092201873,41.570787680222885,-0.047071614619674414,0.21304835996627267,0.0032736223818351584,5.114583333333334,0.30971295843444663,1.0453367923088663,0.31186511744135503,13.311000000000007,-0.40523060363860564,0.4865350089766613,-0.34848587184458535,-24.66607362271941,-0.922549252236252,-0.9969830479140509,-0.7346158064324685,-0.15831286358480579,-0.4954675789265427,-0.4901750193349178,-0.446376703610459,"{'neg': 0.128, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': -0.8946}",-0.8946,-0.8296450926517366,-2.238791303279695,-1.416428209630167,0.17227633477633478,-0.21701630753671763,-0.017510048054743172,-0.3358204228007511,-0.9793,-0.23590320892016092,-0.21331215412994467,0.0,1.249502313756958,0.0464524799441762,1.3227163211759783,0.19311974537267562,80.58124756466614,-0.8893090014291132,2.330842974458983,-1.1962965769244283

What he would with us, I know not, but we sat down to converse, and it happened that upon a table for some game, before us, he observed a book, took, opened it, and contrary to his expectation, found it the Apostle Paul; for he thought it some of those books which I was wearing myself in teaching. Whereat smiling, and looking at me, he expressed his joy and wonder that he had on a sudden found this book, and this only before my eyes. For he was a Christian, and baptised, and often bowed himself before Thee our God in the Church, in frequent and continued prayers. When then I had told him that I bestowed very great pains upon those Scriptures, a conversation arose (suggested by his account) on Antony the Egyptian monk: whose name was in high reputation among Thy servants, though to that hour unknown to us. Which when he discovered, he dwelt the more upon that subject, informing and wondering at our ignorance of one so eminent. But we stood amazed, hearing Thy wonderful works most fully attested, in times so recent, and almost in our own, wrought in the true Faith and Church Catholic.

202,202,1621,1629,1637,"Thence his discourse turned to the flocks in the monasteries, and their holy ways, a sweet-smelling savour unto Thee, and the fruitful deserts of the wilderness, whereof we knew nothing. And there was a monastery at Milan, full of good brethren, without the city walls, under the fostering care of Ambrose, and we knew it not. He went on with his discourse, and we listened in intent silence. He told us then how one afternoon at Triers, when the Emperor was taken up with the Circensian games, he and three others, his companions, went out to walk in gardens near the city walls, and there as they happened to walk in pairs, one went apart with him, and the other two wandered by themselves; and these, in their wanderings, lighted upon a certain cottage, inhabited by certain of Thy servants, poor in spirit, of whom is the kingdom of heaven, and there they found a little book containing the life of Antony. This one of them began to read, admire, and kindle at it; and as he read, to meditate on taking up such a life, and giving over his secular service to serve Thee. And these two were of those whom they style agents for the public affairs. Then suddenly, filled with a holy love, and a sober shame, in anger with himself cast his eyes upon his friend, saying, ""Tell me, I pray thee, what would we attain by all these labours of ours? what aim we at? what serve we for? Can our hopes in court rise higher than to be the Emperor's favourites? and in this, what is there not brittle, and full of perils? and by how many perils arrive we at a greater peril? and when arrive we thither? But a friend of God, if I wish it, I become now at once."" So spake he. And in pain with the travail of a new life, he turned his eyes again upon the book, and read on, and was changed inwardly, where Thou sawest, and his mind was stripped of the world, as soon appeared. For as he read, and rolled up and down the waves of his heart, he stormed at himself a while, then discerned, and determined on a better course; and now being Thine, said to his friend, ""Now have I broken loose from those our hopes, and am resolved to serve God; and this, from this hour, in this place, I begin upon. If thou likest not to imitate me, oppose not."" The other answered, he would cleave to him, to partake so glorious a reward, so glorious a service. Thus both being now Thine, were building the tower at the necessary cost, the forsaking all that they had, and following Thee. Then Pontitianus and the other with him, that had walked in other parts of the garden, came in search of them to the same place; and finding them, reminded them to return, for the day was now far spent. But they relating their resolution and purpose, and how that will was begun and settled in them, begged them, if they would not join, not to molest them. But the others, though nothing altered from their former selves, did yet bewail themselves (as he affirmed), and piously congratulated them, recommending themselves to their prayers; and so, with hearts lingering on the earth, went away to the palace. But the other two, fixing their heart on heaven, remained in the cottage. And both had affianced brides, who when they heard hereof, also dedicated their virginity unto God.",thence his discourse turned to the flocks in the monasteries and their holy ways a sweet smelling savour unto thee and the fruitful deserts of the wilderness whereof we knew nothing and there was a monastery at milan full of good brethren without the city walls under the fostering care of ambrose and we knew it not he went on with his discourse and we listened in intent silence he told us then how one afternoon at triers when the emperor was taken up with the circensian games he and three others his companions went out to walk in gardens near the city walls and there as they happened to walk in pairs one went apart with him and the other two wandered by themselves and these in their wanderings lighted upon a certain cottage inhabited by certain of thy servants poor in spirit of whom is the kingdom of heaven and there they found a little book containing the life of antony this one of them began to read admire and kindle at it and as he read to meditate on taking up such a life and giving over his secular service to serve thee and these two were of those whom they style agents for the public affairs then suddenly filled with a holy love and a sober shame in anger with himself cast his eyes upon his friend saying tell me i pray thee what would we attain by all these labours of ours what aim we at what serve we for can our hopes in court rise higher than to be the emperor own favourites and in this what is there not brittle and full of perils and by how many perils arrive we at a greater peril and when arrive we thither but a friend of god if i wish it i become now at once so spake he and in pain with the travail of a new life he turned his eyes again upon the book and read on and was changed inwardly where thou sawest and his mind was stripped of the world as soon appeared for as he read and rolled up and down the waves of his heart he stormed at himself a while then discerned and determined on a better course and now being thine said to his friend now have i broken loose from those our hopes and am resolved to serve god and this from this hour in this place i begin upon if thou likest not to imitate me oppose not the other answered he would cleave to him to partake so glorious a reward so glorious a service thus both being now thine were building the tower at the necessary cost the forsaking all that they had and following thee then pontitianus and the other with him that had walked in other parts of the garden came in search of them to the same place and finding them reminded them to return for the day was now far spent but they relating their resolution and purpose and how that will was begun and settled in them begged them if they would not join not to molest them but the others though nothing altered from their former selves did yet bewail themselves as he affirmed and piously congratulated them recommending themselves to their prayers and so with hearts lingering on the earth went away to the palace but the other two fixing their heart on heaven remained in the cottage and both had affianced brides who when they heard hereof also dedicated their virginity unto god,599,3236,10.649999999999995,0.08495419147596008,0.972972972972972,0.06338939719358601,13.249999999999998,0.23600161444742537,1.2972972972972971,0.1809109158545853,13.522172092665825,-0.1663304068179942,-0.020714219600414342,-0.11245699749183426,2.89975,-0.04420300877595735,0.4775174729131696,0.0,26.331000000000007,0.17568418784817066,1.8615482099482525,0.1320840607742433,103.68849498536859,0.043406548452913654,1.0521932018675,0.04547444788312711,6.15833548745838,0.27166814466553846,1.4871344489477794,0.3032651476735039,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.9962}",0.9962,-0.15738064834889687,0.08377349219997533,-0.46198956296109306,0.0894432342349009,-0.27848501323454866,-0.4554494013704813,-0.5461904648136366,0.9889,0.17886920344128246,0.7951936872309898,0.4650635876296203,0.5027049064481309,-0.5178206198351213,0.06559748934416387,-0.45967141126205696,94.6844081196726,-0.9843020443606479,3.2041927150206866,-1.3495330181129448

""What ails us?"" I exclaim: ""what is it? what heardest thou? The unlearned start up and take heaven by force, and we with our learning, and without heart, lo, where we wallow in flesh and blood! Are we ashamed to follow, because others are gone before, and not ashamed not even to follow?"" Some such words I uttered, and my fever of mind tore me away from him, while he, gazing on me in astonishment, kept silence. For it was not my wonted tone; and my forehead, cheeks, eyes, colour, tone of voice, spake my mind more than the words I uttered. A little garden there was to our lodging, which we had the use of, as of the whole house; for the master of the house, our host, was not living there. Thither had the tumult of my breast hurried me, where no man might hinder the hot contention wherein I had engaged with myself, until it should end as Thou knewest, I knew not. Only I was healthfully distracted and dying, to live; knowing what evil thing I was, and not knowing what good thing I was shortly to become. I retired then into the garden, and Alypius, on my steps. For his presence did not lessen my privacy; or how could he forsake me so disturbed? We sate down as far removed as might be from the house. I was troubled in spirit, most vehemently indignant that I entered not into Thy will and covenant, O my God, which all my bones cried out unto me to enter, and praised it to the skies. And therein we enter not by ships, or chariots, or feet, no, move not so far as I had come from the house to that place where we were sitting. For, not to go only, but to go in thither was nothing else but to will to go, but to will resolutely and thoroughly; not to turn and toss, this way and that, a maimed and half-divided will, struggling, with one part sinking as another rose.",then in this great contention of my inward dwelling which i had strongly raised against my soul in the chamber of my heart troubled in mind and countenance i turned upon alypius what ails us i exclaim what is it what heardest thou the unlearned start up and take heaven by force and we with our learning and without heart lo where we wallow in flesh and blood are we ashamed to follow because others are gone before and not ashamed not even to follow some such words i uttered and my fever of mind tore me away from him while he gazing on me in astonishment kept silence for it was not my wonted tone and my forehead cheeks eyes colour tone of voice spake my mind more than the words i uttered a little garden there was to our lodging which we had the use of as of the whole house for the master of the house our host was not living there thither had the tumult of my breast hurried me where no man might hinder the hot contention wherein i had engaged with myself until it should end as thou knewest i knew not only i was healthfully distracted and dying to live knowing what evil thing i was and not knowing what good thing i was shortly to become i retired then into the garden and alypius on my steps for his presence did not lessen my privacy or how could he forsake me so disturbed we sate down as far removed as might be from the house i was troubled in spirit most vehemently indignant that i entered not into thy will and covenant o my god which all my bones cried out unto me to enter and praised it to the skies and therein we enter not by ships or chariots or feet no move not so far as i had come from the house to that place where we were sitting for not to go only but to go in thither was nothing else but to will to go but to will resolutely and thoroughly not to turn and toss this way and that a maimed and half divided will struggling with one part sinking as another rose,376,1964,-4.949999999999999,-1.0678088364505642,-1.135135135135135,-0.9222377987044432,-5.950000000000001,-1.2098413856611276,-1.2972972972972976,-1.077833438606236,-144.30869988214175,-0.9686958047317875,-1.3361071898138142,-0.8910850814600952,-4.750000000000001,-1.1963241788791474,-1.4836575614222496,-1.0152308381364838,-3.8289999999999984,-1.6329897677993637,-1.3235822156510717,-1.3641669105091274,6.2776258131865115,-0.6361139548981509,-0.5029679563433906,-0.5032953010987624,-2.653580471157052,-0.9834886468322668,-1.2712722076146623,-0.923268869572159,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.038, 'compound': -0.8907}",-0.8907,-0.9433393045964081,-2.2340007370101955,-1.5778440790877757,0.08618927368927369,-0.25323771789144695,-0.4726531202673019,-0.4597843086770605,-0.9943,-0.3152458708571486,-0.22099815535970488,-0.08896296357421318,0.30473063098801184,-0.5276366973858339,-0.26766182230239516,-0.47102734621704995,59.87140938048098,-0.9444643921507345,1.0483693236281186,-1.2852695745852667

208,208,1675,1684,1693,"Whence is this monstrousness? and to what end? Let Thy mercy gleam that I may ask, if so be the secret penalties of men, and those darkest pangs of the sons of Adam, may perhaps answer me. Whence is this monstrousness? and to what end? The mind commands the body, and it obeys instantly; the mind commands itself, and is resisted. The mind commands the hand to be moved; and such readiness is there, that command is scarce distinct from obedience. Yet the mind is mind, the hand is body. The mind commands the mind, its own self, to will, and yet it doth not. Whence this monstrousness? and to what end? It commands itself, I say, to will, and would not command, unless it willed, and what it commands is not done. But it willeth not entirely: therefore doth it not command entirely. For so far forth it commandeth, as it willeth: and, so far forth is the thing commanded, not done, as it willeth not. For the will commandeth that there be a will; not another, but itself.

And she smiled on me with a persuasive mockery, as would she say, ""Canst not thou what these youths, what these maidens can? or can they either in themselves, and not rather in the Lord their God? The Lord their God gave me unto them. Why standest thou in thyself, and so standest not? cast thyself upon Him, fear not He will not withdraw Himself that thou shouldest fall; cast thyself fearlessly upon Him, He will receive, and will heal thee."" And I blushed exceedingly, for that I yet heard the muttering of those toys, and hung in suspense. And she again seemed to say, ""Stop thine ears against those thy unclean members on the earth, that they may be mortified. They tell thee of delights, but not as doth the law of the Lord thy God.""

Thus was it then with me, and he perceived something of it; for something I suppose I had spoken, wherein the tones of my voice appeared choked with weeping, and so had risen up. He then remained where we were sitting, most extremely astonished. I cast myself down I know not how, under a certain fig-tree, giving full vent to my tears; and the floods of mine eyes gushed out an acceptable sacrifice to Thee. And, not indeed in these words, yet to this purpose, spake I much unto Thee: and Thou, O Lord, how long? how long, Lord, wilt Thou be angry for ever?

Instantly, my countenance altered, I began to think most intently whether children were wont in any kind of play to sing such words: nor could I remember ever to have heard the like. So checking the torrent of my tears, I arose; interpreting it to be no other than a command from God to open the book, and read the first chapter I should find. For I had heard of Antony, that coming in during the reading of the Gospel, he received the admonition, as if what was being read was spoken to him: Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me: and by such oracle he was forthwith converted unto Thee. Eagerly then I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I laid the volume of the Apostle when I arose thence. I seized, opened, and in silence read that section on which my eyes first fell: Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, in concupiscence.

Let my heart and my tongue praise Thee; yea, let all my bones say, O Lord, who is like unto Thee? Let them say, and answer Thou me, and say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. Who am I, and what am I? What evil have not been either my deeds, or if not my deeds, my words, or if not my words, my will? But Thou, O Lord, are good and merciful, and Thy right hand had respect unto the depth of my death, and from the bottom of my heart emptied that abyss of corruption. And this Thy whole gift was, to nill what I willed, and to will what Thou willedst. But where through all those years, and out of what low and deep recess was my free-will called forth in a moment, whereby to submit my neck to Thy easy yoke, and my shoulders unto Thy light burden, O Christ Jesus, my Helper and my Redeemer? How sweet did it at once become to me, to want the sweetnesses of those toys! and what I feared to be parted from, was now a joy to part with. For Thou didst cast them forth from me, Thou true and highest sweetness.

Whom, not long after our conversion and regeneration by Thy Baptism, being also a faithful member of the Church Catholic, and serving Thee in perfect chastity and continence amongst his people in Africa, his whole house having through him first been made Christian, didst Thou release from the flesh; and now he lives in Abraham's bosom. Whatever that be, which is signified by that bosom, there lives my Nebridius, my sweet friend, and Thy child, O Lord, adopted of a freed man: there he liveth. For what other place is there for such a soul? There he liveth, whereof he asked much of me, a poor inexperienced man.

Who being an officer of Court, was before us converted to Thee and baptised: and quitting his secular warfare, girded himself to Thine. We were together, about to dwell together in our devout purpose. We sought where we might serve Thee most usefully, and were together returning to Africa: whitherward being as far as Ostia, my mother departed this life. Much I omit, as hastening much. Receive my confessions and thanksgivings, O my God, for innumerable things whereof I am silent. But I will not omit whatsoever my soul would bring forth concerning that Thy handmaid, who brought me forth, both in the flesh, that I might be born to this temporal light, and in heart, that I might be born to Light eternal. Not her gifts, but Thine in her, would I speak of; for neither did she make nor educate herself. Thou createdst her; nor did her father and mother know what a one should come from them. And the sceptre of Thy Christ, the discipline of Thine only Son, in a Christian house, a good member of Thy Church, educated her in Thy fear. Yet for her good discipline was she wont to commend not so much her mother's diligence, as that of a certain decrepit maid-servant, who had carried her father when a child, as little ones used to be carried at the backs of elder girls. For which reason, and for her great age, and excellent conversation, was she, in that Christian family, well respected by its heads. Whence also the charge of her master's daughters was entrusted to her, to which she gave diligent heed, restraining them earnestly, when necessary, with a holy severity, and teaching them with a grave discretion. For, except at those hours wherein they were most temporately fed at their parents' table, she would not suffer them, though parched with thirst, to drink even water; preventing an evil custom, and adding this wholesome advice: ""Ye drink water now, because you have not wine in your power; but when you come to be married, and be made mistresses of cellars and cupboards, you will scorn water, but the custom of drinking will abide.""

235,235,1918,1925,1933,"And yet (as Thy handmaid told me her son) there had crept upon her a love of wine. For when (as the manner was) she, as though a sober maiden, was bidden by her parents to draw wine out of the hogshed, holding the vessel under the opening, before she poured the wine into the flagon, she sipped a little with the tip of her lips; for more her instinctive feelings refused. For this she did, not out of any desire of drink, but out of the exuberance of youth, whereby it boils over in mirthful freaks, which in youthful spirits are wont to be kept under by the gravity of their elders. And thus by adding to that little, daily littles (for whoso despiseth little things shall fall by little and little), she had fallen into such a habit as greedily to drink off her little cup brim-full almost of wine. Where was then that discreet old woman, and that her earnest countermanding? Would aught avail against a secret disease, if Thy healing hand, O Lord, watched not over us? Father, mother, and governors absent, Thou present, who createdst, who callest, who also by those set over us, workest something towards the salvation of our souls, what didst Thou then, O my God? how didst Thou cure her? how heal her? didst Thou not out of another soul bring forth a hard and a sharp taunt, like a lancet out of Thy secret store, and with one touch remove all that foul stuff? For a maid-servant with whom she used to go to the cellar, falling to words (as it happens) with her little mistress, when alone with her, taunted her with this fault, with most bitter insult, calling her wine-bibber. With which taunt she, stung to the quick, saw the foulness of her fault, and instantly condemned and forsook it. As flattering friends pervert, so reproachful enemies mostly correct. Yet not what by them Thou doest, but what themselves purposed, dost Thou repay them. For she in her anger sought to vex her young mistress, not to amend her; and did it in private, either for that the time and place of the quarrel so found them; or lest herself also should have anger, for discovering it thus late. But Thou, Lord, Governor of all in heaven and earth, who turnest to Thy purposes the deepest currents, and the ruled turbulence of the tide of times, didst by the very unhealthiness of one soul heal another; lest any, when he observes this, should ascribe it to his own power, even when another, whom he wished to be reformed, is reformed through words of his.",and yet as thy handmaid told me her son there had crept upon her a love of wine for when as the manner was she as though a sober maiden was bidden by her parents to draw wine out of the hogshed holding the vessel under the opening before she poured the wine into the flagon she sipped a little with the tip of her lips for more her instinctive feelings refused for this she did not out of any desire of drink but out of the exuberance of youth whereby it boils over in mirthful freaks which in youthful spirits are will not to be kept under by the gravity of their elders and thus by adding to that little daily littles for whoso despiseth little things shall fall by little and little she had fallen into such a habit as greedily to drink off her little cup brim full almost of wine where was then that discreet old woman and that her earnest countermanding would aught avail against a secret disease if thy healing hand o lord watched not over us father mother and governors absent thou present who createdst who callest who also by those set over us workest something towards the salvation of our souls what didst thou then o my god how didst thou cure her how heal her didst thou not out of another soul bring forth a hard and a sharp taunt like a lancet out of thy secret store and with one touch remove all that foul stuff for a maid servant with whom she used to go to the cellar falling to words as it happens with her little mistress when alone with her taunted her with this fault with most bitter insult calling her wine bibber with which taunt she stung to the quick saw the foulness of her fault and instantly condemned and forsook it as flattering friends pervert so reproachful enemies mostly correct yet not what by them thou doest but what themselves purposed dost thou repay them for she in her anger sought to vex her young mistress not to amend her and did it in private either for that the time and place of the quarrel so found them or lest herself also should have anger for discovering it thus late but thou lord governor of all in heaven and earth who turnest to thy purposes the deepest currents and the ruled turbulence of the tide of times didst by the very unhealthiness of one soul heal another lest any when he observes this should ascribe it to his own power even when another whom he wished to be reformed is reformed through words of his,450,2445,-3.950000000000002,-0.9043775115230319,-1.0000000000000002,-0.7825019166472592,-4.950000000000002,-1.026009935796459,-1.1621621621621627,-0.9177906126063686,-140.66186166091563,-0.8280798454965943,-1.305713735734234,-0.7546291285995496,-5.772222222222221,-1.2091272802483752,-1.7457258253217354,-1.0265127272911319,5.744999999999998,-0.8663102782487742,-0.31249339951420446,-0.729920518382354,-6.207614569596173,-0.7685821197844185,-0.7022943873591048,-0.6102744448247199,-1.7715511989784092,-0.7575822579113947,-0.9951693229427143,-0.7025140821213173,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': -0.9498}",-0.9498,-0.8930049936081227,-2.306596241248004,-1.5063825998026419,-0.017607526881720435,-0.3380278450914208,-1.0214277456426486,-0.7499694104916546,-0.9953,-0.26547731597967167,-0.22151055544168888,-0.03315996898572198,-0.08919941969184939,-0.8715913480551706,-0.9307826101994597,-0.8689384894704705,71.0230980681344,-0.9925904460287326,1.7389467572608692,-1.3629033148795582

And she so endured the wronging of her bed as never to have any quarrel with her husband thereon. For she looked for Thy mercy upon him, that believing in Thee, he might be made chaste. But besides this, he was fervid, as in his affections, so in anger: but she had learnt not to resist an angry husband, not in deed only, but not even in word. Only when he was smoothed and tranquil, and in a temper to receive it, she would give an account of her actions, if haply he had overhastily taken offence. In a word, while many matrons, who had milder husbands, yet bore even in their faces marks of shame, would in familiar talk blame their husbands' lives, she would blame their tongues, giving them, as in jest, earnest advice: ""That from the time they heard the marriage writings read to them, they should account them as indentures, whereby they were made servants; and so, remembering their condition, ought not to set themselves up against their lords."" And when they, knowing what a choleric husband she endured, marvelled that it had never been heard, nor by any token perceived, that Patricius had beaten his wife, or that there had been any domestic difference between them, even for one day, and confidentially asking the reason, she taught them her practice above mentioned.

But when she breathed her last, the boy Adeodatus burst out into a loud lament; then, checked by us all, held his peace.

For what is it to hear from Thee of themselves, but to know themselves? and who knoweth and saith, ""It is false,"" unless himself lieth? But because charity believeth all things (that is, among those whom knitting unto itself it maketh one), I also, O Lord, will in such wise confess unto Thee, that men may hear, to whom I cannot demonstrate whether I confess truly; yet they believe me, whose ears charity openeth unto me.",what then have i to do with men that they should hear my confessions—as if they could heal all my infirmities—a race curious to know the lives of others slothful to amend their own why seek they to hear from me what i am who will not hear from thee what themselves are and how know they when from myself they hear of myself whether i say true seeing no man knows what is in man but the spirit of man which is in him but if they hear from thee of themselves they cannot say the lord lieth for what is it to hear from thee of themselves but to know themselves and who knoweth and saith it is false unless himself lieth but because charity believeth all things that is among those whom knitting unto itself it maketh one i also o lord will in such wise confess unto thee that men may hear to whom i cannot demonstrate whether i confess truly yet they believe me whose ears charity openeth unto me,175,927,2.1499999999999995,-0.11970837086713496,-0.1756756756756758,-0.11159972246127145,2.6499999999999995,-0.02986295183929045,-0.1351351351351354,-0.05054956902479136,-32.44232660241278,-0.5769354641532072,-0.4037912292271496,-0.510914645206778,2.6875,0.649165040589269,0.4231027010529529,0.6109848895763891,8.672,0.36262632726969507,-0.003379448727426341,0.2867345752076784,39.56534573133608,0.27360370702728226,0.028469341178359617,0.23137794351604157,0.3798824890329826,-0.3154476146407006,-0.32170295830255874,-0.27046194023141645,"{'neg': 0.009, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9607}",0.9607,0.5885433076569169,0.040167055644269686,0.5970262114437759,0.19166666666666665,0.020389790561912733,0.0850068123926308,0.4766764447375937,0.9861,0.6371629484683087,0.7937589670014347,0.9789254716373526,0.22223141320143755,-0.37096922754610323,-0.40653659513353385,-0.2897833016511901,33.99948276845194,0.2575265871456725,-0.5537708708565819,0.6537021050653519

All these doth that great harbour of the memory receive in her numberless secret and inexpressible windings, to be forthcoming, and brought out at need; each entering in by his own gate, and there laid up. Nor yet do the things themselves enter in; only the images of the things perceived are there in readiness, for thought to recall. Which images, how they are formed, who can tell, though it doth plainly appear by which sense each hath been brought in and stored up? For even while I dwell in darkness and silence, in my memory I can produce colours, if I will, and discern betwixt black and white, and what others I will: nor yet do sounds break in and disturb the image drawn in by my eyes, which I am reviewing, though they also are there, lying dormant, and laid up, as it were, apart. For these too I call for, and forthwith they appear.

Does the memory perchance not belong to the mind? Who will say so? The memory then is, as it were, the belly of the mind, and joy and sadness, like sweet and bitter food; which, when committed to the memory, are as it were passed into the belly, where they may be stowed, but cannot taste.

Certainly then we had forgotten it. Or, had not the whole escaped us, but by the part whereof we had hold, was the lost part sought for; in that the memory felt that it did not carry on together all which it was wont, and maimed, as it were, by the curtailment of its ancient habit, demanded the restoration of what it missed? For instance, if we see or think of some one known to us, and having forgotten his name, try to recover it; whatever else occurs, connects itself not therewith; because it was not wont to be thought upon together with him, and therefore is rejected, until that present itself, whereon the knowledge reposes equably as its wonted object. And whence does that present itself, but out of the memory itself? for even when we recognise it, on being reminded by another, it is thence it comes.

For my body liveth by my soul; and my soul by Thee. How then do I seek a happy life, seeing I have it not, until I can say, where I ought to say it, ""It is enough""? How seek I it?

Truly we have it, how, I know not. Yea, there is another way, wherein when one hath it, then is he happy; and there are, who are blessed, in hope. These have it in a lower kind, than they who have it in very deed; yet are they better off than such as are happy neither in deed nor in hope. Yet even these, had they it not in some sort, would not so will to be happy, which that they do will, is most certain. They have known it then, I know not how, and so have it by some sort of knowledge, what, I know not, and am perplexed whether it be in the memory, which if it be, then we have been happy once; whether all severally, or in that man who first sinned, in whom also we all died, and from whom we are all born with misery, I now enquire not; but only, whether the happy life be in the memory? For neither should we love it, did we not know it. We hear the name, and we all confess that we desire the thing; for we are not delighted with the mere sound. For when a Greek hears it in Latin, he is not delighted, not knowing what is spoken; but we Latins are delighted, as would he too, if he heard it in Greek; because the thing itself is neither Greek nor Latin, which Greeks and Latins, and men of all other tongues, long for so earnestly.

For I ask any one, had he rather joy in truth, or in falsehood? They will as little hesitate to say ""in the truth,"" as to say ""that they desire to be happy,"" for a happy life is joy in the truth: for this is a joying in Thee, Who art the Truth, O God my light, health of my countenance, my God. This is the happy life which all desire; this life which alone is happy, all desire; to joy in the truth all desire. I have met with many that would deceive; who would be deceived, no one. Where then did they know this happy life, save where they know the truth also? For they love it also, since they would not be deceived.

But while I am passing from the discomfort of emptiness to the content of replenishing, in the very passage the snare of concupiscence besets me. For that passing, is pleasure, nor is there any other way to pass thither, whither we needs must pass. And health being the cause of eating and drinking, there joineth itself as an attendant a dangerous pleasure, which mostly endeavours to go before it, so that I may for her sake do what I say I do, or wish to do, for health's sake. Nor have each the same measure; for what is enough for health, is too little for pleasure. And oft it is uncertain, whether it be the necessary care of the body which is yet asking for sustenance, or whether a voluptuous deceivableness of greediness is proffering its services. In this uncertainty the unhappy soul rejoiceth, and therein prepares an excuse to shield itself, glad that it appeareth not what sufficeth for the moderation of health, that under the cloak of health, it may disguise the matter of gratification.

Drunkenness is far from me; Thou wilt have mercy, that it come not near me. But full feeding sometimes creepeth upon Thy servant; Thou wilt have mercy, that it may be far from me. For no one can be continent unless Thou give it. Many things Thou givest us, praying for them; and what good soever we have received before we prayed, from Thee we received it; yea to the end we might afterwards know this, did we before receive it. Drunkard was I never, but drunkards have I known made sober by Thee. From Thee then it was, that they who never were such, should not so be, as from Thee it was, that they who have been, should not ever so be; and from Thee it was, that both might know from Whom it was. I heard another voice of Thine, Go not after thy lusts, and from thy pleasure turn away. Yea by Thy favour have I heard that which I have much loved; neither if we eat, shall we abound; neither if we eat not, shall we lack; which is to say, neither shall the one make me plenteous, nor the other miserable. I heard also another, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content; I know how to abound, and how to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me. Behold a soldier of the heavenly camp, not the dust which we are. But remember, Lord, that we are dust, and that of dust Thou hast made man; and he was lost and is found. Nor could he of himself do this, because he whom I so loved, saying this through the in-breathing of Thy inspiration, was of the same dust. I can do all things (saith he) through Him that strengtheneth me. Strengthen me, that I can. Give what Thou enjoinest, and enjoin what Thou wilt. He confesses to have received, and when he glorieth, in the Lord he glorieth. Another have I heard begging that he might receive.

For at one time I seem to myself to give them more honour than is seemly, feeling our minds to be more holily and fervently raised unto a flame of devotion, by the holy words themselves when thus sung, than when not; and that the several affections of our spirit, by a sweet variety, have their own proper measures in the voice and singing, by some hidden correspondence wherewith they are stirred up.

Thus in these things I unawares sin, but afterwards am aware of it.",the delights of the ear had more firmly entangled and subdued me but thou didst loosen and free me now in those melodies which thy words breathe soul into when sung with a sweet and attuned voice i do a little repose yet not so as to be held thereby but that i can disengage myself when i will but with the words which are their life and whereby they find admission into me themselves seek in my affections a place of some estimation and i can scarcely assign them one suitable for at one time i seem to myself to give them more honour than is seemly feeling our minds to be more holily and fervently raised unto a flame of devotion by the holy words themselves when thus sung than when not and that the several affections of our spirit by a sweet variety have their own proper measures in the voice and singing by some hidden correspondence wherewith they are stirred up but this contentment of the flesh to which the soul must not be given over to be enervated doth oft beguile me the sense not so waiting upon reason as patiently to follow her but having been admitted merely for her sake it strives even to run before her and lead her thus in these things i unawares sin but afterwards am aware of it,230,1232,7.1499999999999995,0.5806861574539751,0.4999999999999998,0.4872465956871791,8.15,0.743340231004157,0.608108108108108,0.6225976130567039,108.72807966652384,0.722480108539591,0.7727502020206535,0.7500587969119441,-0.8187500000000003,-0.5980957800623763,-0.4757985655424997,-0.4880814943974041,11.311999999999998,0.35020998977752166,0.27542507128524624,0.2764629853645022,25.909958874793467,-0.21922560772136748,-0.1895384378314093,-0.16662302630283243,2.347384223814533,0.26623810869353687,0.29418692393280493,0.29795893901523746,"{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.987}",0.987,0.354936305741941,0.07247266920525726,0.26536572776109374,0.1963888888888889,-0.05587525481664865,0.10997324408111696,0.21566751965510722,0.9982,0.4882086252873911,0.7999590079934412,0.8119104294915578,0.5407104350534083,-0.0023446985328988965,0.12957396443074548,0.1366677071822667,43.33632413196061,0.056431949633478404,0.024420659381041834,0.3293096480653904

Yet again, when I remember the tears I shed at the Psalmody of Thy Church, in the beginning of my recovered faith; and how at this time I am moved, not with the singing, but with the things sung, when they are sung with a clear voice and modulation most suitable, I acknowledge the great use of this institution. Thus I fluctuate between peril of pleasure and approved wholesomeness; inclined the rather (though not as pronouncing an irrevocable opinion) to approve of the usage of singing in the church; that so by the delight of the ears the weaker minds may rise to the feeling of devotion. Yet when it befalls me to be more moved with the voice than the words sung, I confess to have sinned penally, and then had rather not hear music. See now my state; weep with me, and weep for me, ye, whoso regulate your feelings within, as that good action ensues. For you who do not act, these things touch not you.

For besides that concupiscence of the flesh which consisteth in the delight of all senses and pleasures, wherein its slaves, who go far from Thee, waste and perish, the soul hath, through the same senses of the body, a certain vain and curious desire, veiled under the title of knowledge and learning, not of delighting in the flesh, but of making experiments through the flesh. The seat whereof being in the appetite of knowledge, and sight being the sense chiefly used for attaining knowledge, it is in Divine language called The lust of the eyes. For, to see, belongeth properly to the eyes; yet we use this word of the other senses also, when we employ them in seeking knowledge. For we do not say, hark how it flashes, or smell how it glows, or taste how it shines, or feel how it gleams; for all these are said to be seen. And yet we say not only, see how it shineth, which the eyes alone can perceive; but also, see how it soundeth, see how it smelleth, see how it tasteth, see how hard it is. And so the general experience of the senses, as was said, is called The lust of the eyes, because the office of seeing, wherein the eyes hold the prerogative, the other senses by way of similitude take to themselves, when they make search after any knowledge.",to this is added another form of temptation more manifoldly dangerous for besides that concupiscence of the flesh which consisteth in the delight of all senses and pleasures wherein its slaves who go far from thee waste and perish the soul hath through the same senses of the body a certain vain and curious desire veiled under the title of knowledge and learning not of delighting in the flesh but of making experiments through the flesh the seat whereof being in the appetite of knowledge and sight being the sense chiefly used for attaining knowledge it is in divine language called the lust of the eyes for to see belongeth properly to the eyes yet we use this word of the other senses also when we employ them in seeking knowledge for we do not say hark how it flashes or smell how it glows or taste how it shines or feel how it gleams for all these are said to be seen and yet we say not only see how it shineth which the eyes alone can perceive but also see how it soundeth see how it smelleth see how it tasteth see how hard it is and so the general experience of the senses as was said is called the lust of the eyes because the office of seeing wherein the eyes hold the prerogative the other senses by way of similitude take to themselves when they make search after any knowledge,244,1331,4.349999999999999,0.08675111116752486,0.12162162162162135,0.06492578661096404,5.15,0.1973777804590999,0.2027027027027026,0.1472851812646011,-76.95660365596216,-0.8336359488886557,-0.7747818116001385,-0.7600208592870126,4.285416666666667,0.7946171923626267,0.8327623989012668,0.7391550107281384,16.311,0.9403566154576601,0.8033583271728798,0.7646700826781694,32.2639589847093,-0.1341704622843897,-0.08809704577543206,-0.09793386890303861,0.0,-0.47259227462228603,-0.4406181172057236,-0.42402305100381094,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.5674}",0.5674,-0.028277074299573744,-0.44294312737992875,-0.27869645332242815,-0.04441391941391941,-0.3831778239239193,-1.163153385918625,-0.9044903628371462,-0.7509,-0.36506124591335476,-0.0962799754047961,-0.14481845529039258,-0.10484171333811262,-0.9505178129481855,-0.9571140110898605,-0.9602462238401466,44.129457979094624,-0.2028381679876189,0.07353612090638793,-0.08892761336668893

314,314,2553,2558,2563,"But, O Lord, Thou alone Lord without pride, because Thou art the only true Lord, who hast no lord; hath this third kind of temptation also ceased from me, or can it cease through this whole life? To wish, namely, to be feared and loved of men, for no other end, but that we may have a joy therein which is no joy? A miserable life this and a foul boastfulness! Hence especially it comes that men do neither purely love nor fear Thee. And therefore dost Thou resist the proud, and givest grace to the humble: yea, Thou thunderest down upon the ambitions of the world, and the foundations of the mountains tremble. Because now certain offices of human society make it necessary to be loved and feared of men, the adversary of our true blessedness layeth hard at us, every where spreading his snares of ""well-done, well-done""; that greedily catching at them, we may be taken unawares, and sever our joy from Thy truth, and set it in the deceivingness of men; and be pleased at being loved and feared, not for Thy sake, but in Thy stead: and thus having been made like him, he may have them for his own, not in the bands of charity, but in the bonds of punishment: who purposed to set his throne in the north, that dark and chilled they might serve him, pervertedly and crookedly imitating Thee. But we, O Lord, behold we are Thy little flock; possess us as Thine, stretch Thy wings over us, and let us fly under them. Be Thou our glory; let us be loved for Thee, and Thy word feared in us.

For sometimes I am grieved at my own praise, either when those things be praised in me, in which I mislike myself, or even lesser and slight goods are more esteemed than they ought. But again how know I whether I am therefore thus affected, because I would not have him who praiseth me differ from me about myself; not as being influenced by concern for him, but because those same good things which please me in myself, please me more when they please another also?

For I ask, Seeing ""day"" denotes not the stay only of the sun upon the earth (according to which day is one thing, night another); but also its whole circuit from east to east again; according to which we say, ""there passed so many days,"" the night being included when we say, ""so many days,"" and the nights not reckoned apart;—seeing then a day is completed by the motion of the sun and by his circuit from east to east again, I ask, does the motion alone make the day, or the stay in which that motion is completed, or both? For if the first be the day; then should we have a day, although the sun should finish that course in so small a space of time, as one hour comes to. If the second, then should not that make a day, if between one sun-rise and another there were but so short a stay, as one hour comes to; but the sun must go four and twenty times about, to complete one day. If both, then neither could that be called a day; if the sun should run his whole round in the space of one hour; nor that, if, while the sun stood still, so much time should overpass, as the sun usually makes his whole course in, from morning to morning. I will not therefore now ask, what that is which is called day; but, what time is, whereby we, measuring the circuit of the sun, should say that it was finished in half the time it was wont, if so be it was finished in so small a space as twelve hours; and comparing both times, should call this a single time, that a double time; even supposing the sun to run his round from east to east, sometimes in that single, sometimes in that double time. Let no man then tell me, that the motions of the heavenly bodies constitute times, because, when at the prayer of one, the sun had stood still, till he could achieve his victorious battle, the sun stood still, but time went on.

For that no body is moved, but in time, I hear; this Thou sayest; but that the motion of a body is time, I hear not; Thou sayest it not. For when a body is moved, I by time measure, how long it moveth, from the time it began to move until it left off? And if I did not see whence it began; and it continue to move so that I see not when it ends, I cannot measure, save perchance from the time I began, until I cease to see. And if I look long, I can only pronounce it to be a long time, but not how long; because when we say ""how long,"" we do it by comparison; as, ""this is as long as that,"" or ""twice so long as that,"" or the like. But when we can mark the distances of the places, whence and whither goeth the body moved, or his parts, if it moved as in a lathe, then can we say precisely, in how much time the motion of that body or his part, from this place unto that, was finished. Seeing therefore the motion of a body is one thing, that by which we measure how long it is, another; who sees not, which of the two is rather to be called time? For and if a body be sometimes moved, sometimes stands still, then we measure, not his motion only, but his standing still too by time; and we say, ""it stood still, as much as it moved""; or ""it stood still twice or thrice so long as it moved""; or any other space which our measuring hath either ascertained, or guessed; more or less, as we use to say.

I measure the motion of a body in time; and the time itself do I not measure?

This same time then, how do I measure? do we by a shorter time measure a longer, as by the space of a cubit, the space of a rood? for so indeed we seem by the space of a short syllable, to measure the space of a long syllable, and to say that this is double the other.

But neither do we this way obtain any certain measure of time; because it may be, that a shorter verse, pronounced more fully, may take up more time than a longer, pronounced hurriedly.

Suppose, now, the voice of a body begins to sound, and does sound, and sounds on, and list, it ceases; it is silence now, and that voice is past, and is no more a voice. Before it sounded, it was to come, and could not be measured, because as yet it was not, and now it cannot, because it is no longer. Then therefore while it sounded, it might; because there then was what might be measured. But yet even then it was not at a stay; for it was passing on, and passing away. Could it be measured the rather, for that? For while passing, it was being extended into some space of time, so that it might be measured, since the present hath no space. If therefore then it might, then, lo, suppose another voice hath begun to sound, and still soundeth in one continued tenor without any interruption; let us measure it while it sounds; seeing when it hath left sounding, it will then be past, and nothing left to be measured; let us measure it verily, and tell how much it is. But it sounds still, nor can it be measured but from the instant it began in, unto the end it left in. For the very space between is the thing we measure, namely, from some beginning unto some end. Wherefore, a voice that is not yet ended, cannot be measured, so that it may be said how long, or short it is; nor can it be called equal to another, or double to a single, or the like. But when ended, it no longer is. How may it then be measured? And yet we measure times; but yet neither those which are not yet, nor those which no longer are, nor those which are not lengthened out by some pause, nor those which have no bounds. We measure neither times to come, nor past, nor present, nor passing; and yet we do measure times.",courage my mind and press on mightily god is our helper he made us and not we ourselves press on where truth begins to dawn suppose now the voice of a body begins to sound and does sound and sounds on and list it ceases it is silence now and that voice is past and is no more a voice before it sounded it was to come and could not be measured because as yet it was not and now it cannot because it is no longer then therefore while it sounded it might because there then was what might be measured but yet even then it was not at a stay for it was passing on and passing away could it be measured the rather for that for while passing it was being extended into some space of time so that it might be measured since the present hath no space if therefore then it might then lo suppose another voice hath begun to sound and still soundeth in one continued tenor without any interruption let us measure it while it sounds seeing when it hath left sounding it will then be past and nothing left to be measured let us measure it verily and tell how much it is but it sounds still nor can it be measured but from the instant it began in unto the end it left in for the very space between is the thing we measure namely from some beginning unto some end wherefore a voice that is not yet ended cannot be measured so that it may be said how long or short it is nor can it be called equal to another or double to a single or the like but when ended it no longer is how may it then be measured and yet we measure times but yet neither those which are not yet nor those which no longer are nor those which are not lengthened out by some pause nor those which have no bounds we measure neither times to come nor past nor present nor passing and yet we do measure times,355,1830,8.550000000000002,0.31982694194536865,0.6891891891891893,0.26420861574053617,7.550000000000002,0.20351436049547633,0.5270270270270271,0.1526276599956292,43.65466500871786,0.03189699730303905,0.2304157960983299,0.07990601350299587,1.8815476190476188,-0.013929655786668802,0.21647978025331907,0.026676396828785205,7.247999999999996,-0.6107445809195252,-0.15376491709789888,-0.5185002003855159,100.80570351241585,0.5250328276198662,1.0061695356785327,0.4344280276767043,-0.502334365421737,-0.575028351699008,-0.5978645621226935,-0.5241231611883463,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.035, 'compound': -0.358}",-0.358,-0.6781491598001372,-1.5796585186095073,-1.2013438416376017,0.04183673469387755,-0.2884286740531552,-0.7071453959227195,-0.5802215757736638,-0.9977,-0.3343426152609129,-0.22274031563845054,-0.11037518917016527,0.27686821088237157,-0.5380518766138523,-0.3145639307891284,-0.4830763644982253,57.76845202349976,-0.8245899347389936,0.9181419710450908,-1.0918960950514136

The four short then, the first, third, fifth, and seventh, are but single, in respect of the four long, the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth. Every one of these to every one of those, hath a double time: I pronounce them, report on them, and find it so, as one's plain sense perceives. By plain sense then, I measure a long syllable by a short, and I sensibly find it to have twice so much; but when one sounds after the other, if the former be short, the latter long, how shall I detain the short one, and how, measuring, shall I apply it to the long, that I may find this to have twice so much; seeing the long does not begin to sound, unless the short leaves sounding? And that very long one do I measure as present, seeing I measure it not till it be ended? Now his ending is his passing away. What then is it I measure? where is the short syllable by which I measure? where the long which I measure? Both have sounded, have flown, passed away, are no more; and yet I measure, and confidently answer (so far as is presumed on a practised sense) that as to space of time this syllable is but single, that double. And yet I could not do this, unless they were already past and ended.

And still that which I conceived, was without form, not as being deprived of all form, but in comparison of more beautiful forms; and true reason did persuade me, that I must utterly uncase it of all remnants of form whatsoever, if I would conceive matter absolutely without form; and I could not; for sooner could I imagine that not to be at all, which should be deprived of all form, than conceive a thing betwixt form and nothing, neither formed, nor nothing, a formless almost nothing. So my mind gave over to question thereupon with my spirit, it being filled with the images of formed bodies, and changing and varying them, as it willed; and I bent myself to the bodies themselves, and looked more deeply into their changeableness, by which they cease to be what they have been, and begin to be what they were not; and this same shifting from form to form, I suspected to be through a certain formless state, not through a mere nothing; yet this I longed to know, not to suspect only.-If then my voice and pen would confess unto Thee the whole, whatsoever knots Thou didst open for me in this question, what reader would hold out to take in the whole?

Because this deep of waters, visible now, hath even in his depths, a light proper for its nature; perceivable in whatever degree unto the fishes, and creeping things in the bottom of it.

For very wonderful is this corporeal heaven; of which firmament between water and water, the second day, after the creation of light, Thou saidst, Let it be made, and it was made. Which firmament Thou calledst heaven; the heaven, that is, to this earth and sea, which Thou madest the third day, by giving a visible figure to the formless matter, which Thou madest before all days.

The maintainers of either of those two latter opinions will, upon hearing this, return for answer, ""we do not deny this formless matter to be indeed created by God, that God of Whom are all things, very good; for as we affirm that to be a greater good, which is created and formed, so we confess that to be a lesser good which is made capable of creation and form, yet still good. We say however that Scripture hath not set down, that God made this formlessness, as also it hath not many others; as the Cherubim, and Seraphim, and those which the Apostle distinctly speaks of, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers. All which that God made, is most apparent. Or if in that which is said, He made heaven and earth, all things be comprehended, what shall we say of the waters, upon which the Spirit of God moved? For if they be comprised in this word earth; how then can formless matter be meant in that name of earth, when we see the waters so beautiful? Or if it be so taken; why then is it written, that out of the same formlessness, the firmament was made, and called heaven; and that the waters were made, is not written? For the waters remain not formless and invisible, seeing we behold them flowing in so comely a manner. But if they then received that beauty, when God said, Let the waters under the firmament be gathered together, that so the gathering together be itself the forming of them; what will be said as to those waters above the firmament? Seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of so honourable a seat, nor is it written, by what word they were formed. If then Genesis is silent as to God's making of any thing, which yet that God did make neither sound faith nor well-grounded understanding doubteth, nor again will any sober teaching dare to affirm these waters to be coeternal with God, on the ground that we find them to be mentioned in the hook of Genesis, but when they were created, we do not find; why (seeing truth teaches us) should we not understand that formless matter (which this Scripture calls the earth invisible and without form, and darksome deep) to have been created of God out of nothing, and therefore not to be coeternal to Him; notwithstanding this history hath omitted to show when it was created?""",for should any attempt to dispute against these two last opinions thus if you will not allow that this formlessness of matter seems to be called by the name of heaven and earth ergo there was something which god had not made out of which to make heaven and earth for neither hath scripture told us that god made this matter unless we understand it to be signified by the name of heaven and earth or of earth alone when it is said in the beginning god made the heaven and earth that so in what follows and the earth was invisible and without form although it pleased him so to call the formless matter we are to understand no other matter but that which god made whereof is written above god made heaven and earth the maintainers of either of those two latter opinions will upon hearing this return for answer we do not deny this formless matter to be indeed created by god that god of whom are all things very good for as we affirm that to be a greater good which is created and formed so we confess that to be a lesser good which is made capable of creation and form yet still good we say however that scripture hath not set down that god made this formlessness as also it hath not many others as the cherubim and seraphim and those which the apostle distinctly speaks of thrones dominions principalities powers all which that god made is most apparent or if in that which is said he made heaven and earth all things be comprehended what shall we say of the waters upon which the spirit of god moved for if they be comprised in this word earth how then can formless matter be meant in that name of earth when we see the waters so beautiful or if it be so taken why then is it written that out of the same formlessness the firmament was made and called heaven and that the waters were made is not written for the waters remain not formless and invisible seeing we behold them flowing in so comely a manner but if they then received that beauty when god said let the waters under the firmament be gathered together that so the gathering together be itself the forming of them what will be said as to those waters above the firmament seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of so honourable a seat nor is it written by what word they were formed if then genesis is silent as to god own making of any thing which yet that god did make neither sound faith nor well grounded understanding doubteth nor again will any sober teaching dare to affirm these waters to be coeternal with god on the ground that we find them to be mentioned in the hook of genesis but when they were created we do not find why seeing truth teaches us should we not understand that formless matter which this scripture calls the earth invisible and without form and darksome deep to have been created of god out of nothing and therefore not to be coeternal to him notwithstanding this history hath omitted to show when it was created,549,3001,12.400000000000002,0.26402311519169813,1.2094594594594594,0.2164956270766549,11.400000000000002,0.184364125065351,1.0472972972972976,0.13595555193655498,246.30210093724455,0.6749095589565702,1.9193186660938901,0.7038955825317494,5.354707142857145,0.2797010267329879,1.1068976041507714,0.28541908089067014,22.127,0.05361524647494509,1.4175731333826167,0.03110081195655826,134.9023007121584,0.35891364336611764,1.550520531032802,0.30027286592007846,9.207099506745656,0.7414642123121603,2.4414934106748114,0.7623479188778964,"{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.9988}",0.9988,-0.12693194021510504,0.08696720304630877,-0.418760408079675,0.2692414529914529,-0.17070983214296717,0.4951454107865159,-0.17734148521030704,-0.9514,-0.2103973925569747,-0.19901619184259073,0.02859839784365638,1.195419452181447,-0.061496021938755106,1.2316761232581344,0.06823725951838411,87.54547158109006,-0.9365410351496242,2.7621082368967915,-1.2724881435283488

No. Because I see not in his mind, that he thought of this when he wrote these things, as I do see it in Thy truth to be certain.

405,405,3203,3211,3219,"But he that no otherwise understands In the Beginning He made, than if it were said, At first He made, can only truly understand heaven and earth of the matter of heaven and earth, that is, of the universal intelligible and corporeal creation. For if he would understand thereby the universe, as already formed, it may be rightly demanded of him, ""If God made this first, what made He afterwards?"" and after the universe, he will find nothing; whereupon must he against his will hear another question; ""How did God make this first, if nothing after?"" But when he says, God made matter first formless, then formed, there is no absurdity, if he be but qualified to discern, what precedes by eternity, what by time, what by choice, and what in original. By eternity, as God is before all things; by time, as the flower before the fruit; by choice, as the fruit before the flower; by original, as the sound before the tune. Of these four, the first and last mentioned, are with extreme difficulty understood, the two middle, easily. For a rare and too lofty a vision is it, to behold Thy Eternity, O Lord, unchangeably making things changeable; and thereby before them. And who, again, is of so sharp-sighted understanding, as to be able without great pains to discern, how the sound is therefore before the tune; because a tune is a formed sound; and a thing not formed, may exist; whereas that which existeth not, cannot be formed. Thus is the matter before the thing made; not because it maketh it, seeing itself is rather made; nor is it before by interval of time; for we do not first in time utter formless sounds without singing, and subsequently adapt or fashion them into the form of a chant, as wood or silver, whereof a chest or vessel is fashioned. For such materials do by time also precede the forms of the things made of them, but in singing it is not so; for when it is sung, its sound is heard; for there is not first a formless sound, which is afterwards formed into a chant. For each sound, so soon as made, passeth away, nor canst thou find ought to recall and by art to compose. So then the chant is concentrated in its sound, which sound of his is his matter. And this indeed is formed, that it may be a tune; and therefore (as I said) the matter of the sound is before the form of the tune; not before, through any power it hath to make it a tune; for a sound is no way the workmaster of the tune; but is something corporeal, subjected to the soul which singeth, whereof to make a tune. Nor is it first in time; for it is given forth together with the tune; nor first in choice, for a sound is not better than a tune, a tune being not only a sound, but a beautiful sound. But it is first in original, because a tune receives not form to become a sound, but a sound receives a form to become a tune. By this example, let him that is able, understand how the matter of things was first made, and called heaven and earth, because heaven and earth were made out of it. Yet was it not made first in time; because the forms of things give rise to time; but that was without form, but now is, in time, an object of sense together with its form. And yet nothing can be related of that matter, but as though prior in time, whereas in value it is last (because things formed are superior to things without form) and is preceded by the Eternity of the Creator: that so there might be out of nothing, whereof somewhat might be created.",but he that no otherwise understands in the beginning he made than if it were said at first he made can only truly understand heaven and earth of the matter of heaven and earth that is of the universal intelligible and corporeal creation for if he would understand thereby the universe as already formed it may be rightly demanded of him if god made this first what made he afterwards and after the universe he will find nothing whereupon must he against his will hear another question how did god make this first if nothing after but when he says god made matter first formless then formed there is no absurdity if he be but qualified to discern what precedes by eternity what by time what by choice and what in original by eternity as god is before all things by time as the flower before the fruit by choice as the fruit before the flower by original as the sound before the tune of these four the first and last mentioned are with extreme difficulty understood the two middle easily for a rare and too lofty a vision is it to behold thy eternity o lord unchangeably making things changeable and thereby before them and who again is of so sharp sighted understanding as to be able without great pains to discern how the sound is therefore before the tune because a tune is a formed sound and a thing not formed may exist whereas that which existeth not cannot be formed thus is the matter before the thing made not because it maketh it seeing itself is rather made nor is it before by interval of time for we do not first in time utter formless sounds without singing and subsequently adapt or fashion them into the form of a chant as wood or silver whereof a chest or vessel is fashioned for such materials do by time also precede the forms of the things made of them but in singing it is not so for when it is sung its sound is heard for there is not first a formless sound which is afterwards formed into a chant for each sound so soon as made passeth away nor canst thou find ought to recall and by art to compose so then the chant is concentrated in its sound which sound of his is his matter and this indeed is formed that it may be a tune and therefore as i said the matter of the sound is before the form of the tune not before through any power it hath to make it a tune for a sound is no way the workmaster of the tune but is something corporeal subjected to the soul which singeth whereof to make a tune nor is it first in time for it is given forth together with the tune nor first in choice for a sound is not better than a tune a tune being not only a sound but a beautiful sound but it is first in original because a tune receives not form to become a sound but a sound receives a form to become a tune by this example let him that is able understand how the matter of things was first made and called heaven and earth because heaven and earth were made out of it yet was it not made first in time because the forms of things give rise to time but that was without form but now is in time an object of sense together with its form and yet nothing can be related of that matter but as though prior in time whereas in value it is last because things formed are superior to things without form and is preceded by the eternity of the creator that so there might be out of nothing whereof somewhat might be created,647,3442,12.050000000000002,0.11642470080159013,1.162162162162162,0.09029708689967937,8.049999999999999,-0.13277483525044473,0.5945945945945943,-0.14014418769431145,147.20945157607582,0.23833614190742605,1.093461387738943,0.2802378274587001,22.879166666666666,1.9681522795443234,5.599663055089272,1.7732554517740544,27.737999999999996,0.13938668219120218,2.0101383461822784,0.10205643864543412,91.06170870756628,-0.0971756386263287,0.8506069955319535,-0.06805744870328662,4.108121938521555,-0.012942081720279825,0.8453531692213628,0.025145213428774384,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9944}",0.9944,-0.18197418049962558,0.0815624616140522,-0.4969059083690317,0.2546932234432235,-0.20128525450278859,0.41822878930796153,-0.28198258369083534,0.6066,0.0968075706970456,0.5993031358885017,0.3730519779049067,2.274492436720834,0.3947558356236227,3.0481298984176046,0.596061779119588,97.98631586695858,-1.2114484629452926,3.4086660501432315,-1.7159504707859257

Let us break our bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor to our house. Let us clothe the naked, and despise not those of our own flesh. Which fruits having sprung out of the earth, see it is good: and let our temporary light break forth; and ourselves, from this lower fruitfulness of action, arriving at the delightfulness of contemplation, obtaining the Word of Life above, appear like lights in the world, cleaving to the firmament of Thy Scripture. For there Thou instructest us, to divide between the things intellectual, and things of sense, as betwixt the day and the night; or between souls, given either to things intellectual, or things of sense, so that now not Thou only in the secret of Thy judgment, as before the firmament was made, dividest between the light and the darkness, but Thy spiritual children also set and ranked in the same firmament (now that Thy grace is laid open throughout the world), may give light upon the earth, and divide betwixt the day and the night, and be for signs of times, that old things are passed away, and, behold, all things are become new; and that our salvation is nearer than when we believed: and that the night is far spent, and the day is at hand: and that Thou wilt crown Thy year with blessing, sending the labourers of Thy goodness into Thy harvest, in sowing whereof, others have laboured, sending also into another field, whose harvest shall be in the end. Thus grantest Thou the prayers of him that asketh, and blessest the years of the just; but Thou art the same, and in Thy years which fail not, Thou preparest a garner for our passing years.

To another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, as it were the lesser light: to another faith; to another the gift of healing; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues. And all these as it were stars. For all these worketh the one and self-same spirit, dividing to every man his own as He will; and causing stars to appear manifestly, to profit withal. But the word of knowledge, wherein are contained all Sacraments, which are varied in their seasons as it were the moon, and those other notices of gifts, which are reckoned up in order, as it were stars, inasmuch as they come short of that brightness of wisdom, which gladdens the forementioned day, are only for the rule of the night. For they are necessary to such, as that Thy most prudent servant could not speak unto as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal; even he, who speaketh wisdom among those that are perfect. But the natural man, as it were a babe in Christ and fed on milk, until he be strengthened for solid meat and his eye be enabled to behold the Sun, let him not dwell in a night forsaken of all light, but be content with the light of the moon and the stars.

And for this end do we believe Thee, Lord, to have said to these kinds, Increase and multiply. For in this blessing, I conceive Thee to have granted us a power and a faculty, both to express several ways what we understand but one; and to understand several ways, what we read to be obscurely delivered but in one.

Thus did also the brethren, and such fruit did they bear, who out of Macedonia supplied what was lacking to him. But how grieved he for some trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto him, where he saith, At my first answer no man stood by me, but all men forsook me. I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

For neither in them that yield them, are the things yielded the fruit, but with what mind they yield them. He therefore that served God, and not his own belly, I plainly see why he rejoiced; I see it, and I rejoice with him. For he had received from the Philippians, what they had sent by Epaphroditus unto him: and yet I perceive why he rejoiced. For whereat he rejoiced upon that he fed; for, speaking in truth, I rejoiced (saith he) greatly in the Lord, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful, but it had become wearisome unto you. These Philippians then had now dried up, with a long weariness, and withered as it were as to bearing this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them, that they flourished again, not for himself, that they supplied his wants.

And after this didst Thou kindle certain lights in the firmament, Thy Holy ones, having the word of life; and shining with an eminent authority set on high through spiritual gifts; after that again, for the initiation of the unbelieving Gentiles, didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the Sacraments, and visible miracles, and forms of words according to the firmament of Thy Book, by which the faithful should be blessed and multiplied. Next didst Thou form the living soul of the faithful, through affections well ordered by the vigour of continency: and after that, the mind subjected to Thee alone and needing to imitate no human authority, hast Thou renewed after Thy image and likeness; and didst subject its rational actions to the excellency of the understanding, as the woman to the man; and to all Offices of Thy Ministry, necessary for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou willedst, that for their temporal uses, good things, fruitful to themselves in time to come, be given by the same faithful.
