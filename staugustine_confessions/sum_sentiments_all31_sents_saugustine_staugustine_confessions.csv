69,69,Thou also gavest me to desire no more than Thou gavest; and to my nurses willingly to give me what Thou gavest them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71,71,"For this my good from them, was good for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,"Nor, indeed, from them was it, but through them; for from Thee, O God, are all good things, and from my God is all my health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

77,77,"So I flung about at random limbs and voice, making the few signs I could, and such as I could, like, though in truth very little like, what I wished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,"And when I was not presently obeyed (my wishes being hurtful or unintelligible), then I was indignant with my elders for not submitting to me, with those owing me no service, for not serving me; and avenged myself on them by tears.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,"Such have I learnt infants to be from observing them; and that I was myself such, they, all unconscious, have shown me better than my nurses who knew it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

82,82,"Say, Lord, to me, Thy suppliant; say, all-pitying, to me, Thy pitiable one; say, did my infancy succeed another age of mine that died before it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,was it that which I spent within my mother's womb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,"for of that I have heard somewhat, and have myself seen women with child?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,85,"and what before that life again, O God my joy, was I any where or any body?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,86,"For this have I none to tell me, neither father nor mother, nor experience of others, nor mine own memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,87,"Dost Thou mock me for asking this, and bid me praise Thee and acknowledge Thee, for that I do know?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,88,"I acknowledge Thee, Lord of heaven and earth, and praise Thee for my first rudiments of being, and my infancy, whereof I remember nothing; for Thou hast appointed that man should from others guess much as to himself; and believe much on the strength of weak females.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,89,"Even then I had being and life, and (at my infancy's close) I could seek for signs whereby to make known to others my sensations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,90,"Whence could such a being be, save from Thee, Lord?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,91,Shall any be his own artificer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,92,"or can there elsewhere be derived any vein, which may stream essence and life into us, save from thee, O Lord, in whom essence and life are one?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,93,for Thou Thyself art supremely Essence and Life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,94,"For Thou art most high, and art not changed, neither in Thee doth to-day come to a close; yet in Thee doth it come to a close; because all such things also are in Thee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,97,"How many of ours and our fathers' years have flowed away through Thy ""to-day,"" and from it received the measure and the mould of such being as they had; and still others shall flow away, and so receive the mould of their degree of being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,98,"But Thou art still the same, and all things of tomorrow, and all beyond, and all of yesterday, and all behind it, Thou hast done to-day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,99,"What is it to me, though any comprehend not this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,100,"Let him also rejoice and say, What thing is this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

103,103,"Alas, for man's sin!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,"So saith man, and Thou pitiest him; for Thou madest him, but sin in him Thou madest not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,105,Who remindeth me of the sins of my infancy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,106,"for in Thy sight none is pure from sin, not even the infant whose life is but a day upon the earth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,107,Who remindeth me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,108,"doth not each little infant, in whom I see what of myself I remember not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,109,What then was my sin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,110,was it that I hung upon the breast and cried?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,111,"for should I now so do for food suitable to my age, justly should I be laughed at and reproved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,"What I then did was worthy reproof; but since I could not understand reproof, custom and reason forbade me to be reproved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,113,"For those habits, when grown, we root out and cast away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,114,"Now no man, though he prunes, wittingly casts away what is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,115,"Or was it then good, even for a while, to cry for what, if given, would hurt?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,"bitterly to resent, that persons free, and its own elders, yea, the very authors of its birth, served it not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,117,"that many besides, wiser than it, obeyed not the nod of its good pleasure?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,118,"to do its best to strike and hurt, because commands were not obeyed, which had been obeyed to its hurt?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,119,"The weakness then of infant limbs, not its will, is its innocence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"Myself have seen and known even a baby envious; it could not speak, yet it turned pale and looked bitterly on its foster-brother.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,121,Who knows not this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,122,Mothers and nurses tell you that they allay these things by I know not what remedies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,123,"Is that too innocence, when the fountain of milk is flowing in rich abundance, not to endure one to share it, though in extremest need, and whose very life as yet depends thereon?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,124,"We bear gently with all this, not as being no or slight evils, but because they will disappear as years increase; for, though tolerated now, the very same tempers are utterly intolerable when found in riper years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,"Thou, then, O Lord my God, who gavest life to this my infancy, furnishing thus with senses (as we see) the frame Thou gavest, compacting its limbs, ornamenting its proportions, and, for its general good and safety, implanting in it all vital functions, Thou commandest me to praise Thee in these things, to confess unto Thee, and sing unto Thy name, Thou most Highest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"For Thou art God, Almighty and Good, even hadst Thou done nought but only this, which none could do but Thou: whose Unity is the mould of all things; who out of Thy own fairness makest all things fair; and orderest all things by Thy law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,127,"This age then, Lord, whereof I have no remembrance, which I take on others' word, and guess from other infants that I have passed, true though the guess be, I am yet loth to count in this life of mine which I live in this world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,128,"For no less than that which I spent in my mother's womb, is it hid from me in the shadows of forgetfulness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,129,"But if I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me, where, I beseech Thee, O my God, where, Lord, or when, was I Thy servant guiltless?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,130,"But, lo! that period I pass by; and what have I now to do with that, of which I can recall no vestige?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,"Passing hence from infancy, I came to boyhood, or rather it came to me, displacing infancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,132,"Nor did that depart, (for whither went it?) and yet it was no more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,133,"For I was no longer a speechless infant, but a speaking boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,134,This I remember; and have since observed how I learned to speak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,135,"It was not that my elders taught me words (as, soon after, other learning) in any set method; but I, longing by cries and broken accents and various motions of my limbs to express my thoughts, that so I might have my will, and yet unable to express all I willed, or to whom I willed, did myself, by the understanding which Thou, my God, gavest me, practise the sounds in my memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,"When they named any thing, and as they spoke turned towards it, I saw and remembered that they called what they would point out by the name they uttered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,137,"And that they meant this thing and no other was plain from the motion of their body, the natural language, as it were, of all nations, expressed by the countenance, glances of the eye, gestures of the limbs, and tones of the voice, indicating the affections of the mind, as it pursues, possesses, rejects, or shuns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,138,"And thus by constantly hearing words, as they occurred in various sentences, I collected gradually for what they stood; and having broken in my mouth to these signs, I thereby gave utterance to my will.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,139,"Thus I exchanged with those about me these current signs of our wills, and so launched deeper into the stormy intercourse of human life, yet depending on parental authority and the beck of elders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,"O God my God, what miseries and mockeries did I now experience, when obedience to my teachers was proposed to me, as proper in a boy, in order that in this world I might prosper, and excel in tongue-science, which should serve to the ""praise of men,"" and to deceitful riches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,141,"Next I was put to school to get learning, in which I (poor wretch) knew not what use there was; and yet, if idle in learning, I was beaten.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,142,"For this was judged right by our forefathers; and many, passing the same course before us, framed for us weary paths, through which we were fain to pass; multiplying toil and grief upon the sons of Adam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,143,"But, Lord, we found that men called upon Thee, and we learnt from them to think of Thee (according to our powers) as of some great One, who, though hidden from our senses, couldest hear and help us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,144,"For so I began, as a boy, to pray to Thee, my aid and refuge; and broke the fetters of my tongue to call on Thee, praying Thee, though small, yet with no small earnestness, that I might not be beaten at school.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,145,"And when Thou heardest me not (not thereby giving me over to folly), my elders, yea my very parents, who yet wished me no ill, mocked my stripes, my then great and grievous ill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,146,"Is there, Lord, any of soul so great, and cleaving to Thee with so intense affection (for a sort of stupidity will in a way do it); but is there any one who, from cleaving devoutly to Thee, is endued with so great a spirit, that he can think as lightly of the racks and hooks and other torments (against which, throughout all lands, men call on Thee with extreme dread), mocking at those by whom they are feared most bitterly, as our parents mocked the torments which we suffered in boyhood from our masters?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,147,For we feared not our torments less; nor prayed we less to Thee to escape them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,148,"And yet we sinned, in writing or reading or studying less than was exacted of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,149,"For we wanted not, O Lord, memory or capacity, whereof Thy will gave enough for our age; but our sole delight was play; and for this we were punished by those who yet themselves were doing the like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,150,"But elder folks' idleness is called ""business""; that of boys, being really the same, is punished by those elders; and none commiserates either boys or men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,151,"For will any of sound discretion approve of my being beaten as a boy, because, by playing a ball, I made less progress in studies which I was to learn, only that, as a man, I might play more unbeseemingly?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
152,152,and what else did he who beat me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,153,"who, if worsted in some trifling discussion with his fellow-tutor, was more embittered and jealous than I when beaten at ball by a play-fellow?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,154,"And yet, I sinned herein, O Lord God, the Creator and Disposer of all things in nature, of sin the Disposer only, O Lord my God, I sinned in transgressing the commands of my parents and those of my masters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
155,155,"For what they, with whatever motive, would have me learn, I might afterwards have put to good use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,156,"For I disobeyed, not from a better choice, but from love of play, loving the pride of victory in my contests, and to have my ears tickled with lying fables, that they might itch the more; the same curiosity flashing from my eyes more and more, for the shows and games of my elders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,157,"Yet those who give these shows are in such esteem, that almost all wish the same for their children, and yet are very willing that they should be beaten, if those very games detain them from the studies, whereby they would have them attain to be the givers of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,158,"Look with pity, Lord, on these things, and deliver us who call upon Thee now; deliver those too who call not on Thee yet, that they may call on Thee, and Thou mayest deliver them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
159,159,"As a boy, then, I had already heard of an eternal life, promised us through the humility of the Lord our God stooping to our pride; and even from the womb of my mother, who greatly hoped in Thee, I was sealed with the mark of His cross and salted with His salt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
160,160,"Thou sawest, Lord, how while yet a boy, being seized on a time with sudden oppression of the stomach, and like near to death Thou sawest, my God (for Thou wert my keeper), with what eagerness and what faith I sought, from the pious care of my mother and Thy Church, the mother of us all, the baptism of Thy Christ, my God and Lord.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,161,"Whereupon the mother of my flesh, being much troubled (since, with a heart pure in Thy faith, she even more lovingly travailed in birth of my salvation), would in eager haste have provided for my consecration and cleansing by the health-giving sacraments, confessing Thee, Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins, unless I had suddenly recovered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,162,"And so, as if I must needs be again polluted should I live, my cleansing was deferred, because the defilements of sin would, after that washing, bring greater and more perilous guilt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,163,"I then already believed: and my mother, and the whole household, except my father: yet did not he prevail over the power of my mother's piety in me, that as he did not yet believe, so neither should I.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
164,164,"For it was her earnest care that Thou my God, rather than he, shouldest be my father; and in this Thou didst aid her to prevail over her husband, whom she, the better, obeyed, therein also obeying Thee, who hast so commanded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165,165,"I beseech Thee, my God, I would fain know, if so Thou willest, for what purpose my baptism was then deferred?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,166,"was it for my good that the rein was laid loose, as it were, upon me, for me to sin?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,167,or was it not laid loose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

724,724,"""But our true Life came down hither, and bore our death, and slew him, out of the abundance of His own life: and He thundered, calling aloud to us to return hence to Him into that secret place, whence He came forth to us, first into the Virgin's womb, wherein He espoused the human creation, our mortal flesh, that it might not be for ever mortal, and thence like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, rejoicing as a giant to run his course. For He lingered not, but ran, calling aloud by words, deeds, death, life, descent, ascension; crying aloud to us to return unto Him. And He departed from our eyes, that we might return into our heart, and there find Him. For He departed, and lo, He is here. He would not be long with us, yet left us not; for He departed thither, whence He never parted, because the world was made by Him. And in this world He was, and into this world He came to save sinners, unto whom my soul confesseth, and He healeth it, for it hath sinned against Him. O ye sons of men, how long so slow of heart? Even now, after the descent of Life to you, will ye not ascend and live? But whither ascend ye, when ye are on high, and set your mouth against the heavens? Descend, that ye may ascend, and ascend to God. For ye have fallen, by ascending against Him.""",-0.04655207570404649,-0.05787074942661859,-0.09647157157780456,-0.10184660757062834,-0.02080787480877225,-0.03442144181127275,-0.05724078810285503,-0.043172757825695754,0.09344339522322405,-0.10133108736055618,0.002975494488535408,0.07141913631867937,-0.6289475738424746,-0.7772500594547751,-0.6324147497416425,-0.5310166103310829,-1.4246190811517954,-0.24687349366009495,-0.8787215643244276,-0.15181680417275256,-0.4141748366053329,-0.15708041096044073,0.12070143465895102,-0.8403773326848284,-0.7671258797055365,-0.5443592592460118,-0.6430109138270698,0.07290015572919344,0.2706689416708851,-1.0702457892924682,-0.7113559880702581

1115,1115,"""Perish every thing, dismiss we these empty vanities, and betake ourselves to the one search for truth! Life is vain, death uncertain; if it steals upon us on a sudden, in what state shall we depart hence? and where shall we learn what here we have neglected? and shall we not rather suffer the punishment of this negligence? What, if death itself cut off and end all care and feeling? Then must this be ascertained. But God forbid this! It is no vain and empty thing, that the excellent dignity of the authority of the Christian Faith hath overspread the whole world. Never would such and so great things be by God wrought for us, if with the death of the body the life of the soul came to an end. Wherefore delay then to abandon worldly hopes, and give ourselves wholly to seek after God and the blessed life? But wait! Even those things are pleasant; they have some, and no small sweetness. We must not lightly abandon them, for it were a shame to return again to them. See, it is no great matter now to obtain some station, and then what should we more wish for? We have store of powerful friends; if nothing else offer, and we be in much haste, at least a presidentship may be given us: and a wife with some money, that she increase not our charges: and this shall be the bound of desire. Many great men, and most worthy of imitation, have given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage.""",-0.05302776437039441,-0.04763689725838908,-0.08770416595811555,0.05452616550077909,0.005776452271723604,-0.0572530798768382,-0.09010466469259618,-0.02310255993264508,-0.03465801057662411,-0.19157873510438284,-0.0006776944392674535,0.2378939895738619,-0.5230812113263273,-0.48857413914878695,-0.49704765745392626,-0.2694713450630172,0.32956794356892216,-0.7045529826525972,-1.3087598609244013,0.006619587210403678,-0.3886964962188825,-0.551709042491046,-0.07784122595584114,-0.2738458255832228,-0.9635947678240071,-0.6402612671636311,-1.1322977438279964,-1.0802004492850361,0.09028815798070497,-0.7095236267612849,-1.2638165542075008

All which that God made, is most apparent. Or if in that which is said, He made heaven and earth, all things be comprehended, what shall we say of the waters, upon which the Spirit of God moved? For if they be comprised in this word earth; how then can formless matter be meant in that name of earth, when we see the waters so beautiful? Or if it be so taken; why then is it written, that out of the same formlessness, the firmament was made, and called heaven; and that the waters were made, is not written? For the waters remain not formless and invisible, seeing we behold them flowing in so comely a manner. But if they then received that beauty, when God said, Let the waters under the firmament be gathered together, that so the gathering together be itself the forming of them; what will be said as to those waters above the firmament? Seeing neither if formless would they have been worthy of so honourable a seat, nor is it written, by what word they were formed. If then Genesis is silent as to God's making of any thing, which yet that God did make neither sound faith nor well-grounded understanding doubteth, nor again will any sober teaching dare to affirm these waters to be coeternal with God, on the ground that we find them to be mentioned in the hook of Genesis, but when they were created, we do not find; why (seeing truth teaches us) should we not understand that formless matter (which this Scripture calls the earth invisible and without form, and darksome deep) to have been created of God out of nothing, and therefore not to be coeternal to Him; notwithstanding this history hath omitted to show when it was created?""",0.2309131956248868,0.29620226085810225,0.2851158575964648,0.1736684967966964,0.1173000935839836,0.16924911034175122,0.2630592830387745,0.3824351035204628,0.10888193908793038,0.12308532042351332,0.0024141358638028556,0.35765359463531254,1.455084396793219,1.7867651879055166,2.0316553602047907,0.8554398870188894,0.8949173023980294,1.1903048257435815,1.6702530347395208,1.8164506733948964,1.8916149683684216,2.2592610559500352,1.3340176939715684,1.013200763601783,0.20731171718013428,1.646297669140767,1.3755441724651574,1.800085871395314,0.8457209469422237,1.0139267053321457,0.8971583053888424

3310,3310,"For these fruits are due to such as minister the spiritual doctrine unto us out of their understanding of the divine mysteries; and they are due to them, as men; yea and due to them also, as the living soul, which giveth itself as an example, in all continency; and due unto them also, as flying creatures, for their blessings which are multiplied upon the earth, because their sound went out into all lands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3311,3311,"But they are fed by these fruits, that are delighted with them; nor are they delighted with them, whose God is their belly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3312,3312,"For neither in them that yield them, are the things yielded the fruit, but with what mind they yield them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3313,3313,"He therefore that served God, and not his own belly, I plainly see why he rejoiced; I see it, and I rejoice with him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3315,3315,"For whereat he rejoiced upon that he fed; for, speaking in truth, I rejoiced (saith he) greatly in the Lord, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful, but it had become wearisome unto you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3316,3316,"These Philippians then had now dried up, with a long weariness, and withered as it were as to bearing this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them, that they flourished again, not for himself, that they supplied his wants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3327,3327,"For ye Philippians also know (saith he), that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3328,3328,For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3332,3332,Verily not for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3333,3333,But how know we this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3334,3334,"Because himself says immediately, not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3335,3335,"I have learned of Thee, my God, to distinguish betwixt a gift, and fruit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3336,3336,"A gift, is the thing itself which he gives, that imparts these necessaries unto us; as money, meat, drink, clothing, shelter, help: but the fruit, is the good and right will of the giver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3337,3337,"For the Good Master said not only, He that receiveth a prophet, but added, in the name of a prophet: nor did He only say, He that receiveth a righteous man, but added, in the name of a righteous man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3338,3338,"So verily shall the one receive the reward of a prophet, the other, the reward of a righteous man: nor saith He only, He that shall give to drink a cup of cold water to one of my little ones; but added, in the name of a disciple: and so concludeth, Verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3339,3339,"The gift is, to receive a prophet, to receive a righteous man, to give a cup of cold water to a disciple: but the fruit, to do this in the name of a prophet, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a disciple.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3340,3340,"With fruit was Elijah fed by the widow that knew she fed a man of God, and therefore fed him: but by the raven was he fed with a gift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3341,3341,"Nor was the inner man of Elijah so fed, but the outer only; which might also for want of that food have perished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3342,3342,"I will then speak what is true in Thy sight, O Lord, that when carnal men and infidels (for the gaining and initiating whom, the initiatory Sacraments and the mighty workings of miracles are necessary, which we suppose to be signified by the name of fishes and whales) undertake the bodily refreshment, or otherwise succour Thy servant with something useful for this present life; whereas they be ignorant, why this is to be done, and to what end; neither do they feed these, nor are these fed by them; because neither do the one do it out of an holy and right intent; nor do the other rejoice at their gifts, whose fruit they as yet behold not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3343,3343,"For upon that is the mind fed, of which it is glad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3344,3344,"And therefore do not the fishes and whales feed upon such meats, as the earth brings not forth until after it was separated and divided from the bitterness of the waves of the sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3346,3346,"Yea we also see the same, and behold, all things are very good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3347,3347,"Of the several kinds of Thy works, when Thou hadst said ""let them be,"" and they were, Thou sawest each that it was good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3348,3348,"Seven times have I counted it to be written, that Thou sawest that that which Thou madest was good: and this is the eighth, that Thou sawest every thing that Thou hadst made, and, behold, it was not only good, but also very good, as being now altogether.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3351,3351,"And I looked narrowly to find, whether seven, or eight times Thou sawest that Thy works were good, when they pleased Thee; but in Thy seeing I found no times, whereby I might understand that Thou sawest so often, what Thou madest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3352,3352,"And I said, ""Lord, is not this Thy Scripture true, since Thou art true, and being Truth, hast set it forth? why then dost Thou say unto me, 'that in Thy seeing there be no times'; whereas this Thy Scripture tells me, that what Thou madest each day, Thou sawest that it was good: and when I counted them, I found how often.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3353,3353,"Unto this Thou answerest me, for Thou art my God, and with a strong voice tellest Thy servant in his inner ear, breaking through my deafness and crying, ""O man, that which My Scripture saith, I say: and yet doth that speak in time; but time has no relation to My Word; because My Word exists in equal eternity with Myself. So the things which ye see through My Spirit, I see; like as what ye speak by My Spirit, I speak. And so when ye see those things in time, I see them not in time; as when ye speak in time, I speak them not in time.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3354,3354,"And I heard, O Lord my God, and drank up a drop of sweetness out of Thy truth, and understood, that certain men there be who mislike Thy works; and say, that many of them Thou madest, compelled by necessity; such as the fabric of the heavens, and harmony of the stars; and that Thou madest them not of what was Thine, but that they were otherwhere and from other sources created, for Thee to bring together and compact and combine, when out of Thy conquered enemies Thou raisedst up the walls of the universe; that they, bound down by the structure, might not again be able to rebel against Thee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3355,3355,"For other things, they say Thou neither madest them, nor even compactedst them, such as all flesh and all very minute creatures, and whatsoever hath its root in the earth; but that a mind at enmity with Thee, and another nature not created by Thee, and contrary unto Thee, did, in these lower stages of the world, beget and frame these things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3357,3357,"But they who by Thy Spirit see these things, Thou seest in them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3358,3358,"Therefore when they see that these things are good, Thou seest that they are good; and whatsoever things for Thy sake please, Thou pleasest in them, and what through Thy Spirit please us, they please Thee in us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3363,3363,"Answer is made me; ""because the things which we know by His Spirit, even these no one knoweth, but the Spirit of God. For as it is rightly said unto those that were to speak by the Spirit of God, it is not ye that speak: so is it rightly said to them that know through the Spirit of God, 'It is not ye that know.' And no less then is it rightly said to those that see through the Spirit of God, 'It is not ye that see'; so whatsoever through the Spirit of God they see to be good, it is not they, but God that sees that it is good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3364,3364,"It is one thing then for a man to think that to be ill which is good, as the forenamed do; another, that that which is good, a man should see that it is good (as Thy creatures be pleasing unto many, because they be good, whom yet Thou pleasest not in them, when they prefer to enjoy them, to Thee); and another, that when a man sees a thing that it is good, God should in him see that it is good, so, namely, that He should be loved in that which He made, Who cannot be loved, but by the Holy Ghost which He hath given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3365,3365,"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Which is given unto us: by Whom we see that whatsoever in any degree is, is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3374,3374,"And as in his soul there is one power which has dominion by directing, another made subject, that it might obey; so was there for the man, corporeally also, made a woman, who in the mind of her reasonable understanding should have a parity of nature, but in the sex of her body, should be in like manner subject to the sex of her husband, as the appetite of doing is fain to conceive the skill of right-doing from the reason of the mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3377,3377,"They have then their succession of morning and evening, part secretly, part apparently; for they were made of nothing, by Thee, not of Thee; not of any matter not Thine, or that was before, but of matter concreated (that is, at the same time created by Thee), because to its state without form, Thou without any interval of time didst give form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3378,3378,"For seeing the matter of heaven and earth is one thing, and the form another, Thou madest the matter of merely nothing, but the form of the world out of the matter without form: yet both together, so that the form should follow the matter, without any interval of delay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3381,3381,"But when Thou begannest to execute in time the things predestinated, to the end Thou mightest reveal hidden things, and rectify our disorders; for our sins hung over us, and we had sunk into the dark deep; and Thy good Spirit was borne over us, to help us in due season; and Thou didst justify the ungodly, and dividest them from the wicked; and Thou madest the firmament of authority of Thy Book between those placed above, who were to be docile unto Thee, and those under, who were to be subject to them: and Thou gatheredst together the society of unbelievers into one conspiracy, that the zeal of the faithful might appear, and they might bring forth works of mercy, even distributing to the poor their earthly riches, to obtain heavenly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3382,3382,"And after this didst Thou kindle certain lights in the firmament, Thy Holy ones, having the word of life; and shining with an eminent authority set on high through spiritual gifts; after that again, for the initiation of the unbelieving Gentiles, didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the Sacraments, and visible miracles, and forms of words according to the firmament of Thy Book, by which the faithful should be blessed and multiplied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3383,3383,"Next didst Thou form the living soul of the faithful, through affections well ordered by the vigour of continency: and after that, the mind subjected to Thee alone and needing to imitate no human authority, hast Thou renewed after Thy image and likeness; and didst subject its rational actions to the excellency of the understanding, as the woman to the man; and to all Offices of Thy Ministry, necessary for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou willedst, that for their temporal uses, good things, fruitful to themselves in time to come, be given by the same faithful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
