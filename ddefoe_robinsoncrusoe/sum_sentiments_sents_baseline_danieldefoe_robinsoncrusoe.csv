country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the
negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes
having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and
the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness;
and indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour
there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go
like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near
a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste,
uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring

from England; and who in that time, and with that little addition,
could scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds
sterling, and that increasing too—for me to think of such a voyage was

might get on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my
relief—so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have
saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned
as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have

741,741,289,"In the interval of this operation I took up the
Bible and began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the
book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these, “Call on
Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify Me.” These words were very apt to my case, and made some
impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so
much as they did afterwards; for, as for being _delivered_, the word
had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote, so
impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the
children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can God
spread a table in the wilderness?” so I began to say, “Can God Himself
deliver me from this place?” And as it was not for many years that any
hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but,
however, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon

driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay

testify, from my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,
love, and affection, is much the more proper frame for prayer than that
of terror and discomposure: and that under the dread of mischief
impending, a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the
duty of praying to God than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for

1272,1272,482,"Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the place where they made
their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when
they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all
that was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity
of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any
certain time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would
do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright
them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it
aside; and then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some
convenient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the
middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure
to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling
in upon them with my three pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but

my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to

going to kill in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that
they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I
thought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove
before my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone,
and not perceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself
to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to
me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my
ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my
servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, “Now
I may certainly venture to the mainland, for this fellow will serve me
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for
provisions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to shun.” I waked with this thought;
and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of
my escape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great

however it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of
the works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of
His creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of
their souls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same
powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of
kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing good and receiving good that He has given to us;
and that when He pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these,
they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for

pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but
stayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered
away a good distance from the place where she fell: however, he found
her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his
ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun
again, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any
other mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time:

and cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that
purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good

when my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master,
master, they are come, they are come!” I jumped up, and regardless of
danger I went, as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little
grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick
wood; I say, regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not
my custom to do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea,
I presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing
in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and
the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed,
presently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay

2142,2142,700,"As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,
and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has
two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions;
first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually
attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively
hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being
covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle
with you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give
him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step
out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best
way is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you
stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an
affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a
bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets
all other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have
satisfaction in point of honour—that is his first quality: the next is,
if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he
has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes
