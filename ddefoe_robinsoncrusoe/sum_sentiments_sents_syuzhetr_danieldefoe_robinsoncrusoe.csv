1,2,"START IN LIFE   I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull.",0.5,1,3,0,,,,,,,,,
2,3,"He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now calledâ""nay we call ourselves and write our nameâ""Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.",0.4,0,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
3,4,"I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.",-0.1,0,-2,2,,,,,,,,,
4,5,"What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.",0.4,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,
5,6,"Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.",-0.1,0,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
6,7,"My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.",3.3,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,
7,8,"My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.",1.4,2,1,2,,,,,,,,,
8,9,"He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject.",-0.3,0,0,-3,,,,,,,,,
9,10,"He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving fatherâs house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.",3.75,4,8,3,,,,,,,,,
10,11,"He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.",2.35,4,10,6,,,,,,,,,
11,12,"He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thingâ""viz.",0.75,1,3,1,,,,,,,,,
12,13,"that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.",-0.25,1,-1,0,,,,,,,,,
13,14,"He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every dayâs experience to know it more sensibly.",3.35,4,4,6,,,,,,,,,
14,15,"After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.",3.35,1,2,13,,,,,,,,,
15,16,"I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himselfâ""I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.",-0.45,-2,-7,3,,,,,,,,,
16,17,"I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be otherwise?",0.5,1,1,0,,,,,,,,,
17,18,"and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my fatherâs desire.",1.2,0,3,0,,,,,,,,,
18,19,But alas!,-0.4,0,-1,0,,,,,,,,,
19,20,"a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my fatherâs further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.",0.35,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,
20,21,"However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time that I had lost.",2.45,5,8,2,,,,,,,,,
21,22,"This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.",2.9,2,5,0,,,,,,,,,
22,23,"Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, âThat boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.â  It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to.",-2.0,-5,0,-4,,,,,,,,,
23,24,"But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to London in his fatherâs ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking Godâs blessing or my fatherâs, without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.",-0.8,1,2,1,,,,,,,,,
24,25,"Never any young adventurerâs misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine.",-0.6,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,
25,26,"The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind.",-2.65,-3,-5,-1,,,,,,,,,
26,27,"I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my fatherâs house, and abandoning my duty.",0.25,2,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
27,28,"All the good counsels of my parents, my fatherâs tears and my motherâs entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.",-1.05,0,-1,0,,,,,,,,,
28,29,"All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter.",0.9,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,
29,30,"I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.",-0.4,-4,2,0,,,,,,,,,
30,31,"Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.",3.15,3,9,2,,,,,,,,,
31,32,"These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.",5.05,6,9,3,,,,,,,,,
32,33,"I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after.",2.3,2,1,2,,,,,,,,,
33,34,"And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me; âWell, Bob,â says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, âhow do you do after it?",2.45,3,3,4,,,,,,,,,
34,35,"I warrant you were frighted, werânât you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?â âA capful dâyou call it?â said I; ââtwas a terrible storm.â âA storm, you fool you,â replies he; âdo you call that a storm?",-1.75,-2,-5,-3,,,,,,,,,
35,36,"why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but youâre but a fresh-water sailor, Bob.",-0.25,2,4,1,,,,,,,,,
36,37,"Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and weâll forget all that; dâye see what charming weather âtis now?â To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was made half drunk with it: and in that one nightâs wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future.",-2.3,-3,-4,-2,,,,,,,,,
37,38,"In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress.",-1.05,-1,-3,0,,,,,,,,,
38,39,"I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those fitsâ""for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire.",2.6,0,4,3,,,,,,,,,
39,40,"But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.",-1.4,-4,-3,-3,,,,,,,,,
40,41,"The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm.",-0.1,1,2,0,,,,,,,,,
41,42,"Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contraryâ""viz.",-0.2,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,
42,43,"at south-westâ""for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.",0.25,1,3,-1,,,,,,,,,
43,44,"We had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard.",0.25,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,
44,45,"However, the Roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible.",0.3,1,3,1,,,,,,,,,
45,46,"By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.",0.3,0,-2,4,,,,,,,,,
46,47,By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves.,-1.2,-1,-6,-3,,,,,,,,,
47,48,"The master, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several times, âLord be merciful to us!",1.25,3,3,3,,,,,,,,,
48,49,we shall be all lost!,-0.75,-1,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,
49,50,we shall be all undone!â and the like.,0.0,0,2,0,,,,,,,,,
50,51,"During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted.",-5.5,-6,-7,-7,,,,,,,,,
51,52,"I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered.",-2.6,-3,-8,-1,,,,,,,,,
52,53,"Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing.",0.25,0,2,2,,,,,,,,,
53,54,"The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.",0.5,1,3,1,,,,,,,,,
54,55,"Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a clear deck.",-0.3,-1,-5,4,,,,,,,,,
55,56,"Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little.",-0.35,-1,-2,0,,,,,,,,,
56,57,"But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition that I can by no words describe it.",-4.0,-3,-6,-5,,,,,,,,,
57,58,But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse.,-2.0,-3,-6,-3,,,,,,,,,
58,59,"We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder.",-0.1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,
59,60,"It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by _founder_ till I inquired.",1.65,2,4,2,,,,,,,,,
60,61,"However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom.",-0.2,1,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,
61,62,"In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water in the hold.",-2.75,-1,-5,0,,,,,,,,,
62,63,Then all hands were called to the pump.,0.0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,
63,64,"At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin.",-1.4,-2,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,
64,65,"However, the men roused me, and told me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very heartily.",1.55,3,0,1,,,,,,,,,
65,66,"While this was doing the master, seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress.",-2.25,0,-6,-2,,,,,,,,,
66,67,"I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened.",-1.5,-2,-4,-2,,,,,,,,,
67,68,"In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon.",-0.5,-1,0,0,,,,,,,,,
68,69,"As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.",-1.4,-1,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
69,70,"We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.",0.6,2,0,2,,,,,,,,,
70,71,"It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the shipâs side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat.",-0.35,-2,5,-1,,,,,,,,,
71,72,"It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.",1.75,3,5,4,,,,,,,,,
72,73,"We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea.",-0.25,-1,0,1,,,,,,,,,
73,74,"I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.",-3.0,-3,-5,-2,,,,,,,,,
74,75,"While we were in this conditionâ""the men yet labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shoreâ""we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along the strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind.",0.15,-2,0,1,,,,,,,,,
75,76,"Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we thought fit.",3.8,3,8,2,,,,,,,,,
76,77,"Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviourâs parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not drowned.",1.75,2,1,3,,,,,,,,,
77,78,"But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it.",-0.2,-1,-3,-2,,,,,,,,,
78,79,"I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.",-0.75,-1,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,
79,80,"Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.",-0.65,-1,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,
80,81,"My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the masterâs son, was now less forward than I.",2.15,1,0,3,,,,,,,,,
81,82,"The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone âYoung man,â says he, âyou ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man.â âWhy, sir,â said I, âwill you go to sea no more?â âThat is another case,â said he; âit is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist.",1.11022302462516e-16,-1,-5,-1,,,,,,,,,
82,83,"Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.",0.5,1,2,0,,,,,,,,,
83,84,"Pray,â continues he, âwhat are you; and on what account did you go to sea?â Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion: âWhat had I done,â says he, âthat such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship?",-0.65,-2,1,2,,,,,,,,,
84,85,"I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds.â This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go.",-0.5,-1,-2,1,,,,,,,,,
85,86,"However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me.",-0.6,1,0,-1,,,,,,,,,

2112,2113,"Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of November; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid, about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing, though at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass still.",4.95,4,5,6,,,,,,,,,
2113,2114,"We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we should soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.",0.75,1,-1,1,,,,,,,,,
2114,2115,"It was about two hours before night when, our guide being something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.",-2.75,0,-7,-1,,,,,,,,,

2118,2119,"It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have fired at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man.",-3.75,-2,-6,-3,,,,,,,,,
2119,2120,"But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Fridayâs pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth.",-5.45,-4,-16,-3,,,,,,,,,
2120,2121,"But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made some defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.",-3.3,-3,-4,-5,,,,,,,,,
2121,2122,"It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Fridayâs pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter.",-0.35,0,0,-3,,,,,,,,,
2122,2123,"As soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.",-0.15,0,-1,-1,,,,,,,,,

2124,2125,"FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR   But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest diversion imaginable.",-1.0,0,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
2125,2126,"As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions; first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss anything at him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honourâ""that is his first quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you.",-2.3,-1,9,-6,,,,,,,,,
2126,2127,"My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood; and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw.",-0.65,-1,-2,-1,,,,,,,,,

2133,2134,"The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand him.",0.25,0,1,-1,,,,,,,,,
2134,2135,"âHark ye, hark ye,â says Friday, âme speakee with you.â We followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there.",0.75,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,
2135,2136,"Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Fridayâs end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh as he called it.",-1.15,-2,-1,-3,,,,,,,,,
2136,2137,"As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop; away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own business another way; and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then ran away; and I called out, âYou dog!",-1.3,-3,-2,-1,,,,,,,,,

2138,2139,"Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature.â He heard me, and cried out, âNo shoot, no shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh:â and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bearâs one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree.",0.05,3,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
2139,2140,"The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the first thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous heavy.",-1.65,-3,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
2140,2141,"I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.",0.6,1,3,1,,,,,,,,,

2143,2144,"But Friday had not done with him by a great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, âWhat, you come no farther?",0.75,1,2,1,,,,,,,,,
2144,2145,"pray you come farther;â so he left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little farther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again.",-0.3,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,
2145,2146,"We thought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and called to Friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly, âOh, pray!",-0.15,1,1,2,,,,,,,,,

2148,2149,"However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last.",1.85,3,6,3,,,,,,,,,
2149,2150,"But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, âWell, well,â says Friday, âyou no come farther, me go; you no come to me, me come to you;â and upon this he went out to the smaller end, where it would bend with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still.",-1.1,2,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,

2152,2153,"At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead.",-1.65,-1,-3,-2,,,,,,,,,

2156,2157,"These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went forward on our journey.",2.4,0,2,3,,,,,,,,,
2157,2158,"The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some people too.",-2.0,-2,-5,-1,,,,,,,,,
2158,2159,"We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were more wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge.",-0.4,-2,-2,-1,,,,,,,,,
2159,2160,"It was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments.",0.6,1,2,-1,,,,,,,,,

2163,2164,"The first object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.",-1.75,-3,-8,0,,,,,,,,,

2166,2167,"We had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers.",-0.3,-1,0,-1,,,,,,,,,
2167,2168,"I scarce knew in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that those that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at present we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire.",-2.15,-2,-14,-1,,,,,,,,,

2169,2170,"I found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as they could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about.",-2.8,-3,-7,1,,,,,,,,,
2170,2171,"I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.",-0.5,0,-2,-1,,,,,,,,,
2171,2172,"This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we were to go.",0.8,-3,-4,-1,,,,,,,,,
2172,2173,"The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on a sudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard trot.",-1.15,-3,-3,-1,,,,,,,,,
2173,2174,"In this manner, we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance.",-0.5,-1,-2,1,,,,,,,,,
2174,2175,"On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed: the horse had the advantage of them; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at last: no question but they did.",0.05,1,1,2,,,,,,,,,
2175,2176,"But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and of two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body was eaten up.",-3.35,-2,-10,-3,,,,,,,,,
2176,2177,"This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them.",0.5,0,4,-1,,,,,,,,,
2177,2178,"It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage.",0.5,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,
2178,2179,"I drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.",0.0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,

2180,2181,"They came on with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us.",-1.1,-2,2,-3,,,,,,,,,
2181,2182,"I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before.",-1.85,0,-5,0,,,,,,,,,
2182,2183,"When we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again.",-0.8,-1,-6,1,,,,,,,,,
2183,2184,"I was loth to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were engagedâ""but, as I said, I called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I had him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train.",1.75,1,2,1,,,,,,,,,
2184,2185,"He did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell; or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire; we despatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the nightâ""for it was now very near darkâ""made more terrible that they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground, and fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our expectation, for the crying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled and left us.",-5.5,-5,-16,-5,,,,,,,,,

2188,2189,"In about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village, and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.",-2.3,-4,-9,-1,,,,,,,,,
2189,2190,"The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured.",2.35,2,6,4,,,,,,,,,
2190,2191,"When we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun; but being excessively hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger, and that if we had not by the continual fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal, they told us that at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off safe, especially having our firearms in our hands, being so many in number.",-5.1,-1,-12,-7,,,,,,,,,
2191,2192,"For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again: I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a-week.",-1.7,-2,-4,-3,,,,,,,,,
