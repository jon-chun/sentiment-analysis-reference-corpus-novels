"1","i was born in the year   in the city of york  of a good family  though not of that country  my father being a foreigner of bremen  who settled first at hull",0.5,1,3,0
"2","he got a good estate by merchandise  and leaving off his trade  lived afterwards at york  from whence he had married my mother  whose relations were named robinson  a very good family in that country  and from whom i was called robinson kreutznaer  but  by the usual corruption of words in england  we are now called nay we call ourselves and write our name crusoe  and so my companions always called me",0.4,0,0,-1
"3","i had two elder brothers  one of whom was lieutenant colonel to an english regiment of foot in flanders  formerly commanded by the famous colonel lockhart  and was killed at the battle near dunkirk against the spaniards",-0.1,0,-2,2
"4","what became of my second brother i never knew  any more than my father or mother knew what became of me",0.4,0,0,1
"5","being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade  my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts",-0.1,0,0,-1
"6","my father  who was very ancient  had given me a competent share of learning  as far as house education and a country free school generally go  and designed me for the law  but i would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea  and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will  nay  the commands of my father  and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends  that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature  tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me",3.3,1,1,1
"7","my father  a wise and grave man  gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design",1.4,2,1,2
"8","he called me one morning into his chamber  where he was confined by the gout  and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject",-0.3,0,0,-3
"9","he asked me what reasons  more than a mere wandering inclination  i had for leaving father s house and my native country  where i might be well introduced  and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry  with a life of ease and pleasure",3.75,4,8,3
"10","he told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand  or of aspiring  superior fortunes on the other  who went abroad upon adventures  to rise by enterprise  and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road  that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me  that mine was the middle state  or what might be called the upper station of low life  which he had found  by long experience  was the best state in the world  the most suited to human happiness  not exposed to the miseries and hardships  the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind  and not embarrassed with the pride  luxury  ambition  and envy of the upper part of mankind",2.35,4,10,6
"11","he told me i might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing viz  that this was the state of life which all other people envied  that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things  and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes  between the mean and the great  that the wise man gave his testimony to this  as the standard of felicity  when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches",0.5,2,2,1
"12","he bade me observe it  and i should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind  but that the middle station had the fewest disasters  and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind  nay  they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses  either of body or mind  as those were who  by vicious living  luxury  and extravagances on the one hand  or by hard labour  want of necessaries  and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand  bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living  that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments  that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune  that temperance  moderation  quietness  health  society  all agreeable diversions  and all desirable pleasures  were the blessings attending the middle station of life  that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world  and comfortably out of it  not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head  not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread  nor harassed with perplexed circumstances  which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest  nor enraged with the passion of envy  or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things  but  in easy circumstances  sliding gently through the world  and sensibly tasting the sweets of living  without the bitter  feeling that they are happy  and learning by every day s experience to know it more sensibly",3.35,4,4,6
"13","after this he pressed me earnestly  and in the most affectionate manner  not to play the young man  nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature  and the station of life i was born in  seemed to have provided against  that i was under no necessity of seeking my bread  that he would do well for me  and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me  and that if i was not very easy and happy in the world  it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it  and that he should have nothing to answer for  having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt  in a word  that as he would do very kind things for me if i would stay and settle at home as he directed  so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away  and to close all  he told me i had my elder brother for an example  to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the low country wars  but could not prevail  his young desires prompting him to run into the army  where he was killed  and though he said he would not cease to pray for me  yet he would venture to say to me  that if i did take this foolish step  god would not bless me  and i should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery",3.35,1,2,13
"14","i observed in this last part of his discourse  which was truly prophetic  though i suppose my father did not know it to be so himself i say  i observed the tears run down his face very plentifully  especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed  and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent  and none to assist me  he was so moved that he broke off the discourse  and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me",-0.45,-2,-7,3
"15","i was sincerely affected with this discourse  and  indeed  who could be otherwise",0.5,1,1,0
"16","and i resolved not to think of going abroad any more  but to settle at home according to my father s desire",1.2,0,3,0
"17","but alas  a few days wore it all off  and  in short  to prevent any of my father s further importunities  in a few weeks after i resolved to run quite away from him",-0.05,0,0,0
"18","however  i did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted  but i took my mother at a time when i thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary  and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that i should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it  and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it  that i was now eighteen years old  which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney  that i was sure if i did i should never serve out my time  but i should certainly run away from my master before my time was out  and go to sea  and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad  if i came home again  and did not like it  i would go no more  and i would promise  by a double diligence  to recover the time that i had lost",2.45,5,8,2
"19","this put my mother into a great passion  she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject  that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt  and that she wondered how i could think of any such thing after the discourse i had had with my father  and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me  and that  in short  if i would ruin myself  there was no help for me  but i might depend i should never have their consent to it  that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction  and i should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not",2.9,2,5,0
"20","though my mother refused to move it to my father  yet i heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him  and that my father  after showing a great concern at it  said to her  with a sigh  that boy might be happy if he would stay at home  but if he goes abroad  he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born  i can give no consent to it",-0.95,-2,0,-3
"21","it was not till almost a year after this that i broke loose  though  in the meantime  i continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business  and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to",-1.05,-3,0,-1
"22","but being one day at hull  where i went casually  and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time  but  i say  being there  and one of my companions being about to sail to london in his father s ship  and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men  that it should cost me nothing for my passage  i consulted neither father nor mother any more  nor so much as sent them word of it  but leaving them to hear of it as they might  without asking god s blessing or my father s  without any consideration of circumstances or consequences  and in an ill hour  god knows  on the st of september   i went on board a ship bound for london",-0.8,1,2,1
"23","never any young adventurer s misfortunes  i believe  began sooner  or continued longer than mine",-0.6,0,0,1
"24","the ship was no sooner out of the humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner  and  as i had never been at sea before  i was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind",-2.65,-3,-5,-1
"25","i began now seriously to reflect upon what i had done  and how justly i was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father s house  and abandoning my duty",0.25,2,0,-1
"26","all the good counsels of my parents  my father s tears and my mother s entreaties  came now fresh into my mind  and my conscience  which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since  reproached me with the contempt of advice  and the breach of my duty to god and my father",-1.05,0,-1,0
"27","all this while the storm increased  and the sea went very high  though nothing like what i have seen many times since  no  nor what i saw a few days after  but it was enough to affect me then  who was but a young sailor  and had never known anything of the matter",0.9,2,3,1
"28","i expected every wave would have swallowed us up  and that every time the ship fell down  as i thought it did  in the trough or hollow of the sea  we should never rise more  in this agony of mind  i made many vows and resolutions that if it would please god to spare my life in this one voyage  if ever i got once my foot upon dry land again  i would go directly home to my father  and never set it into a ship again while i lived  that i would take his advice  and never run myself into such miseries as these any more",-0.4,-4,2,0
"29","now i saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life  how easy  how comfortably he had lived all his days  and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore  and i resolved that i would  like a true repenting prodigal  go home to my father",3.15,3,9,2
"30","these wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted  and indeed some time after  but the next day the wind was abated  and the sea calmer  and i began to be a little inured to it  however  i was very grave for all that day  being also a little sea sick still  but towards night the weather cleared up  the wind was quite over  and a charming fine evening followed  the sun went down perfectly clear  and rose so the next morning  and having little or no wind  and a smooth sea  the sun shining upon it  the sight was  as i thought  the most delightful that ever i saw",4.3,6,9,3
"31","i had slept well in the night  and was now no more sea sick  but very cheerful  looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before  and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after",1.55,2,1,2
"32","and now  lest my good resolutions should continue  my companion  who had enticed me away  comes to me  well  bob  says he  clapping me upon the shoulder  how do you do after it",2.45,3,3,4
"33","i warrant you were frighted  wer n t you  last night  when it blew but a capful of wind",0,0,0,0
"34","a capful d you call it",0,0,0,0
"35","said i  it was a terrible storm",-1,-1,-3,-2
"36","a storm  you fool you  replies he  do you call that a storm",-1,-1,-2,-2
"37","why  it was nothing at all  give us but a good ship and sea room  and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that  but you re but a fresh water sailor  bob",0.25,2,4,1
"38","come  let us make a bowl of punch  and we ll forget all that  d ye see what charming weather it is now",0,0,2,-1
"39","to make short this sad part of my story  we went the way of all sailors  the punch was made and i was made half drunk with it  and in that one night s wickedness i drowned all my repentance  all my reflections upon my past conduct  all my resolutions for the future",-2.8,-4,-6,-2
"40","in a word  as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm  so the hurry of my thoughts being over  my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten  and the current of my former desires returned  i entirely forgot the vows and promises that i made in my distress",-1.05,-1,-3,0
"41","i found  indeed  some intervals of reflection  and the serious thoughts did  as it were  endeavour to return again sometimes  but i shook them off  and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper  and applying myself to drinking and company  soon mastered the return of those fits for so i called them  and i had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire",2.6,0,4,3
"42","but i was to have another trial for it still  and providence  as in such cases generally it does  resolved to leave me entirely without excuse  for if i would not take this for a deliverance  the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of",-1.4,-4,-3,-3
"43","the sixth day of our being at sea we came into yarmouth roads  the wind having been contrary and the weather calm  we had made but little way since the storm",-0.1,1,2,0
"44","here we were obliged to come to an anchor  and here we lay  the wind continuing contrary viz  at south west for seven or eight days  during which time a great many ships from newcastle came into the same roads  as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river",0.05,1,3,-1
"45","we had not  however  rid here so long but we should have tided it up the river  but that the wind blew too fresh  and after we had lain four or five days  blew very hard",0.25,0,0,0
"46","however  the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour  the anchorage good  and our ground tackle very strong  our men were unconcerned  and not in the least apprehensive of danger  but spent the time in rest and mirth  after the manner of the sea  but the eighth day  in the morning  the wind increased  and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts  and make everything snug and close  that the ship might ride as easy as possible",0.05,1,3,1
"47","by noon the sea went very high indeed  and our ship rode forecastle in  shipped several seas  and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home  upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor  so that we rode with two anchors ahead  and the cables veered out to the bitter end",0.3,0,-2,4
"48","by this time it blew a terrible storm indeed  and now i began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves",-1.2,-1,-6,-3
"49","the master  though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship  yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me  i could hear him softly to himself say  several times  lord be merciful to us  we shall be all lost  we shall be all undone  and the like",0.5,2,2,2
"50","during these first hurries i was stupid  lying still in my cabin  which was in the steerage  and cannot describe my temper  i could ill resume the first penitence which i had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against  i thought the bitterness of death had been past  and that this would be nothing like the first  but when the master himself came by me  as i said just now  and said we should be all lost  i was dreadfully frighted",-5.5,-6,-7,-7
"51","i got up out of my cabin and looked out  but such a dismal sight i never saw  the sea ran mountains high  and broke upon us every three or four minutes  when i could look about  i could see nothing but distress round us  two ships that rode near us  we found  had cut their masts by the board  being deep laden  and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered",-2.6,-3,-8,-1
"52","two more ships  being driven from their anchors  were run out of the roads to sea  at all adventures  and that with not a mast standing",0.25,0,2,2
"53","the light ships fared the best  as not so much labouring in the sea  but two or three of them drove  and came close by us  running away with only their spritsail out before the wind",0.5,1,3,1
"54","towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore mast  which he was very unwilling to do  but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder  he consented  and when they had cut away the fore mast  the main mast stood so loose  and shook the ship so much  they were obliged to cut that away also  and make a clear deck",0.1,-1,-5,4
"55","any one may judge what a condition i must be in at all this  who was but a young sailor  and who had been in such a fright before at but a little",-0.35,-1,-2,0
"56","but if i can express at this distance the thoughts i had about me at that time  i was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions  and the having returned from them to the resolutions i had wickedly taken at first  than i was at death itself  and these  added to the terror of the storm  put me into such a condition that i can by no words describe it",-4,-3,-6,-5
"57","but the worst was not come yet  the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse",-2,-3,-6,-3
"58","we had a good ship  but she was deep laden  and wallowed in the sea  so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder",-0.1,1,1,1
"59","it was my advantage in one respect  that i did not know what they meant by  founder  till i inquired",1.65,2,4,2
"60","however  the storm was so violent that i saw  what is not often seen  the master  the boatswain  and some others more sensible than the rest  at their prayers  and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom",-0.2,1,-3,-1
"61","in the middle of the night  and under all the rest of our distresses  one of the men that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a leak  another said there was four feet water in the hold",-2.75,-1,-5,0
"62","then all hands were called to the pump",0,0,0,0
"63","at that word  my heart  as i thought  died within me  and i fell backwards upon the side of my bed where i sat  into the cabin",-1.4,-2,-3,-1
"64","however  the men roused me  and told me that i  that was able to do nothing before  was as well able to pump as another  at which i stirred up and went to the pump  and worked very heartily",1.55,3,0,1
"65","while this was doing the master  seeing some light colliers  who  not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and run away to sea  and would come near us  ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress",-2.25,0,-6,-2
"66","i  who knew nothing what they meant  thought the ship had broken  or some dreadful thing happened",-1.5,-2,-4,-2
"67","in a word  i was so surprised that i fell down in a swoon",-0.5,-1,0,0
"68","as this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of  nobody minded me  or what was become of me  but another man stepped up to the pump  and thrusting me aside with his foot  let me lie  thinking i had been dead  and it was a great while before i came to myself",-1.4,-1,0,-1
"69","we worked on  but the water increasing in the hold  it was apparent that the ship would founder  and though the storm began to abate a little  yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port  so the master continued firing guns for help  and a light ship  who had rid it out just ahead of us  ventured a boat out to help us",0.6,2,0,2
"70","it was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us  but it was impossible for us to get on board  or for the boat to lie near the ship s side  till at last the men rowing very heartily  and venturing their lives to save ours  our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it  and then veered it out a great length  which they  after much labour and hazard  took hold of  and we hauled them close under our stern  and got all into their boat",-0.35,-2,5,-1
"71","it was to no purpose for them or us  after we were in the boat  to think of reaching their own ship  so all agreed to let her drive  and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could  and our master promised them  that if the boat was staved upon shore  he would make it good to their master  so partly rowing and partly driving  our boat went away to the northward  sloping towards the shore almost as far as winterton ness",1.75,3,5,4
"72","we were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink  and then i understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea",-0.25,-1,0,1
"73","i must acknowledge i had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking  for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that i might be said to go in  my heart was  as it were  dead within me  partly with fright  partly with horror of mind  and the thoughts of what was yet before me",-3,-3,-5,-2
"74","while we were in this condition the men yet labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore we could see  when  our boat mounting the waves  we were able to see the shore  a great many people running along the strand to assist us when we should come near  but we made but slow way towards the shore  nor were we able to reach the shore till  being past the lighthouse at winterton  the shore falls off to the westward towards cromer  and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind",0.15,-2,0,1
"75","here we got in  and though not without much difficulty  got all safe on shore  and walked afterwards on foot to yarmouth  where  as unfortunate men  we were used with great humanity  as well by the magistrates of the town  who assigned us good quarters  as by particular merchants and owners of ships  and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to london or back to hull as we thought fit",3.8,3,8,2
"76","had i now had the sense to have gone back to hull  and have gone home  i had been happy  and my father  as in our blessed saviour s parable  had even killed the fatted calf for me  for hearing the ship i went away in was cast away in yarmouth roads  it was a great while before he had any assurances that i was not drowned",1.75,2,1,3
"77","but my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist  and though i had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home  yet i had no power to do it",-0.2,-1,-3,-2
"78","i know not what to call this  nor will i urge that it is a secret overruling decree  that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction  even though it be before us  and that we rush upon it with our eyes open",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"79","certainly  nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery  which it was impossible for me to escape  could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts  and against two such visible instructions as i had met with in my first attempt",-0.65,-1,-1,-1
"80","my comrade  who had helped to harden me before  and who was the master s son  was now less forward than i",2.15,1,0,3
"81","the first time he spoke to me after we were at yarmouth  which was not till two or three days  for we were separated in the town to several quarters  i say  the first time he saw me  it appeared his tone was altered  and  looking very melancholy  and shaking his head  he asked me how i did  and telling his father who i was  and how i had come this voyage only for a trial  in order to go further abroad  his father  turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone young man  says he  you ought never to go to sea any more  you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man",-1.45,-2,-6,-2
"82","why  sir  said i  will you go to sea no more",0.25,0,-1,2
"83","that is another case  said he  it is my calling  and therefore my duty  but as you made this voyage on trial  you see what a taste heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist",1.2,1,2,0
"84","perhaps this has all befallen us on your account  like jonah in the ship of tarshish",0.5,1,2,0
"85","pray  continues he  what are you  and on what account did you go to sea",0.1,0,1,2
"86","upon that i told him some of my story  at the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion  what had i done  says he  that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship",-0.75,-2,0,0
"87","i would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds",0,0,0,0
"88","this indeed was  as i said  an excursion of his spirits  which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss  and was farther than he could have authority to go",-0.5,-1,-2,1
"89","however  he afterwards talked very gravely to me  exhorting me to go back to my father  and not tempt providence to my ruin  telling me i might see a visible hand of heaven against me",-0.6,1,0,-1
"90","and  young man  said he  depend upon it  if you do not go back  wherever you go  you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments  till your father s words are fulfilled upon you",-0.55,-1,-2,0
"91","we parted soon after  for i made him little answer  and i saw him no more  which way he went i knew not",0,0,-1,0
"92","as for me  having some money in my pocket  i travelled to london by land  and there  as well as on the road  had many struggles with myself what course of life i should take  and whether i should go home or to sea",0.9,0,-2,3
"93","as to going home  shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts  and it immediately occurred to me how i should be laughed at among the neighbours  and should be ashamed to see  not my father and mother only  but even everybody else  from whence i have since often observed  how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is  especially of youth  to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases viz  that they are not ashamed to sin  and yet are ashamed to repent  not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools  but are ashamed of the returning  which only can make them be esteemed wise men",-0.1,-3,-3,0
"94","in this state of life  however  i remained some time  uncertain what measures to take  and what course of life to lead",-0.5,0,-1,0
"95","an irresistible reluctance continued to going home  and as i stayed away a while  the remembrance of the distress i had been in wore off  and as that abated  the little motion i had in my desires to return wore off with it  till at last i quite laid aside the thoughts of it  and looked out for a voyage",-1.05,-1,0,-1
"96","that evil influence which carried me first away from my father s house which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune  and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me deaf to all good advice  and to the entreaties and even the commands of my father i say  the same influence  whatever it was  presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view  and i went on board a vessel bound to the coast of africa  or  as our sailors vulgarly called it  a voyage to guinea",-1.2,-1,5,-3
"97","it was my great misfortune that in all these adventures i did not ship myself as a sailor  when  though i might indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary  yet at the same time i should have learnt the duty and office of a fore mast man  and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant  if not for a master",1.35,3,3,3
"98","but as it was always my fate to choose for the worse  so i did here  for having money in my pocket and good clothes upon my back  i would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman  and so i neither had any business in the ship  nor learned to do any",1.35,0,0,1
"99","it was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in london  which does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as i then was  the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them very early  but it was not so with me  i first got acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of guinea  and who  having had very good success there  was resolved to go again",1.6,-1,5,2
"100","this captain taking a fancy to my conversation  which was not at all disagreeable at that time  hearing me say i had a mind to see the world  told me if i would go the voyage with him i should be at no expense  i should be his messmate and his companion  and if i could carry anything with me  i should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit  and perhaps i might meet with some encouragement",2.1,2,0,4
"101","i embraced the offer  and entering into a strict friendship with this captain  who was an honest  plain dealing man  i went the voyage with him  and carried a small adventure with me  which  by the disinterested honesty of my friend the captain  i increased very considerably  for i carried about in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy",2.75,0,8,5
"102","these i had mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom i corresponded with  and who  i believe  got my father  or at least my mother  to contribute so much as that to my first adventure",2.1,0,2,3
"103","this was the only voyage which i may say was successful in all my adventures  which i owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain  under whom also i got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation  learned how to keep an account of the ship s course  take an observation  and  in short  to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor  for  as he took delight to instruct me  i took delight to learn  and  in a word  this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant  for i brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure  which yielded me in london  at my return  almost   and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin",6.85,2,15,11
"104","yet even in this voyage i had my misfortunes too  particularly  that i was continually sick  being thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the climate  our principal trading being upon the coast  from latitude of degrees north even to the line itself",-2.3,-3,-5,0
"105","i was now set up for a guinea trader  and my friend  to my great misfortune  dying soon after his arrival  i resolved to go the same voyage again  and i embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former voyage  and had now got the command of the ship",1.25,-1,1,0
"106","this was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made  for though i did not carry quite of my new gained wealth  so that i had left  which i had lodged with my friend s widow  who was very just to me  yet i fell into terrible misfortunes",0.35,-1,3,0
"107","the first was this  our ship making her course towards the canary islands  or rather between those islands and the african shore  was surprised in the grey of the morning by a turkish rover of sallee  who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make",0,0,-1,0
"108","we crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread  or our masts carry  to get clear  but finding the pirate gained upon us  and would certainly come up with us in a few hours  we prepared to fight  our ship having twelve guns  and the rogue eighteen",-0.2,0,3,-2
"109","about three in the afternoon he came up with us  and bringing to  by mistake  just athwart our quarter  instead of athwart our stern  as he intended  we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side  and poured in a broadside upon him  which made him sheer off again  after returning our fire  and pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on board",-2.4,-2,-4,-4
"110","however  we had not a man touched  all our men keeping close",0.25,0,0,-1
"111","he prepared to attack us again  and we to defend ourselves",0,-1,0,1
"112","but laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter  he entered sixty men upon our decks  who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging",-0.5,-1,-1,-2
"113","we plied them with small shot  half pikes  powder chests  and such like  and cleared our deck of them twice",0.6,2,3,-2
"114","however  to cut short this melancholy part of our story  our ship being disabled  and three of our men killed  and eight wounded  we were obliged to yield  and were carried all prisoners into sallee  a port belonging to the moors",-3.05,-3,-8,-2
"115","the usage i had there was not so dreadful as at first i apprehended  nor was i carried up the country to the emperor s court  as the rest of our men were  but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize  and made his slave  being young and nimble  and fit for his business",1,1,-5,2
"116","at this surprising change of my circumstances  from a merchant to a miserable slave  i was perfectly overwhelmed  and now i looked back upon my father s prophetic discourse to me  that i should be miserable and have none to relieve me  which i thought was now so effectually brought to pass that i could not be worse  for now the hand of heaven had overtaken me  and i was undone without redemption  but  alas  this was but a taste of the misery i was to go through  as will appear in the sequel of this story",-2.9,-2,-6,-4
"117","as my new patron  or master  had taken me home to his house  so i was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again  believing that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a spanish or portugal man of war  and that then i should be set at liberty",2.05,2,0,3
"118","but this hope of mine was soon taken away  for when he went to sea  he left me on shore to look after his little garden  and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house  and when he came home again from his cruise  he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship",-1.4,-2,-3,1
"119","here i meditated nothing but my escape  and what method i might take to effect it  but found no way that had the least probability in it  nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational  for i had nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me no fellow slave  no englishman  irishman  or scotchman there but myself  so that for two years  though i often pleased myself with the imagination  yet i never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice",4.45,2,1,6
"120","after about two years  an odd circumstance presented itself  which put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head",0.25,0,-2,1
"121","my patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship  which  as i heard  was for want of money  he used constantly  once or twice a week  sometimes oftener if the weather was fair  to take the ship s pinnace and go out into the road a fishing  and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat  we made him very merry  and i proved very dexterous in catching fish  insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor  one of his kinsmen  and the youth the maresco  as they called him to catch a dish of fish for him",3.95,2,6,6
"122","it happened one time  that going a fishing in a calm morning  a fog rose so thick that  though we were not half a league from the shore  we lost sight of it  and rowing we knew not whither or which way  we laboured all day  and all the next night  and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore  and that we were at least two leagues from the shore",0.85,0,0,3
"123","however  we got well in again  though with a great deal of labour and some danger  for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning  but we were all very hungry",1.4,2,3,0
"124","but our patron  warned by this disaster  resolved to take more care of himself for the future  and having lying by him the longboat of our english ship that he had taken  he resolved he would not go a fishing any more without a compass and some provision  so he ordered the carpenter of his ship  who also was an english slave  to build a little state room  or cabin  in the middle of the long boat  like that of a barge  with a place to stand behind it to steer  and haul home the main sheet  the room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails",0.2,-2,-1,0
"125","she sailed with what we call a shoulder of mutton sail  and the boom jibed over the top of the cabin  which lay very snug and low  and had in it room for him to lie  with a slave or two  and a table to eat on  with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink  and his bread  rice  and coffee",-0.65,0,0,-1
"126","we went frequently out with this boat a fishing  and as i was most dexterous to catch fish for him  he never went without me",0.4,1,0,0
"127","it happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat  either for pleasure or for fish  with two or three moors of some distinction in that place  and for whom he had provided extraordinarily  and had  therefore  sent on board the boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary  and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot  which were on board his ship  for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing",3,5,3,1
"128","i got all things ready as he had directed  and waited the next morning with the boat washed clean  her ancient and pendants out  and everything to accommodate his guests  when by and by my patron came on board alone  and told me his guests had put off going from some business that fell out  and ordered me  with the man and boy  as usual  to go out with the boat and catch them some fish  for that his friends were to sup at his house  and commanded that as soon as i got some fish i should bring it home to his house  all which i prepared to do",1.95,1,1,1
"129","this moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts  for now i found i was likely to have a little ship at my command  and my master being gone  i prepared to furnish myself  not for fishing business  but for a voyage  though i knew not  neither did i so much as consider  whither i should steer anywhere to get out of that place was my desire",2.1,1,2,4
"130","my first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this moor  to get something for our subsistence on board  for i told him we must not presume to eat of our patron s bread",0.7,-1,0,2
"131","he said that was true  so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit  and three jars of fresh water  into the boat",1,1,3,1
"132","i knew where my patron s case of bottles stood  which it was evident  by the make  were taken out of some english prize  and i conveyed them into the boat while the moor was on shore  as if they had been there before for our master",1.4,2,0,2
"133","i conveyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat  which weighed about half a hundred weight  with a parcel of twine or thread  a hatchet  a saw  and a hammer  all of which were of great use to us afterwards  especially the wax  to make candles",0.5,1,3,-1
"134","another trick i tried upon him  which he innocently came into also  his name was ismael  which they call muley  or moely  so i called to him moely  said i  our patron s guns are on board the boat  can you not get a little powder and shot",2.77555756156289e-17,-1,0,0
"135","it may be we may kill some alcamies  a fowl like our curlews  for ourselves  for i know he keeps the gunner s stores in the ship",-0.25,0,-1,-1
"136","yes  says he  i ll bring some  and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch  which held a pound and a half of powder  or rather more  and another with shot  that had five or six pounds  with some bullets  and put all into the boat",1.15,1,4,-2
"137","at the same time i had found some powder of my master s in the great cabin  with which i filled one of the large bottles in the case  which was almost empty  pouring what was in it into another  and thus furnished with everything needful  we sailed out of the port to fish",0.85,2,2,0
"138","the castle  which is at the entrance of the port  knew who we were  and took no notice of us  and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish",0,0,-1,0
"139","the wind blew from the n n e   which was contrary to my desire  for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain  and at least reached to the bay of cadiz  but my resolutions were  blow which way it would  i would be gone from that horrid place where i was  and leave the rest to fate",-0.8,-2,-2,-2
"140","after we had fished some time and caught nothing for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up  that he might not see them i said to the moor  this will not do  our master will not be thus served  we must stand farther off",0,1,0,2
"141","he  thinking no harm  agreed  and being in the head of the boat  set the sails  and  as i had the helm  i ran the boat out near a league farther  and then brought her to  as if i would fish  when  giving the boy the helm  i stepped forward to where the moor was  and making as if i stooped for something behind him  i took him by surprise with my arm under his waist  and tossed him clear overboard into the sea",2.2,0,-1,4
"142","he rose immediately  for he swam like a cork  and called to me  begged to be taken in  told me he would go all over the world with me",0.5,1,3,0
"143","he swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me very quickly  there being but little wind  upon which i stepped into the cabin  and fetching one of the fowling pieces  i presented it at him  and told him i had done him no hurt  and if he would be quiet i would do him none",0,1,0,0
"144","but  said i  you swim well enough to reach to the shore  and the sea is calm  make the best of your way to shore  and i will do you no harm  but if you come near the boat i ll shoot you through the head  for i am resolved to have my liberty  so he turned himself about  and swam for the shore  and i make no doubt but he reached it with ease  for he was an excellent swimmer",2.65,5,9,3
"145","i could have been content to have taken this moor with me  and have drowned the boy  but there was no venturing to trust him",0.55,1,-2,0
"146","when he was gone  i turned to the boy  whom they called xury  and said to him  xury  if you will be faithful to me  i ll make you a great man  but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me that is  swear by mahomet and his father s beard i must throw you into the sea too",1.65,2,6,2
"147","the boy smiled in my face  and spoke so innocently that i could not distrust him  and swore to be faithful to me  and go all over the world with me",1.85,0,2,-1
"148","while i was in view of the moor that was swimming  i stood out directly to sea with the boat  rather stretching to windward  that they might think me gone towards the straits mouth  as indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been supposed to do   for who would have supposed we were sailed on to the southward  to the truly barbarian coast  where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and destroy us  where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts  or more merciless savages of human kind",-1.7,-5,-1,0
"149","but as soon as it grew dusk in the evening  i changed my course  and steered directly south and by east  bending my course a little towards the east  that i might keep in with the shore  and having a fair  fresh gale of wind  and a smooth  quiet sea  i made such sail that i believe by the next day  at three o clock in the afternoon  when i first made the land  i could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of sallee  quite beyond the emperor of morocco s dominions  or indeed of any other king thereabouts  for we saw no people",2.2,4,2,5
"150","yet such was the fright i had taken of the moors  and the dreadful apprehensions i had of falling into their hands  that i would not stop  or go on shore  or come to an anchor  the wind continuing fair till i had sailed in that manner five days  and then the wind shifting to the southward  i concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of me  they also would now give over  so i ventured to make to the coast  and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river  i knew not what  nor where  neither what latitude  what country  what nation  or what river",-1.9,-3,-5,-1
"151","i neither saw  nor desired to see any people  the principal thing i wanted was fresh water",1.7,1,3,1
"152","we came into this creek in the evening  resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark  and discover the country  but as soon as it was quite dark  we heard such dreadful noises of the barking  roaring  and howling of wild creatures  of we knew not what kinds  that the poor boy was ready to die with fear  and begged of me not to go on shore till day",-1.95,-6,-8,-4
"153","well  xury  said i  then i won t  but it may be that we may see men by day  who will be as bad to us as those lions",0.55,1,0,-1
"154","then we give them the shoot gun  says xury  laughing  make them run wey",-0.4,0,-1,-1
"155","such english xury spoke by conversing among us slaves",-1,-1,-3,-1
"156","however  i was glad to see the boy so cheerful  and i gave him a dram  out of our patron s case of bottles  to cheer him up",2.6,3,7,2
"157","after all  xury s advice was good  and i took it  we dropped our little anchor  and lay still all night  i say still  for we slept none  for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures  we knew not what to call them  of many sorts  come down to the sea shore and run into the water  wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves  and they made such hideous howlings and yellings  that i never indeed heard the like",1.5,3,7,2
"158","xury was dreadfully frighted  and indeed so was i too  but we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming towards our boat  we could not see him  but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast",-1.75,-2,-2,-2
"159","xury said it was a lion  and it might be so for aught i know  but poor xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away  no  says i  xury  we can slip our cable  with the buoy to it  and go off to sea  they cannot follow us far",-1.65,-1,-6,2
"160","i had no sooner said so  but i perceived the creature  whatever it was  within two oars length  which something surprised me  however  i immediately stepped to the cabin door  and taking up my gun  fired at him  upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore again",-1.25,0,-4,-2
"161","but it is impossible to describe the horrid noises  and hideous cries and howlings that were raised  as well upon the edge of the shore as higher within the country  upon the noise or report of the gun  a thing i have some reason to believe those creatures had never heard before  this convinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night on that coast  and how to venture on shore in the day was another question too  for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of the lions and tigers  at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it",-3.8,-9,-18,-4
"162","be that as it would  we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other for water  for we had not a pint left in the boat  when and where to get to it was the point",0,0,0,0
"163","xury said  if i would let him go on shore with one of the jars  he would find if there was any water  and bring some to me  i asked him why he would go",0,0,0,0
"164","why i should not go  and he stay in the boat",0,0,0,0
"165","the boy answered with so much affection as made me love him ever after",2,2,6,1
"166","says he  if wild mans come  they eat me  you go wey",0.35,-1,0,0
"167","well  xury  said i  we will both go and if the wild mans come  we will kill them  they shall eat neither of us",0.4,-1,-3,-1
"168","so i gave xury a piece of rusk bread to eat  and a dram out of our patron s case of bottles which i mentioned before  and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper  and so waded on shore  carrying nothing but our arms and two jars for water",1.2,1,0,2
"169","i did not care to go out of sight of the boat  fearing the coming of canoes with savages down the river  but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country  rambled to it  and by and by i saw him come running towards me  i thought he was pursued by some savage  or frighted with some wild beast  and i ran forward towards him to help him  but when i came nearer to him i saw something hanging over his shoulders  which was a creature that he had shot  like a hare  but different in colour  and longer legs  however  we were very glad of it  and it was very good meat  but the great joy that poor xury came with  was to tell me he had found good water and seen no wild mans",1.05,1,13,-3
"170","but we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water  for a little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the tide was out  which flowed but a little way up  so we filled our jars  and feasted on the hare he had killed  and prepared to go on our way  having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country",0.7,-1,-2,0
"171","as i had been one voyage to this coast before  i knew very well that the islands of the canaries  and the cape de verde islands also  lay not far off from the coast",1.4,1,0,1
"172","but as i had no instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we were in  and not exactly knowing  or at least remembering  what latitude they were in  i knew not where to look for them  or when to stand off to sea towards them  otherwise i might now easily have found some of these islands",1.2,0,-1,3
"173","but my hope was  that if i stood along this coast till i came to that part where the english traded  i should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade  that would relieve and take us in",2.5,0,3,3
"174","by the best of my calculation  that place where i now was must be that country which  lying between the emperor of morocco s dominions and the negroes  lies waste and uninhabited  except by wild beasts  the negroes having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the moors  and the moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness  and indeed  both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers  lions  leopards  and other furious creatures which harbour there  so that the moors use it for their hunting only  where they go like an army  two or three thousand men at a time  and indeed for near a hundred miles together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste  uninhabited country by day  and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night",-1.3,-2,-1,-3
"175","once or twice in the daytime i thought i saw the pico of teneriffe  being the high top of the mountain teneriffe in the canaries  and had a great mind to venture out  in hopes of reaching thither  but having tried twice  i was forced in again by contrary winds  the sea also going too high for my little vessel  so  i resolved to pursue my first design  and keep along the shore",0.6,2,9,0
"176","several times i was obliged to land for fresh water  after we had left this place  and once in particular  being early in morning  we came to an anchor under a little point of land  which was pretty high  and the tide beginning to flow  we lay still to go farther in",1.25,2,2,4
"177","xury  whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were  calls softly to me  and tells me that we had best go farther off the shore  for  says he  look  yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock  fast asleep",-1.75,-1,0,-3
"178","i looked where he pointed  and saw a dreadful monster indeed  for it was a terrible  great lion that lay on the side of the shore  under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him",-1.4,-3,-3,-2
"179","xury  says i  you shall on shore and kill him",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"180","xury  looked frighted  and said  me kill  he eat me at one mouth  one mouthful he meant",-0.15,-1,-3,0
"181","however  i said no more to the boy  but bade him lie still  and i took our biggest gun  which was almost musket bore  and loaded it with a good charge of powder  and with two slugs  and laid it down  then i loaded another gun with two bullets  and the third  for we had three pieces  i loaded with five smaller bullets",-0.75,-1,-1,-3
"182","i took the best aim i could with the first piece to have shot him in the head  but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose  that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the bone",-0.9,0,2,-3
"183","he started up  growling at first  but finding his leg broken  fell down again  and then got upon three legs  and gave the most hideous roar that ever i heard",-2.6,-3,-4,-4
"184","i was a little surprised that i had not hit him on the head  however  i took up the second piece immediately  and though he began to move off  fired again  and shot him in the head  and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise  but lie struggling for life",-1.65,-2,-2,-4
"185","then xury took heart  and would have me let him go on shore",0,0,0,0
"186","well  go  said i  so the boy jumped into the water and taking a little gun in one hand  swam to shore with the other hand  and coming close to the creature  put the muzzle of the piece to his ear  and shot him in the head again  which despatched him quite",-0.6,1,-1,-5
"187","this was game indeed to us  but this was no food  and i was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to us",-0.25,-1,-1,-1
"188","however  xury said he would have some of him  so he comes on board  and asked me to give him the hatchet",0,0,0,0
"189","for what  xury",0,0,0,0
"190","said i  me cut off his head  said he",-0.25,0,-1,0
"191","however  xury could not cut off his head  but he cut off a foot  and brought it with him  and it was a monstrous great one",-0.25,0,2,0
"192","i bethought myself  however  that  perhaps the skin of him might  one way or other  be of some value to us  and i resolved to take off his skin if i could",0.6,0,2,0
"193","so xury and i went to work with him  but xury was much the better workman at it  for i knew very ill how to do it",0.55,2,0,-1
"194","indeed  it took us both up the whole day  but at last we got off the hide of him  and spreading it on the top of our cabin  the sun effectually dried it in two days time  and it afterwards served me to lie upon",0.1,0,1,1
"195","after this stop  we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days  living very sparingly on our provisions  which began to abate very much  and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water",0.1,1,-1,0
"196","my design in this was to make the river gambia or senegal  that is to say anywhere about the cape de verde  where i was in hopes to meet with some european ship  and if i did not  i knew not what course i had to take  but to seek for the islands  or perish there among the negroes",0.1,-1,2,-1
"197","i knew that all the ships from europe  which sailed either to the coast of guinea or to brazil  or to the east indies  made this cape  or those islands  and  in a word  i put the whole of my fortune upon this single point  either that i must meet with some ship or must perish",0.6,0,2,2
"198","when i had pursued this resolution about ten days longer  as i have said  i began to see that the land was inhabited  and in two or three places  as we sailed by  we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us  we could also perceive they were quite black and naked",-0.5,0,2,1
"199","i was once inclined to have gone on shore to them  but xury was my better counsellor  and said to me  no go  no go",1.2,1,1,-1
"200","however  i hauled in nearer the shore that i might talk to them  and i found they ran along the shore by me a good way",1.75,1,3,3
"201","i observed they had no weapons in their hand  except one  who had a long slender stick  which xury said was a lance  and that they could throw them a great way with good aim  so i kept at a distance  but talked with them by signs as well as i could  and particularly made signs for something to eat  they beckoned to me to stop my boat  and they would fetch me some meat",3.35,4,4,3
"202","upon this i lowered the top of my sail and lay by  and two of them ran up into the country  and in less than half an hour came back  and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn  such as is the produce of their country  but we neither knew what the one or the other was  however  we were willing to accept it  but how to come at it was our next dispute  for i would not venture on shore to them  and they were as much afraid of us  but they took a safe way for us all  for they brought it to the shore and laid it down  and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board  and then came close to us again",1.55,2,3,0
"203","we made signs of thanks to them  for we had nothing to make them amends  but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully  for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures  one pursuing the other  as we took it  with great fury from the mountains towards the sea  whether it was the male pursuing the female  or whether they were in sport or in rage  we could not tell  any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange  but i believe it was the latter  because  in the first place  those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night  and  in the second place  we found the people terribly frighted  especially the women",1.4,-2,5,3
"204","the man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them  but the rest did  however  as the two creatures ran directly into the water  they did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes  but plunged themselves into the sea  and swam about  as if they had come for their diversion  at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first i expected  but i lay ready for him  for i had loaded my gun with all possible expedition  and bade xury load both the others",0.5,0,-1,3
"205","as soon as he came fairly within my reach  i fired  and shot him directly in the head  immediately he sank down into the water  but rose instantly  and plunged up and down  as if he were struggling for life  and so indeed he was  he immediately made to the shore  but between the wound  which was his mortal hurt  and the strangling of the water  he died just before he reached the shore",-4.15,-2,-6,-3
"206","it is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun  some of them were even ready to die for fear  and fell down as dead with the very terror  but when they saw the creature dead  and sunk in the water  and that i made signs to them to come to the shore  they took heart and came  and began to search for the creature",-5.2,-7,-16,-8
"207","i found him by his blood staining the water  and by the help of a rope  which i slung round him  and gave the negroes to haul  they dragged him on shore  and found that it was a most curious leopard  spotted  and fine to an admirable degree  and the negroes held up their hands with admiration  to think what it was i had killed him with",1.5,1,1,4
"208","the other creature  frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun  swam on shore  and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they came  nor could i  at that distance  know what it was",-1,-1,-3,-3
"209","i found quickly the negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature  so i was willing to have them take it as a favour from me  which  when i made signs to them that they might take him  they were very thankful for",2.75,3,4,2
"210","immediately they fell to work with him  and though they had no knife  yet  with a sharpened piece of wood  they took off his skin as readily  and much more readily  than we could have done with a knife",-0.15,0,-1,0
"211","they offered me some of the flesh  which i declined  pointing out that i would give it them  but made signs for the skin  which they gave me very freely  and brought me a great deal more of their provisions  which  though i did not understand  yet i accepted",1.95,1,4,2
"212","i then made signs to them for some water  and held out one of my jars to them  turning it bottom upward  to show that it was empty  and that i wanted to have it filled",-0.25,0,-1,-1
"213","they called immediately to some of their friends  and there came two women  and brought a great vessel made of earth  and burnt  as i supposed  in the sun  this they set down to me  as before  and i sent xury on shore with my jars  and filled them all three",0.6,1,3,0
"214","the women were as naked as the men",0,0,0,0
"215","i was now furnished with roots and corn  such as it was  and water  and leaving my friendly negroes  i made forward for about eleven days more  without offering to go near the shore  till i saw the land run out a great length into the sea  at about the distance of four or five leagues before me  and the sea being very calm  i kept a large offing to make this point",2.6,3,7,4
"216","at length  doubling the point  at about two leagues from the land  i saw plainly land on the other side  to seaward  then i concluded  as it was most certain indeed  that this was the cape de verde  and those the islands called  from thence  cape de verde islands",0.8,0,1,1
"217","however  they were at a great distance  and i could not well tell what i had best to do  for if i should be taken with a fresh of wind  i might neither reach one or other",2.3,4,8,0
"218","in this dilemma  as i was very pensive  i stepped into the cabin and sat down  xury having the helm  when  on a sudden  the boy cried out  master  master  a ship with a sail  and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits  thinking it must needs be some of his master s ships sent to pursue us  but i knew we were far enough out of their reach",-1.9,0,-3,0
"219","i jumped out of the cabin  and immediately saw  not only the ship  but that it was a portuguese ship  and  as i thought  was bound to the coast of guinea  for negroes",0.35,0,0,0
"220","but  when i observed the course she steered  i was soon convinced they were bound some other way  and did not design to come any nearer to the shore  upon which i stretched out to sea as much as i could  resolving to speak with them if possible",0.95,0,3,0
"221","with all the sail i could make  i found i should not be able to come in their way  but that they would be gone by before i could make any signal to them  but after i had crowded to the utmost  and began to despair  they  it seems  saw by the help of their glasses that it was some european boat  which they supposed must belong to some ship that was lost  so they shortened sail to let me come up",-1.1,-3,-4,-1
"222","i was encouraged with this  and as i had my patron s ancient on board  i made a waft of it to them  for a signal of distress  and fired a gun  both which they saw  for they told me they saw the smoke  though they did not hear the gun",-1.35,-2,-3,-2
"223","upon these signals they very kindly brought to  and lay by for me  and in about three hours  time i came up with them",0.5,1,0,0
"224","they asked me what i was  in portuguese  and in spanish  and in french  but i understood none of them  but at last a scotch sailor  who was on board  called to me  and i answered him  and told him i was an englishman  that i had made my escape out of slavery from the moors  at sallee  they then bade me come on board  and very kindly took me in  and all my goods",0.1,1,-4,-1
"225","it was an inexpressible joy to me  which any one will believe  that i was thus delivered  as i esteemed it  from such a miserable and almost hopeless condition as i was in  and i immediately offered all i had to the captain of the ship  as a return for my deliverance  but he generously told me he would take nothing from me  but that all i had should be delivered safe to me when i came to the brazils",1.7,1,3,2
"226","for  says he  i have saved your life on no other terms than i would be glad to be saved myself  and it may  one time or other  be my lot to be taken up in the same condition",1.55,1,4,1
"227","besides  said he  when i carry you to the brazils  so great a way from your own country  if i should take from you what you have  you will be starved there  and then i only take away that life i have given",0,1,1,-1
"228","no  no  says he  seignior inglese  mr  englishman   i will carry you thither in charity  and those things will help to buy your subsistence there  and your passage home again",0.8,0,1,1
"229","as he was charitable in this proposal  so he was just in the performance to a tittle  for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything that i had  then he took everything into his own possession  and gave me back an exact inventory of them  that i might have them  even to my three earthen jars",0.9,1,2,0
"230","as to my boat  it was a very good one  and that he saw  and told me he would buy it of me for his ship s use  and asked me what i would have for it",0.75,1,3,1
"231","i told him he had been so generous to me in everything that i could not offer to make any price of the boat  but left it entirely to him  upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at brazil  and when it came there  if any one offered to give more  he would make it up",0.75,1,1,3
"232","he offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy xury  which i was loth to take  not that i was unwilling to let the captain have him  but i was very loth to sell the poor boy s liberty  who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own",-0.05,0,-2,1
"233","however  when i let him know my reason  he owned it to be just  and offered me this medium  that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years  if he turned christian  upon this  and xury saying he was willing to go to him  i let the captain have him",2.15,2,1,1
"234","we had a very good voyage to the brazils  and i arrived in the bay de todos los santos  or all saints bay  in about twenty two days after",0.75,1,3,1
"235","and now i was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life  and what to do next with myself i was to consider",-1,-1,-3,-1
"236","the generous treatment the captain gave me i can never enough remember  he would take nothing of me for my passage  gave me twenty ducats for the leopard s skin  and forty for the lion s skin  which i had in my boat  and caused everything i had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me  and what i was willing to sell he bought of me  such as the case of bottles  two of my guns  and a piece of the lump of beeswax for i had made candles of the rest  in a word  i made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo  and with this stock i went on shore in the brazils",1.15,3,2,3
"237","i had not been long here before i was recommended to the house of a good honest man like himself  who had an  ingenio   as they call it  that is  a plantation and a sugar house",2.5,4,9,3
"238","i lived with him some time  and acquainted myself by that means with the manner of planting and making of sugar  and seeing how well the planters lived  and how they got rich suddenly  i resolved  if i could get a licence to settle there  i would turn planter among them  resolving in the meantime to find out some way to get my money  which i had left in london  remitted to me",3.1,2,6,2
"239","to this purpose  getting a kind of letter of naturalisation  i purchased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach  and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement  such a one as might be suitable to the stock which i proposed to myself to receive from england",1.6,1,6,4
"240","i had a neighbour  a portuguese  of lisbon  but born of english parents  whose name was wells  and in much such circumstances as i was",0,0,0,0
"241","i call him my neighbour  because his plantation lay next to mine  and we went on very sociably together",0,0,0,0
"242","my stock was but low  as well as his  and we rather planted for food than anything else  for about two years",1.2,1,0,1
"243","however  we began to increase  and our land began to come into order  so that the third year we planted some tobacco  and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come",1.05,1,1,1
"244","but we both wanted help  and now i found  more than before  i had done wrong in parting with my boy xury",0.1,-1,0,-1
"245","but  alas  for me to do wrong that never did right  was no great wonder",0.15,2,-1,-1
"246","i had no remedy but to go on  i had got into an employment quite remote to my genius  and directly contrary to the life i delighted in  and for which i forsook my father s house  and broke through all his good advice",0.9,3,4,2
"247","nay  i was coming into the very middle station  or upper degree of low life  which my father advised me to before  and which  if i resolved to go on with  i might as well have stayed at home  and never have fatigued myself in the world as i had done  and i used often to say to myself  i could have done this as well in england  among my friends  as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages  in a wilderness  and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least knowledge of me",0.25,-1,0,0
"248","in this manner i used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret",-0.35,-1,-2,-1
"249","i had nobody to converse with  but now and then this neighbour  no work to be done  but by the labour of my hands  and i used to say  i lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island  that had nobody there but himself",0.25,1,1,0
"250","but how just has it been and how should all men reflect  that when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse  heaven may oblige them to make the exchange  and be convinced of their former felicity by their experience i say  how just has it been  that the truly solitary life i reflected on  in an island of mere desolation  should be my lot  who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which i then led  in which  had i continued  i had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich",2.1,3,5,1
"251","i was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation before my kind friend  the captain of the ship that took me up at sea  went back for the ship remained there  in providing his lading and preparing for his voyage  nearly three months when telling him what little stock i had left behind me in london  he gave me this friendly and sincere advice  seignior inglese  says he  for so he always called me   if you will give me letters  and a procuration in form to me  with orders to the person who has your money in london to send your effects to lisbon  to such persons as i shall direct  and in such goods as are proper for this country  i will bring you the produce of them  god willing  at my return  but  since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters  i would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling  which  you say  is half your stock  and let the hazard be run for the first  so that  if it come safe  you may order the rest the same way  and  if it miscarry  you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply",5.35,4,7,13
"252","this was so wholesome advice  and looked so friendly  that i could not but be convinced it was the best course i could take  so i accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom i had left my money  and a procuration to the portuguese captain  as he desired",4.5,3,9,5
"253","i wrote the english captain s widow a full account of all my adventures my slavery  escape  and how i had met with the portuguese captain at sea  the humanity of his behaviour  and what condition i was now in  with all other necessary directions for my supply  and when this honest captain came to lisbon  he found means  by some of the english merchants there  to send over  not the order only  but a full account of my story to a merchant in london  who represented it effectually to her  whereupon she not only delivered the money  but out of her own pocket sent the portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me",3.75,2,3,10
"254","the merchant in london  vesting this hundred pounds in english goods  such as the captain had written for  sent them directly to him at lisbon  and he brought them all safe to me to the brazils  among which  without my direction  for i was too young in my business to think of them   he had taken care to have all sorts of tools  ironwork  and utensils necessary for my plantation  and which were of great use to me",3.25,2,6,4
"255","when this cargo arrived i thought my fortune made  for i was surprised with the joy of it  and my stood steward  the captain  had laid out the five pounds  which my friend had sent him for a present for himself  to purchase and bring me over a servant  under bond for six years service  and would not accept of any consideration  except a little tobacco  which i would have him accept  being of my own produce",3.3,2,7,4
"256","neither was this all  for my goods being all english manufacture  such as cloths  stuffs  baize  and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country  i found means to sell them to a very great advantage  so that i might say i had more than four times the value of my first cargo  and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour i mean in the advancement of my plantation  for the first thing i did  i bought me a negro slave  and an european servant also i mean another besides that which the captain brought me from lisbon",4.05,2,2,4
"257","but as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our greatest adversity  so it was with me  i went on the next year with great success in my plantation  i raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground  more than i had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours  and these fifty rolls  being each of above a hundredweight  were well cured  and laid by against the return of the fleet from lisbon  and now increasing in business and wealth  my head began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach  such as are  indeed  often the ruin of the best heads in business",0.95,3,13,3
"258","had i continued in the station i was now in  i had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet  retired life  and of which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of  but other things attended me  and i was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries  and particularly  to increase my fault  and double the reflections upon myself  which in my future sorrows i should have leisure to make  all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad  and pursuing that inclination  in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects  and those measures of life  which nature and providence concurred to present me with  and to make my duty",3.55,3,8,6
"259","as i had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents  so i could not be content now  but i must go and leave the happy view i had of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation  only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted  and thus i cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into  or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the world",1.85,0,0,0
"260","to come  then  by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of my story",0,0,0,0
"261","you may suppose  that having now lived almost four years in the brazils  and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation  i had not only learned the language  but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow planters  as well as among the merchants at st  salvador  which was our port  and that  in my discourses among them  i had frequently given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of guinea  the manner of trading with the negroes there  and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles such as beads  toys  knives  scissors  hatchets  bits of glass  and the like not only gold dust  guinea grains  elephants teeth   c",4.85,5,7,3
"262","but negroes  for the service of the brazils  in great numbers",0.5,1,3,1
"263","they listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads  but especially to that part which related to the buying of negroes  which was a trade at that time  not only not far entered into  but  as far as it was  had been carried on by assientos  or permission of the kings of spain and portugal  and engrossed in the public stock  so that few negroes were bought  and these excessively dear",1.1,-1,3,3
"264","it happened  being in company with some merchants and planters of my acquaintance  and talking of those things very earnestly  three of them came to me next morning  and told me they had been musing very much upon what i had discoursed with them of the last night  and they came to make a secret proposal to me  and  after enjoining me to secrecy  they told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to guinea  that they had all plantations as well as i  and were straitened for nothing so much as servants  that as it was a trade that could not be carried on  because they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home  so they desired to make but one voyage  to bring the negroes on shore privately  and divide them among their own plantations  and  in a word  the question was whether i would go their supercargo in the ship  to manage the trading part upon the coast of guinea  and they offered me that i should have my equal share of the negroes  without providing any part of the stock",4.8,2,4,7
"265","this was a fair proposal  it must be confessed  had it been made to any one that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look after  which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable  and with a good stock upon it  but for me  that was thus entered and established  and had nothing to do but to go on as i had begun  for three or four years more  and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from england  and who in that time  and with that little addition  could scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling  and that increasing too for me to think of such a voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty of",0.4,-1,3,3
"266","but i  that was born to be my own destroyer  could no more resist the offer than i could restrain my first rambling designs when my father s good counsel was lost upon me",-1.45,-1,-1,-2
"267","in a word  i told them i would go with all my heart  if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence  and would dispose of it to such as i should direct  if i miscarried",-0.5,-1,0,0
"268","this they all engaged to do  and entered into writings or covenants to do so  and i made a formal will  disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my death  making the captain of the ship that had saved my life  as before  my universal heir  but obliging him to dispose of my effects as i had directed in my will  one half of the produce being to himself  and the other to be shipped to england",0.2,-1,0,1
"269","in short  i took all possible caution to preserve my effects and to keep up my plantation",0.35,0,0,0
"270","had i used half as much prudence to have looked into my own interest  and have made a judgment of what i ought to have done and not to have done  i had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking  leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance  and gone upon a voyage to sea  attended with all its common hazards  to say nothing of the reasons i had to expect particular misfortunes to myself",0.85,3,6,6
"271","but i was hurried on  and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather than my reason  and  accordingly  the ship being fitted out  and the cargo furnished  and all things done  as by agreement  by my partners in the voyage  i went on board in an evil hour  the st september   being the same day eight years that i went from my father and mother at hull  in order to act the rebel to their authority  and the fool to my own interests",0,0,-4,-1
"272","our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden  carried six guns and fourteen men  besides the master  his boy  and myself",-0.5,0,-2,0
"273","we had on board no large cargo of goods  except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the negroes  such as beads  bits of glass  shells  and other trifles  especially little looking glasses  knives  scissors  hatchets  and the like",1.5,1,2,1
"274","the same day i went on board we set sail  standing away to the northward upon our own coast  with design to stretch over for the african coast when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude  which  it seems  was the manner of course in those days",0.6,0,0,2
"275","we had very good weather  only excessively hot  all the way upon our own coast  till we came to the height of cape st  augustino  from whence  keeping further off at sea  we lost sight of land  and steered as if we were bound for the isle fernando de noronha  holding our course n e  by n   and leaving those isles on the east",-0.7,0,0,2
"276","in this course we passed the line in about twelve days time  and were  by our last observation  in seven degrees twenty two minutes northern latitude  when a violent tornado  or hurricane  took us quite out of our knowledge",-0.95,-1,-3,-1
"277","it began from the south east  came about to the north west  and then settled in the north east  from whence it blew in such a terrible manner  that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive  and  scudding away before it  let it carry us whither fate and the fury of the winds directed  and  during these twelve days  i need not say that i expected every day to be swallowed up  nor  indeed  did any in the ship expect to save their lives",-0.6,-2,-1,-1
"278","in this distress we had  besides the terror of the storm  one of our men die of the calenture  and one man and the boy washed overboard",-2.75,-3,-8,-5
"279","about the twelfth day  the weather abating a little  the master made an observation as well as he could  and found that he was in about eleven degrees north latitude  but that he was twenty two degrees of longitude difference west from cape st  augustino  so that he found he was upon the coast of guiana  or the north part of brazil  beyond the river amazon  toward that of the river orinoco  commonly called the great river  and began to consult with me what course he should take  for the ship was leaky  and very much disabled  and he was going directly back to the coast of brazil",1,1,3,1
"280","i was positively against that  and looking over the charts of the sea coast of america with him  we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the caribbee islands  and therefore resolved to stand away for barbadoes  which  by keeping off at sea  to avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of mexico  we might easily perform  as we hoped  in about fifteen days sail  whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves",2.25,1,2,2
"281","with this design we changed our course  and steered away n w  by w   in order to reach some of our english islands  where i hoped for relief",0.5,1,1,1
"282","but our voyage was otherwise determined  for  being in the latitude of twelve degrees eighteen minutes  a second storm came upon us  which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward  and drove us so out of the way of all human commerce  that  had all our lives been saved as to the sea  we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own country",-1.1,-2,2,0
"283","in this distress  the wind still blowing very hard  one of our men early in the morning cried out  land  and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out  in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were  than the ship struck upon a sand  and in a moment her motion being so stopped  the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we should all have perished immediately  and we were immediately driven into our close quarters  to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea",-3.9,-4,-7,0
"284","it is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances",0.55,1,3,-1
"285","we knew nothing where we were  or upon what land it was we were driven whether an island or the main  whether inhabited or not inhabited",0.4,0,0,2
"286","as the rage of the wind was still great  though rather less than at first  we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking into pieces  unless the winds  by a kind of miracle  should turn immediately about",0.65,0,9,2
"287","in a word  we sat looking upon one another  and expecting death every moment  and every man  accordingly  preparing for another world  for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"288","that which was our present comfort  and all the comfort we had  was that  contrary to our expectation  the ship did not break yet  and that the master said the wind began to abate",0.4,1,2,3
"289","now  though we thought that the wind did a little abate  yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand  and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off  we were in a dreadful condition indeed  and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could",0.75,0,-4,0
"290","we had a boat at our stern just before the storm  but she was first staved by dashing against the ship s rudder  and in the next place she broke away  and either sunk or was driven off to sea  so there was no hope from her",-1,-2,0,-1
"291","we had another boat on board  but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful thing",-0.75,-1,-1,0
"292","however  there was no time to debate  for we fancied that the ship would break in pieces every minute  and some told us she was actually broken already",-1,-2,-2,0
"293","in this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat  and with the help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship s side  and getting all into her  let go  and committed ourselves  being eleven in number  to god s mercy and the wild sea  for though the storm was abated considerably  yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore  and might be well called  den wild zee   as the dutch call the sea in a storm",0.9,-1,4,2
"294","and now our case was very dismal indeed  for we all saw plainly that the sea went so high that the boat could not live  and that we should be inevitably drowned",-2.05,-2,-4,-1
"295","as to making sail  we had none  nor if we had could we have done anything with it  so we worked at the oar towards the land  though with heavy hearts  like men going to execution  for we all knew that when the boat came near the shore she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea",-0.75,1,0,-1
"296","however  we committed our souls to god in the most earnest manner  and the wind driving us towards the shore  we hastened our destruction with our own hands  pulling as well as we could towards land",1.3,1,1,3
"297","what the shore was  whether rock or sand  whether steep or shoal  we knew not",-0.25,-1,0,1
"298","the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was  if we might find some bay or gulf  or the mouth of some river  where by great chance we might have run our boat in  or got under the lee of the land  and perhaps made smooth water",2.1,2,7,3
"299","but there was nothing like this appeared  but as we made nearer and nearer the shore  the land looked more frightful than the sea",0,0,2,1
"300","after we had rowed  or rather driven about a league and a half  as we reckoned it  a raging wave  mountain like  came rolling astern of us  and plainly bade us expect the  coup de gr ce",0.65,0,2,1
"301","it took us with such a fury  that it overset the boat at once  and separating us as well from the boat as from one another  gave us no time to say  o god  for we were all swallowed up in a moment",0.3,0,0,0
"302","nothing can describe the confusion of thought which i felt when i sank into the water  for though i swam very well  yet i could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath  till that wave having driven me  or rather carried me  a vast way on towards the shore  and having spent itself  went back  and left me upon the land almost dry  but half dead with the water i took in",-0.95,-1,-3,-1
"303","i had so much presence of mind  as well as breath left  that seeing myself nearer the mainland than i expected  i got upon my feet  and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as i could before another wave should return and take me up again  but i soon found it was impossible to avoid it  for i saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill  and as furious as an enemy  which i had no means or strength to contend with  my business was to hold my breath  and raise myself upon the water if i could  and so  by swimming  to preserve my breathing  and pilot myself towards the shore  if possible  my greatest concern now being that the sea  as it would carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on  might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea",-0.45,-1,0,3
"304","the wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body  and i could feel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way  but i held my breath  and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might",1.45,3,3,1
"305","i was ready to burst with holding my breath  when  as i felt myself rising up  so  to my immediate relief  i found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water  and though it was not two seconds of time that i could keep myself so  yet it relieved me greatly  gave me breath  and new courage",3.95,3,3,3
"306","i was covered again with water a good while  but not so long but i held it out  and finding the water had spent itself  and began to return  i struck forward against the return of the waves  and felt ground again with my feet",0.6,0,2,1
"307","i stood still a few moments to recover breath  and till the waters went from me  and then took to my heels and ran with what strength i had further towards the shore",1.5,1,2,1
"308","but neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea  which came pouring in after me again  and twice more i was lifted up by the waves and carried forward as before  the shore being very flat",0.1,-1,0,1
"309","the last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me  for the sea having hurried me along as before  landed me  or rather dashed me  against a piece of rock  and that with such force  that it left me senseless  and indeed helpless  as to my own deliverance  for the blow taking my side and breast  beat the breath as it were quite out of my body  and had it returned again immediately  i must have been strangled in the water  but i recovered a little before the return of the waves  and seeing i should be covered again with the water  i resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock  and so to hold my breath  if possible  till the wave went back",-1.45,-2,-5,-2
"310","now  as the waves were not so high as at first  being nearer land  i held my hold till the wave abated  and then fetched another run  which brought me so near the shore that the next wave  though it went over me  yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away  and the next run i took  i got to the mainland  where  to my great comfort  i clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat me down upon the grass  free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water",1,2,5,1
"311","i was now landed and safe on shore  and began to look up and thank god that my life was saved  in a case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope",2.05,1,8,2
"312","i believe it is impossible to express  to the life  what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are  when it is so saved  as i may say  out of the very grave  and i do not wonder now at the custom  when a malefactor  who has the halter about his neck  is tied up  and just going to be turned off  and has a reprieve brought to him i say  i do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it  to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it  that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him",0.7,0,0,-2
"313","for sudden joys  like griefs  confound at first",-1,0,2,-1
"314","i walked about on the shore lifting up my hands  and my whole being  as i may say  wrapped up in a contemplation of my deliverance  making a thousand gestures and motions  which i cannot describe  reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned  and that there should not be one soul saved but myself  for  as for them  i never saw them afterwards  or any sign of them  except three of their hats  one cap  and two shoes that were not fellows",0.65,0,0,2
"315","i cast my eye to the stranded vessel  when  the breach and froth of the sea being so big  i could hardly see it  it lay so far of  and considered  lord  how was it possible i could get on shore",-1.5,-1,-1,-2
"316","after i had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition  i began to look round me  to see what kind of place i was in  and what was next to be done  and i soon found my comforts abate  and that  in a word  i had a dreadful deliverance  for i was wet  had no clothes to shift me  nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me  neither did i see any prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by wild beasts  and that which was particularly afflicting to me was  that i had no weapon  either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance  or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs",1.8,-1,1,3
"317","in a word  i had nothing about me but a knife  a tobacco pipe  and a little tobacco in a box",-0.65,-1,0,0
"318","this was all my provisions  and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind  that for a while i ran about like a madman",-2,-2,-1,-2
"319","night coming upon me  i began with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country  as at night they always come abroad for their prey",-1.3,0,0,-2
"320","all the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir  but thorny  which grew near me  and where i resolved to sit all night  and consider the next day what death i should die  for as yet i saw no prospect of life",-0.3,-1,-3,0
"321","i walked about a furlong from the shore  to see if i could find any fresh water to drink  which i did  to my great joy  and having drank  and put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger  i went to the tree  and getting up into it  endeavoured to place myself so that if i should sleep i might not fall",0.4,2,4,0
"322","and having cut me a short stick  like a truncheon  for my defence  i took up my lodging  and having been excessively fatigued  i fell fast asleep  and slept as comfortably as  i believe  few could have done in my condition  and found myself more refreshed with it than  i think  i ever was on such an occasion",0.8,1,1,-1
"323","when i waked it was broad day  the weather clear  and the storm abated  so that the sea did not rage and swell as before",-0.75,0,-1,-1
"324","but that which surprised me most was  that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide  and was driven up almost as far as the rock which i at first mentioned  where i had been so bruised by the wave dashing me against it",-0.5,-1,0,1
"325","this being within about a mile from the shore where i was  and the ship seeming to stand upright still  i wished myself on board  that at least i might save some necessary things for my use",1.1,0,2,2
"326","when i came down from my apartment in the tree  i looked about me again  and the first thing i found was the boat  which lay  as the wind and the sea had tossed her up  upon the land  about two miles on my right hand",1.4,1,0,4
"327","i walked as far as i could upon the shore to have got to her  but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad  so i came back for the present  being more intent upon getting at the ship  where i hoped to find something for my present subsistence",0.85,0,0,2
"328","a little after noon i found the sea very calm  and the tide ebbed so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship",1.35,1,2,3
"329","and here i found a fresh renewing of my grief  for i saw evidently that if we had kept on board we had been all safe that is to say  we had all got safe on shore  and i had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company as i now was",-0.15,0,-1,0
"330","this forced tears to my eyes again  but as there was little relief in that  i resolved  if possible  to get to the ship  so i pulled off my clothes for the weather was hot to extremity and took the water",-0.7,2,-1,-1
"331","but when i came to the ship my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board  for  as she lay aground  and high out of the water  there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of",-0.5,-2,4,-1
"332","i swam round her twice  and the second time i spied a small piece of rope  which i wondered i did not see at first  hung down by the fore chains so low  as that with great difficulty i got hold of it  and by the help of that rope i got up into the forecastle of the ship",0,-1,5,-1
"333","here i found that the ship was bulged  and had a great deal of water in her hold  but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand  or  rather earth  that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank  and her head low  almost to the water",0.1,-1,2,1
"334","by this means all her quarter was free  and all that was in that part was dry  for you may be sure my first work was to search  and to see what was spoiled and what was free",0.15,1,-1,0
"335","and  first  i found that all the ship s provisions were dry and untouched by the water  and being very well disposed to eat  i went to the bread room and filled my pockets with biscuit  and ate it as i went about other things  for i had no time to lose",0.65,-1,-1,2
"336","i also found some rum in the great cabin  of which i took a large dram  and which i had  indeed  need enough of to spirit me for what was before me",1.35,2,4,2
"337","now i wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many things which i foresaw would be very necessary to me",0,0,0,0
"338","it was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had  and this extremity roused my application",-0.45,-1,1,-1
"339","we had several spare yards  and two or three large spars of wood  and a spare topmast or two in the ship  i resolved to fall to work with these  and i flung as many of them overboard as i could manage for their weight  tying every one with a rope  that they might not drive away",1,0,2,0
"340","when this was done i went down the ship s side  and pulling them to me  i tied four of them together at both ends as well as i could  in the form of a raft  and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them crossways  i found i could walk upon it very well  but that it was not able to bear any great weight  the pieces being too light",1.9,2,3,1
"341","so i went to work  and with a carpenter s saw i cut a spare topmast into three lengths  and added them to my raft  with a great deal of labour and pains",0,1,2,0
"342","but the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what i should have been able to have done upon another occasion",1.3,0,4,1
"343","my raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight",0.75,3,2,0
"344","my next care was what to load it with  and how to preserve what i laid upon it from the surf of the sea  but i was not long considering this",1.6,0,2,2
"345","i first laid all the planks or boards upon it that i could get  and having considered well what i most wanted  i got three of the seamen s chests  which i had broken open  and emptied  and lowered them down upon my raft  the first of these i filled with provisions viz  bread  rice  three dutch cheeses  five pieces of dried goat s flesh  which we lived much upon   and a little remainder of european corn  which had been laid by for some fowls which we brought to sea with us  but the fowls were killed",-0.45,-1,-4,0
"346","there had been some barley and wheat together  but  to my great disappointment  i found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all",-0.5,-1,-1,0
"347","as for liquors  i found several  cases of bottles belonging to our skipper  in which were some cordial waters  and  in all  about five or six gallons of rack",0.6,0,0,0
"348","these i stowed by themselves  there being no need to put them into the chest  nor any room for them",0,0,-1,0
"349","while i was doing this  i found the tide begin to flow  though very calm  and i had the mortification to see my coat  shirt  and waistcoat  which i had left on the shore  upon the sand  swim away",0.6,0,2,3
"350","as for my breeches  which were only linen  and open kneed  i swam on board in them and my stockings",0,0,0,0
"351","however  this set me on rummaging for clothes  of which i found enough  but took no more than i wanted for present use  for i had others things which my eye was more upon as  first  tools to work with on shore",0.85,2,-1,2
"352","and it was after long searching that i found out the carpenter s chest  which was  indeed  a very useful prize to me  and much more valuable than a shipload of gold would have been at that time",2.9,4,4,3
"353","i got it down to my raft  whole as it was  without losing time to look into it  for i knew in general what it contained",-0.35,-1,-3,0
"354","my next care was for some ammunition and arms",1,0,2,0
"355","there were two very good fowling pieces in the great cabin  and two pistols",1.25,2,6,1
"356","these i secured first  with some powder horns and a small bag of shot  and two old rusty swords",0.15,-1,2,-3
"357","i knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship  but knew not where our gunner had stowed them  but with much search i found them  two of them dry and good  the third had taken water",1.35,1,3,2
"358","those two i got to my raft with the arms",0,0,0,0
"359","and now i thought myself pretty well freighted  and began to think how i should get to shore with them  having neither sail  oar  nor rudder  and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation",1.55,2,1,1
"360","i had three encouragements st  a smooth  calm sea  ndly  the tide rising  and setting in to the shore  rdly  what little wind there was blew me towards the land",1.35,2,2,4
"361","and thus  having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat and  besides the tools which were in the chest  i found two saws  an axe  and a hammer  with this cargo i put to sea",-0.55,-1,-2,1
"362","for a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well  only that i found it drive a little distant from the place where i had landed before  by which i perceived that there was some indraft of the water  and consequently i hoped to find some creek or river there  which i might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo",1.4,1,0,3
"363","as i imagined  so it was",0,0,0,0
"364","there appeared before me a little opening of the land  and i found a strong current of the tide set into it  so i guided my raft as well as i could  to keep in the middle of the stream",1.9,2,2,2
"365","but here i had like to have suffered a second shipwreck  which  if i had  i think verily would have broken my heart  for  knowing nothing of the coast  my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal  and not being aground at the other end  it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that was afloat  and to fallen into the water",-0.75,-4,-3,0
"366","i did my utmost  by setting my back against the chests  to keep them in their places  but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength  neither durst i stir from the posture i was in  but holding up the chests with all my might  i stood in that manner near half an hour  in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level  and a little after  the water still rising  my raft floated again  and i thrust her off with the oar i had into the channel  and then driving up higher  i at length found myself in the mouth of a little river  with land on both sides  and a strong current of tide running up",2.4,1,4,5
"367","i looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore  for i was not willing to be driven too high up the river  hoping in time to see some ships at sea  and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as i could",3.1,2,4,3
"368","at length i spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek  to which with great pain and difficulty i guided my raft  and at last got so near that  reaching ground with my oar  i could thrust her directly in",0.05,0,2,-1
"369","but here i had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again  for that shore lying pretty steep that is to say sloping there was no place to land  but where one end of my float  if it ran on shore  would lie so high  and the other sink lower  as before  that it would endanger my cargo again",-0.75,-3,2,-1
"370","all that i could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest  keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor  to hold the side of it fast to the shore  near a flat piece of ground  which i expected the water would flow over  and so it did",0.25,2,2,1
"371","as soon as i found water enough for my raft drew about a foot of water i thrust her upon that flat piece of ground  and there fastened or moored her  by sticking my two broken oars into the ground  one on one side near one end  and one on the other side near the other end  and thus i lay till the water ebbed away  and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore",0.35,1,0,1
"372","my next work was to view the country  and seek a proper place for my habitation  and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might happen",1.85,3,2,2
"373","where i was  i yet knew not  whether on the continent or on an island  whether inhabited or not inhabited  whether in danger of wild beasts or not",-1,-2,-2,-2
"374","there was a hill not above a mile from me  which rose up very steep and high  and which seemed to overtop some other hills  which lay as in a ridge from it northward",-0.25,-1,1,0
"375","i took out one of the fowling pieces  and one of the pistols  and a horn of powder  and thus armed  i travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill  where  after i had with great labour and difficulty got to the top  i saw my fate  to my great affliction viz  that i was in an island environed every way with the sea  no land to be seen except some rocks  which lay a great way off  and two small islands  less than this  which lay about three leagues to the west",-0.4,0,4,0
"376","i found also that the island i was in was barren  and  as i saw good reason to believe  uninhabited except by wild beasts  of whom  however  i saw none",1.2,-1,3,1
"377","yet i saw abundance of fowls  but knew not their kinds  neither when i killed them could i tell what was fit for food  and what not",0.9,0,-2,1
"378","at my coming back  i shot at a great bird which i saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood",0.1,1,3,0
"379","i believe it was the first gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world",-1,0,-3,-1
"380","i had no sooner fired  than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls  of many sorts  making a confused screaming and crying  and every one according to his usual note  but not one of them of any kind that i knew",-1.1,-1,-7,0
"381","as for the creature i killed  i took it to be a kind of hawk  its colour and beak resembling it  but it had no talons or claws more than common",-0.25,-1,-2,-1
"382","its flesh was carrion  and fit for nothing",0.4,0,1,0
"383","contented with this discovery  i came back to my raft  and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore  which took me up the rest of that day",0.6,0,0,1
"384","what to do with myself at night i knew not  nor indeed where to rest  for i was afraid to lie down on the ground  not knowing but some wild beast might devour me  though  as i afterwards found  there was really no need for those fears",-2.2,-4,-3,-2
"385","however  as well as i could  i barricaded myself round with the chest and boards that i had brought on shore  and made a kind of hut for that night s lodging",1.3,1,2,2
"386","as for food  i yet saw not which way to supply myself  except that i had seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the wood where i shot the fowl",0.5,1,2,1
"387","i now began to consider that i might yet get a great many things out of the ship which would be useful to me  and particularly some of the rigging and sails  and such other things as might come to land  and i resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel  if possible",1.6,2,7,1
"388","and as i knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces  i resolved to set all other things apart till i had got everything out of the ship that i could get",0.1,-1,2,-1
"389","then i called a council that is to say in my thoughts whether i should take back the raft  but this appeared impracticable  so i resolved to go as before  when the tide was down  and i did so  only that i stripped before i went from my hut  having nothing on but my chequered shirt  a pair of linen drawers  and a pair of pumps on my feet",0.2,0,2,0
"390","i got on board the ship as before  and prepared a second raft  and  having had experience of the first  i neither made this so unwieldy  nor loaded it so hard  but yet i brought away several things very useful to me  as first  in the carpenters stores i found two or three bags full of nails and spikes  a great screw jack  a dozen or two of hatchets  and  above all  that most useful thing called a grindstone",0.85,0,5,3
"391","all these i secured  together with several things belonging to the gunner  particularly two or three iron crows  and two barrels of musket bullets  seven muskets  another fowling piece  with some small quantity of powder more  a large bagful of small shot  and a great roll of sheet lead  but this last was so heavy  i could not hoist it up to get it over the ship s side",1.15,2,5,0
"392","besides these things  i took all the men s clothes that i could find  and a spare fore topsail  a hammock  and some bedding  and with this i loaded my second raft  and brought them all safe on shore  to my very great comfort",2,3,6,3
"393","i was under some apprehension  during my absence from the land  that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore  but when i came back i found no sign of any visitor  only there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests  which  when i came towards it  ran away a little distance  and then stood still",-0.8,-2,1,-1
"394","she sat very composed and unconcerned  and looked full in my face  as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me  i presented my gun at her  but  as she did not understand it  she was perfectly unconcerned at it  nor did she offer to stir away  upon which i tossed her a bit of biscuit  though by the way  i was not very free of it  for my store was not great  however  i spared her a bit  i say  and she went to it  smelled at it  and ate it  and looked  as if pleased  for more  but i thanked her  and could spare no more  so she marched off",1.9,3,6,4
"395","having got my second cargo on shore though i was fain to open the barrels of powder  and bring them by parcels  for they were too heavy  being large casks i went to work to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles which i cut for that purpose  and into this tent i brought everything that i knew would spoil either with rain or sun  and i piled all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent  to fortify it from any sudden attempt  either from man or beast",-0.05,0,-2,1
"396","when i had done this  i blocked up the door of the tent with some boards within  and an empty chest set up on end without  and spreading one of the beds upon the ground  laying my two pistols just at my head  and my gun at length by me  i went to bed for the first time  and slept very quietly all night  for i was very weary and heavy  for the night before i had slept little  and had laboured very hard all day to fetch all those things from the ship  and to get them on shore",-2.15,-2,-6,-2
"397","i had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up  i believe  for one man  but i was not satisfied still  for while the ship sat upright in that posture  i thought i ought to get everything out of her that i could  so every day at low water i went on board  and brought away something or other  but particularly the third time i went i brought away as much of the rigging as i could  as also all the small ropes and rope twine i could get  with a piece of spare canvas  which was to mend the sails upon occasion  and the barrel of wet gunpowder",1.2,1,2,1
"398","in a word  i brought away all the sails  first and last  only that i was fain to cut them in pieces  and bring as much at a time as i could  for they were no more useful to be sails  but as mere canvas only",0.25,1,0,2
"399","but that which comforted me more still  was  that last of all  after i had made five or six such voyages as these  and thought i had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with i say  after all this  i found a great hogshead of bread  three large runlets of rum  or spirits  a box of sugar  and a barrel of fine flour  this was surprising to me  because i had given over expecting any more provisions  except what was spoiled by the water",2.15,2,5,5
"400","i soon emptied the hogshead of the bread  and wrapped it up  parcel by parcel  in pieces of the sails  which i cut out  and  in a word  i got all this safe on shore also",0.5,1,0,2
"401","the next day i made another voyage  and now  having plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out  i began with the cables",0.65,1,1,1
"402","cutting the great cable into pieces  such as i could move  i got two cables and a hawser on shore  with all the ironwork i could get  and having cut down the spritsail yard  and the mizzen yard  and everything i could  to make a large raft  i loaded it with all these heavy goods  and came away",0.85,1,1,0
"403","but my good luck began now to leave me  for this raft was so unwieldy  and so overladen  that  after i had entered the little cove where i had landed the rest of my goods  not being able to guide it so handily as i did the other  it overset  and threw me and all my cargo into the water",2.45,2,5,6
"404","as for myself  it was no great harm  for i was near the shore  but as to my cargo  it was a great part of it lost  especially the iron  which i expected would have been of great use to me  however  when the tide was out  i got most of the pieces of the cable ashore  and some of the iron  though with infinite labour  for i was fain to dip for it into the water  a work which fatigued me very much",-0.9,-1,-5,0
"405","after this  i went every day on board  and brought away what i could get",0,0,0,0
"406","i had been now thirteen days on shore  and had been eleven times on board the ship  in which time i had brought away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring  though i believe verily  had the calm weather held  i should have brought away the whole ship  piece by piece",2.85,3,3,2
"407","but preparing the twelfth time to go on board  i found the wind began to rise  however  at low water i went on board  and though i thought i had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could be found  yet i discovered a locker with drawers in it  in one of which i found two or three razors  and one pair of large scissors  with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks  in another i found about thirty six pounds value in money some european coin  some brazil  some pieces of eight  some gold  and some silver",2.2,2,6,4
"408","i smiled to myself at the sight of this money  o drug  said i  aloud  what art thou good for",2.65,1,5,3
"409","thou art not worth to me no  not the taking off the ground  one of those knives is worth all this heap  i have no manner of use for thee e en remain where thou art  and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is not worth saving",1.9,1,1,0
"410","however  upon second thoughts i took it away  and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas  i began to think of making another raft  but while i was preparing this  i found the sky overcast  and the wind began to rise  and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore",0.5,1,2,1
"411","it presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind offshore  and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began  otherwise i might not be able to reach the shore at all",-1.75,-2,0,-1
"412","accordingly  i let myself down into the water  and swam across the channel  which lay between the ship and the sands  and even that with difficulty enough  partly with the weight of the things i had about me  and partly the roughness of the water  for the wind rose very hastily  and before it was quite high water it blew a storm",-1.4,-1,1,-3
"413","but i had got home to my little tent  where i lay  with all my wealth about me  very secure",1,1,5,1
"414","it blew very hard all night  and in the morning  when i looked out  behold  no more ship was to be seen",-0.25,-1,-2,0
"415","i was a little surprised  but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection that i had lost no time  nor abated any diligence  to get everything out of her that could be useful to me  and that  indeed  there was little left in her that i was able to bring away  if i had had more time",1.05,2,-2,0
"416","i now gave over any more thoughts of the ship  or of anything out of her  except what might drive on shore from her wreck  as  indeed  divers pieces of her afterwards did  but those things were of small use to me",-0.75,-1,-2,-2
"417","my thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either savages  if any should appear  or wild beasts  if any were in the island  and i had many thoughts of the method how to do this  and what kind of dwelling to make whether i should make me a cave in the earth  or a tent upon the earth  and  in short  i resolved upon both  the manner and description of which  it may not be improper to give an account of",-0.95,-4,2,0
"418","i soon found the place i was in was not fit for my settlement  because it was upon a low  moorish ground  near the sea  and i believed it would not be wholesome  and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it  so i resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground",4.15,4,6,5
"419","i consulted several things in my situation  which i found would be proper for me  st  health and fresh water  i just now mentioned  ndly  shelter from the heat of the sun  rdly  security from ravenous creatures  whether man or beast  thly  a view to the sea  that if god sent any ship in sight  i might not lose any advantage for my deliverance  of which i was not willing to banish all my expectation yet",2.5,2,3,5
"420","in search of a place proper for this  i found a little plain on the side of a rising hill  whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house side  so that nothing could come down upon me from the top",0.85,1,2,4
"421","on the one side of the rock there was a hollow place  worn a little way in  like the entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all",-0.1,-2,0,-1
"422","on the flat of the green  just before this hollow place  i resolved to pitch my tent",0.1,-1,1,0
"423","this plain was not above a hundred yards broad  and about twice as long  and lay like a green before my door  and  at the end of it  descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by the seaside",0.5,1,2,1
"424","it was on the n n w  side of the hill  so that it was sheltered from the heat every day  till it came to a w  and by s  sun  or thereabouts  which  in those countries  is near the setting",0.6,0,0,1
"425","before i set up my tent i drew a half circle before the hollow place  which took in about ten yards in its semi diameter from the rock  and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending",-0.5,-1,-1,0
"426","in this half circle i pitched two rows of strong stakes  driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles  the biggest end being out of the ground above five feet and a half  and sharpened on the top",1,3,6,0
"427","the two rows did not stand above six inches from one another",0,0,0,0
"428","then i took the pieces of cable which i had cut in the ship  and laid them in rows  one upon another  within the circle  between these two rows of stakes  up to the top  placing other stakes in the inside  leaning against them  about two feet and a half high  like a spur to a post  and this fence was so strong  that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it",0.25,3,5,0
"429","this cost me a great deal of time and labour  especially to cut the piles in the woods  bring them to the place  and drive them into the earth",0.5,1,2,0
"430","the entrance into this place i made to be  not by a door  but by a short ladder to go over the top  which ladder  when i was in  i lifted over after me  and so i was completely fenced in and fortified  as i thought  from all the world  and consequently slept secure in the night  which otherwise i could not have done  though  as it appeared afterwards  there was no need of all this caution from the enemies that i apprehended danger from",-0.6,0,-1,0
"431","into this fence or fortress  with infinite labour  i carried all my riches  all my provisions  ammunition  and stores  of which you have the account above  and i made a large tent  which to preserve me from the rains that in one part of the year are very violent there  i made double one smaller tent within  and one larger tent above it  and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin  which i had saved among the sails",1,-1,-1,2
"432","and now i lay no more for a while in the bed which i had brought on shore  but in a hammock  which was indeed a very good one  and belonged to the mate of the ship",1.35,1,2,2
"433","into this tent i brought all my provisions  and everything that would spoil by the wet  and having thus enclosed all my goods  i made up the entrance  which till now i had left open  and so passed and repassed  as i said  by a short ladder",0.1,-1,0,0
"434","when i had done this  i began to work my way into the rock  and bringing all the earth and stones that i dug down out through my tent  i laid them up within my fence  in the nature of a terrace  so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half  and thus i made me a cave  just behind my tent  which served me like a cellar to my house",0.75,1,2,1
"435","it cost me much labour and many days before all these things were brought to perfection  and therefore i must go back to some other things which took up some of my thoughts",0.5,1,3,1
"436","at the same time it happened  after i had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent  and making the cave  that a storm of rain falling from a thick  dark cloud  a sudden flash of lightning happened  and after that a great clap of thunder  as is naturally the effect of it",-1.2,-3,2,-2
"437","i was not so much surprised with the lightning as i was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning itself oh  my powder",0.75,1,2,1
"438","my very heart sank within me when i thought that  at one blast  all my powder might be destroyed  on which  not my defence only  but the providing my food  as i thought  entirely depended",-0.2,0,-3,0
"439","i was nothing near so anxious about my own danger  though  had the powder took fire  i should never have known who had hurt me",-2.5,-3,-8,-3
"440","such impression did this make upon me  that after the storm was over i laid aside all my works  my building and fortifying  and applied myself to make bags and boxes  to separate the powder  and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel  in the hope that  whatever might come  it might not all take fire at once  and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another",0.45,1,0,2
"441","i finished this work in about a fortnight  and i think my powder  which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight  was divided in not less than a hundred parcels",0.25,1,0,0
"442","as to the barrel that had been wet  i did not apprehend any danger from that  so i placed it in my new cave  which  in my fancy  i called my kitchen  and the rest i hid up and down in holes among the rocks  so that no wet might come to it  marking very carefully where i laid it",0.8,-1,-2,2
"443","in the interval of time while this was doing  i went out once at least every day with my gun  as well to divert myself as to see if i could kill anything fit for food  and  as near as i could  to acquaint myself with what the island produced",0.35,0,-3,-1
"444","the first time i went out  i presently discovered that there were goats in the island  which was a great satisfaction to me  but then it was attended with this misfortune to me viz  that they were so shy  so subtle  and so swift of foot  that it was the most difficult thing in the world to come at them  but i was not discouraged at this  not doubting but i might now and then shoot one  as it soon happened  for after i had found their haunts a little  i laid wait in this manner for them  i observed if they saw me in the valleys  though they were upon the rocks  they would run away  as in a terrible fright  but if they were feeding in the valleys  and i was upon the rocks  they took no notice of me  from whence i concluded that  by the position of their optics  their sight was so directed downward that they did not readily see objects that were above them  so afterwards i took this method i always climbed the rocks first  to get above them  and then had frequently a fair mark",-2.35,0,-8,-2
"445","the first shot i made among these creatures  i killed a she goat  which had a little kid by her  which she gave suck to  which grieved me heartily  for when the old one fell  the kid stood stock still by her  till i came and took her up  and not only so  but when i carried the old one with me  upon my shoulders  the kid followed me quite to my enclosure  upon which i laid down the dam  and took the kid in my arms  and carried it over my pale  in hopes to have bred it up tame  but it would not eat  so i was forced to kill it and eat it myself",-3.3,-4,-10,-3
"446","these two supplied me with flesh a great while  for i ate sparingly  and saved my provisions  my bread especially  as much as possibly i could",1.3,1,5,0
"447","having now fixed my habitation  i found it absolutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in  and fuel to burn  and what i did for that  and also how i enlarged my cave  and what conveniences i made  i shall give a full account of in its place  but i must now give some little account of myself  and of my thoughts about living  which  it may well be supposed  were not a few",1.55,-1,-2,3
"448","i had a dismal prospect of my condition  for as i was not cast away upon that island without being driven  as is said  by a violent storm  quite out of the course of our intended voyage  and a great way  viz  some hundreds of leagues  out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind  i had great reason to consider it as a determination of heaven  that in this desolate place  and in this desolate manner  i should end my life",1.2,-1,1,1
"449","the tears would run plentifully down my face when i made these reflections  and sometimes i would expostulate with myself why providence should thus completely ruin his creatures  and render them so absolutely miserable  so without help  abandoned  so entirely depressed  that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life",-1.8,0,-7,0
"450","but something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts  and to reprove me  and particularly one day  walking with my gun in my hand by the seaside  i was very pensive upon the subject of my present condition  when reason  as it were  expostulated with me the other way  thus  well  you are in a desolate condition  it is true  but  pray remember  where are the rest of you",1.5,0,3,4
"451","did not you come  eleven of you in the boat",0,0,0,0
"452","where are the ten",0,0,0,0
"453","why were they not saved  and you lost",0.05,-1,-1,-1
"454","why were you singled out",0,0,0,0
"455","is it better to be here or there",0.8,1,2,0
"456","and then i pointed to the sea",0,0,0,1
"457","all evils are to be considered with the good that is in them  and with what worse attends them",-1,-1,0,0
"458","then it occurred to me again  how well i was furnished for my subsistence  and what would have been my case if it had not happened  which was a hundred thousand to one  that the ship floated from the place where she first struck  and was driven so near to the shore that i had time to get all these things out of her  what would have been my case  if i had been forced to have lived in the condition in which i at first came on shore  without necessaries of life  or necessaries to supply and procure them",-0.45,0,-2,0
"459","particularly  said i  aloud  though to myself   what should i have done without a gun  without ammunition  without any tools to make anything  or to work with  without clothes  bedding  a tent  or any manner of covering",-0.25,1,-1,-1
"460","and that now i had all these to sufficient quantity  and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my gun  when my ammunition was spent  so that i had a tolerable view of subsisting  without any want  as long as i lived  for i considered from the beginning how i would provide for the accidents that might happen  and for the time that was to come  even not only after my ammunition should be spent  but even after my health and strength should decay",2,2,2,0
"461","i confess i had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being destroyed at one blast i mean my powder being blown up by lightning  and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me  when it lightened and thundered  as i observed just now",-1.15,-1,-3,0
"462","and now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life  such  perhaps  as was never heard of in the world before  i shall take it from its beginning  and continue it in its order",-0.25,0,-2,0
"463","it was by my account the th of september  when  in the manner as above said  i first set foot upon this horrid island  when the sun  being to us in its autumnal equinox  was almost over my head  for i reckoned myself  by observation  to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty two minutes north of the line",0.1,-1,-3,0
"464","after i had been there about ten or twelve days  it came into my thoughts that i should lose my reckoning of time for want of books  and pen and ink  and should even forget the sabbath days  but to prevent this  i cut with my knife upon a large post  in capital letters and making it into a great cross  i set it up on the shore where i first landed i came on shore here on the th september",-1.15,-1,1,-2
"465","upon the sides of this square post i cut every day a notch with my knife  and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest  and every first day of the month as long again as that long one  and thus i kept my calendar  or weekly  monthly  and yearly reckoning of time",-0.65,-1,-1,1
"466","in the next place  we are to observe that among the many things which i brought out of the ship  in the several voyages which  as above mentioned  i made to it  i got several things of less value  but not at all less useful to me  which i omitted setting down before  as  in particular  pens  ink  and paper  several parcels in the captain s  mate s  gunner s and carpenter s keeping  three or four compasses  some mathematical instruments  dials  perspectives  charts  and books of navigation  all which i huddled together  whether i might want them or no  also  i found three very good bibles  which came to me in my cargo from england  and which i had packed up among my things  some portuguese books also  and among them two or three popish prayer books  and several other books  all which i carefully secured",3.5,2,9,5
"467","and i must not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats  of whose eminent history i may have occasion to say something in its place  for i carried both the cats with me  and as for the dog  he jumped out of the ship of himself  and swam on shore to me the day after i went on shore with my first cargo  and was a trusty servant to me many years  i wanted nothing that he could fetch me  nor any company that he could make up to me  i only wanted to have him talk to me  but that would not do",0.9,2,-1,1
"468","as i observed before  i found pens  ink  and paper  and i husbanded them to the utmost  and i shall show that while my ink lasted  i kept things very exact  but after that was gone i could not  for i could not make any ink by any means that i could devise",1,0,0,1
"469","and this put me in mind that i wanted many things notwithstanding all that i had amassed together  and of these  ink was one  as also a spade  pickaxe  and shovel  to dig or remove the earth  needles  pins  and thread  as for linen  i soon learned to want that without much difficulty",-0.75,-2,1,-2
"470","this want of tools made every work i did go on heavily  and it was near a whole year before i had entirely finished my little pale  or surrounded my habitation",-0.35,0,1,-1
"471","the piles  or stakes  which were as heavy as i could well lift  were a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods  and more  by far  in bringing home  so that i spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts  and a third day in driving it into the ground  for which purpose i got a heavy piece of wood at first  but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows  which  however  though i found it  made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work",0.1,1,-1,-3
"472","but what need i have been concerned at the tediousness of anything i had to do  seeing i had time enough to do it in",-0.85,0,-2,0
"473","nor had i any other employment  if that had been over  at least that i could foresee  except the ranging the island to seek for food  which i did  more or less  every day",0.4,0,0,2
"474","i now began to consider seriously my condition  and the circumstances i was reduced to  and i drew up the state of my affairs in writing  not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me for i was likely to have but few heirs as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over them  and afflicting my mind  and as my reason began now to master my despondency  i began to comfort myself as well as i could  and to set the good against the evil  that i might have something to distinguish my case from worse  and i stated very impartially  like debtor and creditor  the comforts i enjoyed against the miseries i suffered  thus",0.95,2,2,-1
"475","evil",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"476","good",0.75,1,3,1
"477","i am cast upon a horrible  desolate island  void of all hope of recovery",-0.5,-1,-1,1
"478","but i am alive  and not drowned  as all my ship s company were",-0.3,0,-1,1
"479","i am singled out and separated  as it were  from all the world  to be miserable",-1,-1,-3,-1
"480","but i am singled out  too  from all the ship s crew  to be spared from death  and he that miraculously saved me from death can deliver me from this condition",1.05,0,0,-1
"481","i am divided from mankind a solitaire  one banished from human society",-0.6,0,0,-1
"482","but i am not starved  and perishing on a barren place  affording no sustenance",-2,-1,-3,-3
"483","i have no clothes to cover me",0,0,-1,0
"484","but i am in a hot climate  where  if i had clothes  i could hardly wear them",-0.25,1,0,-1
"485","i am without any defence  or means to resist any violence of man or beast",-1.6,0,-3,-3
"486","but i am cast on an island where i see no wild beasts to hurt me  as i saw on the coast of africa  and what if i had been shipwrecked there",-0.4,-2,-3,-1
"487","i have no soul to speak to or relieve me",1,0,0,0
"488","but god wonderfully sent the ship in near enough to the shore  that i have got out as many necessary things as will either supply my wants or enable me to supply myself  even as long as i live",1.1,2,5,4
"489","upon the whole  here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce any condition in the world so miserable but there was something negative or something positive to be thankful for in it  and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in this world  that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves from  and to set  in the description of good and evil  on the credit side of the account",0.65,0,1,0
"490","having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition  and given over looking out to sea  to see if i could spy a ship i say  giving over these things  i began to apply myself to arrange my way of living  and to make things as easy to me as i could",1.85,2,1,2
"491","i have already described my habitation  which was a tent under the side of a rock  surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables  but i might now rather call it a wall  for i raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs  about two feet thick on the outside  and after some time  i think it was a year and a half  i raised rafters from it  leaning to the rock  and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees  and such things as i could get  to keep out the rain  which i found at some times of the year very violent",0.25,-1,1,2
"492","i have already observed how i brought all my goods into this pale  and into the cave which i had made behind me",0,-2,0,1
"493","but i must observe  too  that at first this was a confused heap of goods  which  as they lay in no order  so they took up all my place  i had no room to turn myself  so i set myself to enlarge my cave  and work farther into the earth  for it was a loose sandy rock  which yielded easily to the labour i bestowed on it  and so when i found i was pretty safe as to beasts of prey  i worked sideways  to the right hand  into the rock  and then  turning to the right again  worked quite out  and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification",2.95,1,-4,4
"494","this gave me not only egress and regress  as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse  but gave me room to store my goods",0.1,-1,0,1
"495","and now i began to apply myself to make such necessary things as i found i most wanted  particularly a chair and a table  for without these i was not able to enjoy the few comforts i had in the world  i could not write or eat  or do several things  with so much pleasure without a table  so i went to work",3.7,3,7,3
"496","and here i must needs observe  that as reason is the substance and origin of the mathematics  so by stating and squaring everything by reason  and by making the most rational judgment of things  every man may be  in time  master of every mechanic art",1.7,2,0,5
"497","i had never handled a tool in my life  and yet  in time  by labour  application  and contrivance  i found at last that i wanted nothing but i could have made it  especially if i had had tools",0.6,0,0,1
"498","however  i made abundance of things  even without tools  and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet  which perhaps were never made that way before  and that with infinite labour",1.2,1,-1,1
"499","for example  if i wanted a board  i had no other way but to cut down a tree  set it on an edge before me  and hew it flat on either side with my axe  till i brought it to be thin as a plank  and then dub it smooth with my adze",-0.05,1,-3,1
"500","it is true  by this method i could make but one board out of a whole tree  but this i had no remedy for but patience  any more than i had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board  but my time or labour was little worth  and so it was as well employed one way as another",3.55,5,3,7
"501","however  i made me a table and a chair  as i observed above  in the first place  and this i did out of the short pieces of boards that i brought on my raft from the ship",0,0,0,0
"502","but when i had wrought out some boards as above  i made large shelves  of the breadth of a foot and a half  one over another all along one side of my cave  to lay all my tools  nails and ironwork on  and  in a word  to separate everything at large into their places  that i might come easily at them",-0.5,-2,0,0
"503","i knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that would hang up  so that  had my cave been to be seen  it looked like a general magazine of all necessary things  and had everything so ready at my hand  that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order  and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great",3.05,2,8,3
"504","and now it was that i began to keep a journal of every day s employment  for  indeed  at first i was in too much hurry  and not only hurry as to labour  but in too much discomposure of mind  and my journal would have been full of many dull things  for example  i must have said thus   th",-0.75,-1,-2,0
"505","after i had got to shore  and escaped drowning  instead of being thankful to god for my deliverance  having first vomited  with the great quantity of salt water which had got into my stomach  and recovering myself a little  i ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my head and face  exclaiming at my misery  and crying out  i was undone  undone  till  tired and faint  i was forced to lie down on the ground to repose  but durst not sleep for fear of being devoured",-4.25,-6,-7,-3
"506","some days after this  and after i had been on board the ship  and got all that i could out of her  yet i could not forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain and looking out to sea  in hopes of seeing a ship  then fancy at a vast distance i spied a sail  please myself with the hopes of it  and then after looking steadily  till i was almost blind  lose it quite  and sit down and weep like a child  and thus increase my misery by my folly",0.55,-1,3,0
"507","but having gotten over these things in some measure  and having settled my household staff and habitation  made me a table and a chair  and all as handsome about me as i could  i began to keep my journal  of which i shall here give you the copy  though in it will be told all these particulars over again  as long as it lasted  for having no more ink  i was forced to leave it off",0.85,1,0,-2

"606","during this time i made my rounds in the woods for game every day when the rain permitted me  and made frequent discoveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage  particularly  i found a kind of wild pigeons  which build  not as wood pigeons in a tree  but rather as house pigeons  in the holes of the rocks  and taking some young ones  i endeavoured to breed them up tame  and did so  but when they grew older they flew away  which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them  for i had nothing to give them  however  i frequently found their nests  and got their young ones  which were very good meat",2.85,1,8,6

"608","i had a small runlet or two  as i observed before  but i could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them  though i spent many weeks about it  i could neither put in the heads  or join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water  so i gave that also over",0.5,0,3,0

"610","i remembered the lump of beeswax with which i made candles in my african adventure  but i had none of that now  the only remedy i had was  that when i had killed a goat i saved the tallow  and with a little dish made of clay  which i baked in the sun  to which i added a wick of some oakum  i made me a lamp  and this gave me light  though not a clear  steady light  like a candle",3.25,3,4,2
"611","in the middle of all my labours it happened that  rummaging my things  i found a little bag which  as i hinted before  had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry not for this voyage  but before  as i suppose  when the ship came from lisbon",0.6,0,0,1
"612","the little remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats  and i saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust  and being willing to have the bag for some other use  i think it was to put powder in  when i divided it for fear of the lightning  or some such use   i shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification  under the rock",-0.85,-1,-2,-1
"613","it was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that i threw this stuff away  taking no notice  and not so much as remembering that i had thrown anything there  when  about a month after  or thereabouts  i saw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground  which i fancied might be some plant i had not seen  but i was surprised  and perfectly astonished  when  after a little longer time  i saw about ten or twelve ears come out  which were perfect green barley  of the same kind as our european nay  as our english barley",2.15,4,12,1
"614","it is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts on this occasion",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"615","i had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all  indeed  i had very few notions of religion in my head  nor had entertained any sense of anything that had befallen me otherwise than as chance  or  as we lightly say  what pleases god  without so much as inquiring into the end of providence in these things  or his order in governing events for the world",2.75,2,2,3
"616","but after i saw barley grow there  in a climate which i knew was not proper for corn  and especially that i knew not how it came there  it startled me strangely  and i began to suggest that god had miraculously caused his grain to grow without any help of seed sown  and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild  miserable place",0.0500000000000001,-1,-3,2
"617","this touched my heart a little  and brought tears out of my eyes  and i began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account  and this was the more strange to me  because i saw near it still  all along by the side of the rock  some other straggling stalks  which proved to be stalks of rice  and which i knew  because i had seen it grow in africa when i was ashore there",1.25,1,-1,3
"618","i not only thought these the pure productions of providence for my support  but not doubting that there was more in the place  i went all over that part of the island  where i had been before  peering in every corner  and under every rock  to see for more of it  but i could not find any",1.6,3,2,0
"619","at last it occurred to my thoughts that i shook a bag of chickens meat out in that place  and then the wonder began to cease  and i must confess my religious thankfulness to god s providence began to abate  too  upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common  though i ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous  for it was really the work of providence to me  that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled  when the rats had destroyed all the rest  as if it had been dropped from heaven  as also  that i should throw it out in that particular place  where  it being in the shade of a high rock  it sprang up immediately  whereas  if i had thrown it anywhere else at that time  it had been burnt up and destroyed",-0.15,3,0,3
"620","i carefully saved the ears of this corn  you may be sure  in their season  which was about the end of june  and  laying up every corn  i resolved to sow them all again  hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread",3.25,1,8,2
"621","but it was not till the fourth year that i could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat  and even then but sparingly  as i shall say afterwards  in its order  for i lost all that i sowed the first season by not observing the proper time  for i sowed it just before the dry season  so that it never came up at all  at least not as it would have done  of which in its place",0.6,0,-2,1
"622","besides this barley  there were  as above  twenty or thirty stalks of rice  which i preserved with the same care and for the same use  or to the same purpose to make me bread  or rather food  for i found ways to cook it without baking  though i did that also after some time",2,0,2,2

"629","the case was thus  as i was busy in the inside  behind my tent  just at the entrance into my cave  i was terribly frighted with a most dreadful  surprising thing indeed  for all on a sudden i found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave  and from the edge of the hill over my head  and two of the posts i had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner",-2.15,-6,-6,-4
"630","i was heartily scared  but thought nothing of what was really the because  only thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in  as some of it had done before  and for fear i should be buried in it i ran forward to my ladder  and not thinking myself safe there neither  i got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill  which i expected might roll down upon me  i had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground  than i plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake  for the ground i stood on shook three times at about eight minutes distance  with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth  and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood about half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terrible noise as i never heard in all my life",-1.55,-2,-4,1
"631","i perceived also the very sea was put into violent motion by it  and i believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the island",-0.65,0,-3,0
"632","i was so much amazed with the thing itself  having never felt the like  nor discoursed with any one that had  that i was like one dead or stupefied  and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick  like one that was tossed at sea  but the noise of the falling of the rock awakened me  as it were  and rousing me from the stupefied condition i was in  filled me with horror  and i thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods  and burying all at once  and this sunk my very soul within me a second time",-2.9,-3,-2,-1
"633","after the third shock was over  and i felt no more for some time  i began to take courage  and yet i had not heart enough to go over my wall again  for fear of being buried alive  but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down and disconsolate  not knowing what to do",-1,-1,-4,0
"634","all this while i had not the least serious religious thought  nothing but the common lord have mercy upon me  and when it was over that went away too",1,1,2,1
"635","while i sat thus  i found the air overcast and grow cloudy  as if it would rain",0.55,-1,0,1
"636","soon after that the wind arose by little and little  so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane  the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth  the shore was covered with the breach of the water  the trees were torn up by the roots  and a terrible storm it was",-3.8,-3,-10,-6
"637","this held about three hours  and then began to abate  and in two hours more it was quite calm  and began to rain very hard",0.5,0,1,1
"638","all this while i sat upon the ground very much terrified and dejected  when on a sudden it came into my thoughts  that these winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake  the earthquake itself was spent and over  and i might venture into my cave again",-3.3,-2,-5,-2
"639","with this thought my spirits began to revive  and the rain also helping to persuade me  i went in and sat down in my tent",1,2,4,1
"640","but the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it  and i was forced to go into my cave  though very much afraid and uneasy  for fear it should fall on my head",-4.2,-5,-12,-6
"641","this violent rain forced me to a new work viz  to cut a hole through my new fortification  like a sink  to let the water go out  which would else have flooded my cave",-1,-1,-3,-2
"642","after i had been in my cave for some time  and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow  i began to be more composed",0.5,-1,-3,1
"643","and now  to support my spirits  which indeed wanted it very much  i went to my little store  and took a small sup of rum  which  however  i did then and always very sparingly  knowing i could have no more when that was gone",1.35,1,1,2
"644","it continued raining all that night and great part of the next day  so that i could not stir abroad  but my mind being more composed  i began to think of what i had best do  concluding that if the island was subject to these earthquakes  there would be no living for me in a cave  but i must consider of building a little hut in an open place which i might surround with a wall  as i had done here  and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men  for i concluded  if i stayed where i was  i should certainly one time or other be buried alive",2.3,1,8,2
"645","with these thoughts  i resolved to remove my tent from the place where it stood  which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill  and which  if it should be shaken again  would certainly fall upon my tent  and i spent the two next days  being the th and th of april  in contriving where and how to remove my habitation",-0.4,-1,2,-4
"646","the fear of being swallowed up alive made me that i never slept in quiet  and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it  but still  when i looked about  and saw how everything was put in order  how pleasantly concealed i was  and how safe from danger  it made me very loath to remove",-1.7,-2,-2,-4
"647","in the meantime  it occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this  and that i must be contented to venture where i was  till i had formed a camp for myself  and had secured it so as to remove to it",1.05,0,2,0

"746","what i had received by the good instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series  for eight years  of seafaring wickedness  and a constant conversation with none but such as were  like myself  wicked and profane to the last degree",0.4,-2,2,1
"747","i do not remember that i had  in all that time  one thought that so much as tended either to looking upwards towards god  or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways  but a certain stupidity of soul  without desire of good  or conscience of evil  had entirely overwhelmed me  and i was all that the most hardened  unthinking  wicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be  not having the least sense  either of the fear of god in danger  or of thankfulness to god in deliverance",-2.7,-6,-6,-3
"748","in the relating what is already past of my story  this will be the more easily believed when i shall add  that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me  i never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of god  or that it was a just punishment for my sin my rebellious behaviour against my father or my present sins  which were great or so much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life",-1.6,-2,-2,0
"749","when i was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of africa  i never had so much as one thought of what would become of me  or one wish to god to direct me whither i should go  or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me  as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages",-1.8,-4,-6,-2
"750","but i was merely thoughtless of a god or a providence  acted like a mere brute  from the principles of nature  and by the dictates of common sense only  and  indeed  hardly that",-0.15,0,1,0
"751","when i was delivered and taken up at sea by the portugal captain  well used  and dealt justly and honourably with  as well as charitably  i had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts",1.8,2,0,2
"752","when  again  i was shipwrecked  ruined  and in danger of drowning on this island  i was as far from remorse  or looking on it as a judgment",-3,-4,-6,-3
"753","i only said to myself often  that i was an unfortunate dog  and born to be always miserable",-1.75,-2,-3,-2
"754","it is true  when i got on shore first here  and found all my ship s crew drowned and myself spared  i was surprised with a kind of ecstasy  and some transports of soul  which  had the grace of god assisted  might have come up to true thankfulness  but it ended where it began  in a mere common flight of joy  or  as i may say  being glad i was alive  without the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which had preserved me  and had singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were destroyed  or an inquiry why providence had been thus merciful unto me",5.5,8,13,12
"755","even just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have  after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck  which they drown all in the next bowl of punch  and forget almost as soon as it is over  and all the rest of my life was like it",0,1,3,-1
"756","even when i was afterwards  on due consideration  made sensible of my condition  how i was cast on this dreadful place  out of the reach of human kind  out of all hope of relief  or prospect of redemption  as soon as i saw but a prospect of living and that i should not starve and perish for hunger  all the sense of my affliction wore off  and i began to be very easy  applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply  and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition  as a judgment from heaven  or as the hand of god against me  these were thoughts which very seldom entered my head",1.65,4,2,5
"757","the growing up of the corn  as is hinted in my journal  had at first some little influence upon me  and began to affect me with seriousness  as long as i thought it had something miraculous in it  but as soon as ever that part of the thought was removed  all the impression that was raised from it wore off also  as i have noted already",1.75,0,1,3
"758","even the earthquake  though nothing could be more terrible in its nature  or more immediately directing to the invisible power which alone directs such things  yet no sooner was the first fright over  but the impression it had made went off also",-2.5,-3,-8,-2
"759","i had no more sense of god or his judgments much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from his hand than if i had been in the most prosperous condition of life",0.25,0,3,3
"760","but now  when i began to be sick  and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place itself before me  when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper  and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever  conscience  that had slept so long  began to awake  and i began to reproach myself with my past life  in which i had so evidently  by uncommon wickedness  provoked the justice of god to lay me under uncommon strokes  and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner",-4.35,-9,-9,-1
"761","these reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper  and in the violence  as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience  extorted some words from me like praying to god  though i cannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes  it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress",-2.8,-2,-8,-3
"762","my thoughts were confused  the convictions great upon my mind  and the horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the mere apprehensions  and in these hurries of my soul i knew not what my tongue might express",-3.5,-3,-5,-3
"763","but it was rather exclamation  such as  lord  what a miserable creature am i",-1.25,-1,-3,-2
"764","if i should be sick  i shall certainly die for want of help  and what will become of me",-1.5,-2,-2,-2
"765","then the tears burst out of my eyes  and i could say no more for a good while",-0.05,1,0,1
"766","in this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind  and presently his prediction  which i mentioned at the beginning of this story viz  that if i did take this foolish step  god would not bless me  and i would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery",2.5,1,2,5
"767","now  said i  aloud  my dear father s words are come to pass  god s justice has overtaken me  and i have none to help or hear me  i rejected the voice of providence  which had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein i might have been happy and easy  but i would neither see it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents",4,5,13,4
"768","i left them to mourn over my folly  and now i am left to mourn under the consequences of it",-2.2,-1,-2,-2
"769","i abused their help and assistance  who would have lifted me in the world  and would have made everything easy to me  and now i have difficulties to struggle with  too great for even nature itself to support  and no assistance  no help  no comfort  no advice",1.35,1,4,0
"770","then i cried out  lord  be my help  for i am in great distress",-1.5,0,1,-1

"778","after i had eaten i tried to walk  but found myself so weak that i could hardly carry a gun  for i never went out without that  so i went but a little way  and sat down upon the ground  looking out upon the sea  which was just before me  and very calm and smooth",0.95,1,-1,2

"798","now  as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very much  it occurred to my thought that the brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers  and i had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests  which was quite cured  and some also that was green  and not quite cured",-2,-1,-4,-1
"799","i went  directed by heaven no doubt  for in this chest i found a cure both for soul and body",1.65,1,0,0

"805","in the interval of this operation i took up the bible and began to read  but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading  at least at that time  only  having opened the book casually  the first words that occurred to me were these  call on me in the day of trouble  and i will deliver thee  and thou shalt glorify me",-0.9,-1,-4,-1
"806","these words were very apt to my case  and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them  though not so much as they did afterwards  for  as for being  delivered   the word had no sound  as i may say  to me  the thing was so remote  so impossible in my apprehension of things  that i began to say  as the children of israel did when they were promised flesh to eat  can god spread a table in the wilderness",0.55,-1,1,2

"812","i found presently it flew up into my head violently  but i fell into a sound sleep  and waked no more till  by the sun  it must necessarily be near three o clock in the afternoon the next day nay  to this hour i am partly of opinion that i slept all the next day and night  and till almost three the day after  for otherwise i know not how i should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the week  as it appeared some years after i had done  for if i had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line  i should have lost more than one day  but certainly i lost a day in my account  and never knew which way",-1.05,-4,-7,-3

"836","now i began to construe the words mentioned above  call on me  and i will deliver thee  in a different sense from what i had ever done before  for then i had no notion of anything being called  deliverance   but my being delivered from the captivity i was in  for though i was indeed at large in the place  yet the island was certainly a prison to me  and that in the worse sense in the world",-1.7,-2,-6,-1

"845","i learned from it also this  in particular  that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be  especially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind  for as the rain which came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms  so i found that rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in september and october",-1.15,-3,-3,-2

"852","on the banks of this brook i found many pleasant savannahs or meadows  plain  smooth  and covered with grass  and on the rising parts of them  next to the higher grounds  where the water  as might be supposed  never overflowed  i found a great deal of tobacco  green  and growing to a great and very strong stalk",3.2,4,9,3

"857","i contented myself with these discoveries for this time  and came back  musing with myself what course i might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which i should discover  but could bring it to no conclusion  for  in short  i had made so little observation while i was in the brazils  that i knew little of the plants in the field  at least  very little that might serve to any purpose now in my distress",1.35,1,0,0
"858","the next day  the sixteenth  i went up the same way again  and after going something further than i had gone the day before  i found the brook and the savannahs cease  and the country become more woody than before",0.6,0,0,1
"859","in this part i found different fruits  and particularly i found melons upon the ground  in great abundance  and grapes upon the trees",2.3,2,3,1
"860","the vines had spread  indeed  over the trees  and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime  very ripe and rich",0.85,1,2,2
"861","this was a surprising discovery  and i was exceeding glad of them  but i was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them  remembering that when i was ashore in barbary  the eating of grapes killed several of our englishmen  who were slaves there  by throwing them into fluxes and fevers",-0.45,-2,-5,3
"862","but i found an excellent use for these grapes  and that was  to cure or dry them in the sun  and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept  which i thought would be  as indeed they were  wholesome and agreeable to eat when no grapes could be had",5.05,4,4,6
"863","i spent all that evening there  and went not back to my habitation  which  by the way  was the first night  as i might say  i had lain from home",-0.25,0,0,-1
"864","in the night  i took my first contrivance  and got up in a tree  where i slept well  and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery  travelling nearly four miles  as i might judge by the length of the valley  keeping still due north  with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me",1.4,1,0,2
"865","at the end of this march i came to an opening where the country seemed to descend to the west  and a little spring of fresh water  which issued out of the side of the hill by me  ran the other way  that is  due east  and the country appeared so fresh  so green  so flourishing  everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring that it looked like a planted garden",2.9,4,3,4
"866","i descended a little on the side of that delicious vale  surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure  though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts  to think that this was all my own  that i was king and lord of all this country indefensibly  and had a right of possession  and if i could convey it  i might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in england",3.4,3,8,5
"867","i saw here abundance of cocoa trees  orange  and lemon  and citron trees  but all wild  and very few bearing any fruit  at least not then",0.35,-1,0,-2
"868","however  the green limes that i gathered were not only pleasant to eat  but very wholesome  and i mixed their juice afterwards with water  which made it very wholesome  and very cool and refreshing",3.35,4,4,6
"869","i found now i had business enough to gather and carry home  and i resolved to lay up a store as well of grapes as limes and lemons  to furnish myself for the wet season  which i knew was approaching",1.75,2,2,2
"870","in order to do this  i gathered a great heap of grapes in one place  a lesser heap in another place  and a great parcel of limes and lemons in another place  and taking a few of each with me  i travelled homewards  resolving to come again  and bring a bag or sack  or what i could make  to carry the rest home",0.6,0,5,0
"871","accordingly  having spent three days in this journey  i came home  so i must now call my tent and my cave   but before i got thither the grapes were spoiled  the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken them and bruised them  they were good for little or nothing  as to the limes  they were good  but i could bring but a few",-0.2,-2,0,1
"872","the next day  being the nineteenth  i went back  having made me two small bags to bring home my harvest  but i was surprised  when coming to my heap of grapes  which were so rich and fine when i gathered them  to find them all spread about  trod to pieces  and dragged about  some here  some there  and abundance eaten and devoured",0.8,2,3,0
"873","by this i concluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts  which had done this  but what they were i knew not",-0.25,-1,0,-1
"874","however  as i found there was no laying them up on heaps  and no carrying them away in a sack  but that one way they would be destroyed  and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight  i took another course  for i gathered a large quantity of the grapes  and hung upon the out branches of the trees  that they might cure and dry in the sun  and as for the limes and lemons  i carried as many back as i could well stand under",1,-1,-6,0
"875","when i came home from this journey  i contemplated with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley  and the pleasantness of the situation  the security from storms on that side of the water  and the wood  and concluded that i had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by far the worst part of the country",0.9,1,3,1
"876","upon the whole  i began to consider of removing my habitation  and looking out for a place equally safe as where now i was situate  if possible  in that pleasant  fruitful part of the island",2.85,3,4,4
"877","this thought ran long in my head  and i was exceeding fond of it for some time  the pleasantness of the place tempting me  but when i came to a nearer view of it  i considered that i was now by the seaside  where it was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage  and  by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other unhappy wretches to the same place  and though it was scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen  yet to enclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage  and to render such an affair not only improbable  but impossible  and that therefore i ought not by any means to remove",-2.7,-1,0,-5
"878","however  i was so enamoured of this place  that i spent much of my time there for the whole of the remaining part of the month of july  and though upon second thoughts  i resolved not to remove  yet i built me a little kind of a bower  and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence  being a double hedge  as high as i could reach  well staked and filled between with brushwood  and here i lay very secure  sometimes two or three nights together  always going over it with a ladder  so that i fancied now i had my country house and my sea coast house  and this work took me up to the beginning of august",3.25,3,9,2
"879","i had but newly finished my fence  and began to enjoy my labour  when the rains came on  and made me stick close to my first habitation  for though i had made me a tent like the other  with a piece of a sail  and spread it very well  yet i had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms  nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary",2.45,2,3,3
"880","about the beginning of august  as i said  i had finished my bower  and began to enjoy myself",0.75,1,2,2
"881","the rd of august  i found the grapes i had hung up perfectly dried  and  indeed  were excellent good raisins of the sun  so i began to take them down from the trees  and it was very happy that i did so  for the rains which followed would have spoiled them  and i had lost the best part of my winter food  for i had above two hundred large bunches of them",3.75,2,10,6
"882","no sooner had i taken them all down  and carried the most of them home to my cave  than it began to rain  and from hence  which was the th of august  it rained  more or less  every day till the middle of october  and sometimes so violently  that i could not stir out of my cave for several days",-0.75,-2,-4,0
"883","in this season i was much surprised with the increase of my family  i had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats  who ran away from me  or  as i thought  had been dead  and i heard no more tidings of her till  to my astonishment  she came home about the end of august with three kittens",-1.35,-2,-8,2
"884","this was the more strange to me because  though i had killed a wild cat  as i called it  with my gun  yet i thought it was quite a different kind from our european cats  but the young cats were the same kind of house breed as the old one  and both my cats being females  i thought it very strange",-0.85,-3,-3,0
"885","but from these three cats i afterwards came to be so pestered with cats that i was forced to kill them like vermin or wild beasts  and to drive them from my house as much as possible",-2,-1,-2,-4
"886","from the th of august to the th  incessant rain  so that i could not stir  and was now very careful not to be much wet",-0.25,-1,2,1
"887","in this confinement  i began to be straitened for food  but venturing out twice  i one day killed a goat  and the last day  which was the th  found a very large tortoise  which was a treat to me  and my food was regulated thus  i ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast  a piece of the goat s flesh  or of the turtle  for my dinner  broiled for  to my great misfortune  i had no vessel to boil or stew anything  and two or three of the turtle s eggs for my supper",0.95,-3,-3,1
"888","during this confinement in my cover by the rain  i worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave  and by degrees worked it on towards one side  till i came to the outside of the hill  and made a door or way out  which came beyond my fence or wall  and so i came in and out this way",-0.25,0,0,-1
"889","but i was not perfectly easy at lying so open  for  as i had managed myself before  i was in a perfect enclosure  whereas now i thought i lay exposed  and open for anything to come in upon me  and yet i could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear  the biggest creature that i had yet seen upon the island being a goat",0.05,1,4,-2
"890","sept",0,0,0,0
"891","i was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing",-0.75,-1,-2,-1
"892","i cast up the notches on my post  and found i had been on shore three hundred and sixty five days",0.6,0,0,1
"893","i kept this day as a solemn fast  setting it apart for religious exercise  prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious humiliation  confessing my sins to god  acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me  and praying to him to have mercy on me through jesus christ  and not having tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours  even till the going down of the sun  i then ate a biscuit cake and a bunch of grapes  and went to bed  finishing the day as i began it",1.2,1,-1,3
"894","i had all this time observed no sabbath day  for as at first i had no sense of religion upon my mind  i had  after some time  omitted to distinguish the weeks  by making a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath day  and so did not really know what any of the days were  but now  having cast up the days as above  i found i had been there a year  so i divided it into weeks  and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath  though i found at the end of my account i had lost a day or two in my reckoning",-0.15,-1,-4,1
"895","a little after this  my ink began to fail me  and so i contented myself to use it more sparingly  and to write down only the most remarkable events of my life  without continuing a daily memorandum of other things",0.65,0,0,1
"896","the rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me  and i learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly  but i bought all my experience before i had it  and this i am going to relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that i made",-0.2,-1,-1,1
"897","i have mentioned that i had saved the few ears of barley and rice  which i had so surprisingly found spring up  as i thought  of themselves  and i believe there were about thirty stalks of rice  and about twenty of barley  and now i thought it a proper time to sow it  after the rains  the sun being in its southern position  going from me",2.5,1,2,3
"898","accordingly  i dug up a piece of ground as well as i could with my wooden spade  and dividing it into two parts  i sowed my grain  but as i was sowing  it casually occurred to my thoughts that i would not sow it all at first  because i did not know when was the proper time for it  so i sowed about two thirds of the seed  leaving about a handful of each",1.55,1,0,1
"899","it was a great comfort to me afterwards that i did so  for not one grain of what i sowed this time came to anything  for the dry months following  the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown  it had no moisture to assist its growth  and never came up at all till the wet season had come again  and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown",2.3,2,6,3
"900","finding my first seed did not grow  which i easily imagined was by the drought  i sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial in  and i dug up a piece of ground near my new bower  and sowed the rest of my seed in february  a little before the vernal equinox  and this having the rainy months of march and april to water it  sprung up very pleasantly  and yielded a very good crop  but having part of the seed left only  and not daring to sow all that i had  i had but a small quantity at last  my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind",3.9,2,6,6
"901","but by this experiment i was made master of my business  and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow  and that i might expect two seed times and two harvests every year",0.9,2,0,3
"902","while this corn was growing i made a little discovery  which was of use to me afterwards",1.4,0,1,1
"903","as soon as the rains were over  and the weather began to settle  which was about the month of november  i made a visit up the country to my bower  where  though i had not been some months  yet i found all things just as i left them",1,0,0,2
"904","the circle or double hedge that i had made was not only firm and entire  but the stakes which i had cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long branches  as much as a willow tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head",-0.65,-1,-1,0
"905","i could not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from",-0.25,0,-1,1
"906","i was surprised  and yet very well pleased  to see the young trees grow  and i pruned them  and led them up to grow as much alike as i could  and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three years  so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty five yards in diameter  yet the trees  for such i might now call them  soon covered it  and it was a complete shade  sufficient to lodge under all the dry season",4.9,4,6,4
"907","this made me resolve to cut some more stakes  and make me a hedge like this  in a semi circle round my wall  i mean that of my first dwelling   which i did  and placing the trees or stakes in a double row  at about eight yards distance from my first fence  they grew presently  and were at first a fine cover to my habitation  and afterwards served for a defence also  as i shall observe in its order",1.3,1,5,-1
"908","i found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided  not into summer and winter  as in europe  but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons  which were generally thus  the half of february  the whole of march  and the half of april rainy  the sun being then on or near the equinox",0.95,0,-1,3
"909","the half of april  the whole of may  june  and july  and the half of august dry  the sun being then to the north of the line",0.6,0,0,2
"910","the half of august  the whole of september  and the half of october rainy  the sun being then come back",0.35,0,-1,2
"911","the half of october  the whole of november  december  and january  and the half of february dry  the sun being then to the south of the line",0.6,0,0,1
"912","the rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow  but this was the general observation i made",-0.25,-1,-1,1
"913","after i had found by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain  i took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand  that i might not be obliged to go out  and i sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months",0.3,0,0,0
"914","this time i found much employment  and very suitable also to the time  for i found great occasion for many things which i had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application  particularly i tried many ways to make myself a basket  but all the twigs i could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing",0.75,0,3,3
"915","it proved of excellent advantage to me now  that when i was a boy  i used to take great delight in standing at a basket maker s  in the town where my father lived  to see them make their wicker ware  and being  as boys usually are  very officious to help  and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those things  and sometimes lending a hand  i had by these means full knowledge of the methods of it  and i wanted nothing but the materials  when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence i cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the sallows  willows  and osiers in england  and i resolved to try",4.55,5,14,4
"916","accordingly  the next day i went to my country house  as i called it  and cutting some of the smaller twigs  i found them to my purpose as much as i could desire  whereupon i came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity  which i soon found  for there was great plenty of them",2.2,1,3,1
"917","these i set up to dry within my circle or hedge  and when they were fit for use i carried them to my cave  and here  during the next season  i employed myself in making  as well as i could  a great many baskets  both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything  as i had occasion  and though i did not finish them very handsomely  yet i made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose  thus  afterwards  i took care never to be without them  and as my wicker ware decayed  i made more  especially strong  deep baskets to place my corn in  instead of sacks  when i should come to have any quantity of it",4.7,2,8,-2
"918","having mastered this difficulty  and employed a world of time about it  i bestirred myself to see  if possible  how to supply two wants",-0.5,-1,0,0
"919","i had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid  except two runlets  which were almost full of rum  and some glass bottles some of the common size  and others which were case bottles  square  for the holding of water  spirits   c",0.25,0,-1,1
"920","i had not so much as a pot to boil anything  except a great kettle  which i saved out of the ship  and which was too big for such as i desired it viz  to make broth  and stew a bit of meat by itself",2.35,-1,8,-1
"921","the second thing i fain would have had was a tobacco pipe  but it was impossible to me to make one  however  i found a contrivance for that  too  at last",-0.15,-1,0,0
"922","i employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or piles  and in this wicker working all the summer or dry season  when another business took me up more time than it could be imagined i could spare",0.25,0,0,0
"923","i mentioned before that i had a great mind to see the whole island  and that i had travelled up the brook  and so on to where i built my bower  and where i had an opening quite to the sea  on the other side of the island",0.5,1,3,1
"924","i now resolved to travel quite across to the sea shore on that side  so  taking my gun  a hatchet  and my dog  and a larger quantity of powder and shot than usual  with two biscuit cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for my store  i began my journey",1,1,4,2
"925","when i had passed the vale where my bower stood  as above  i came within view of the sea to the west  and it being a very clear day  i fairly descried land whether an island or a continent i could not tell  but it lay very high  extending from the w  to the w s w  at a very great distance  by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off",1.5,3,4,3
"926","i could not tell what part of the world this might be  otherwise than that i knew it must be part of america  and  as i concluded by all my observations  must be near the spanish dominions  and perhaps was all inhabited by savages  where  if i had landed  i had been in a worse condition than i was now  and therefore i acquiesced in the dispositions of providence  which i began now to own and to believe ordered everything for the best  i say i quieted my mind with this  and left off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there",-0.6,-1,-1,-1
"927","besides  after some thought upon this affair  i considered that if this land was the spanish coast  i should certainly  one time or other  see some vessel pass or repass one way or other  but if not  then it was the savage coast between the spanish country and brazils  where are found the worst of savages  for they are cannibals or men eaters  and fail not to murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands",-2.95,-6,-7,-1
"928","with these considerations  i walked very leisurely forward",2.2,0,0,2
"929","i found that side of the island where i now was much pleasanter than mine the open or savannah fields sweet  adorned with flowers and grass  and full of very fine woods",2,2,4,3
"930","i saw abundance of parrots  and fain i would have caught one  if possible  to have kept it to be tame  and taught it to speak to me  i did  after some painstaking  catch a young parrot  for i knocked it down with a stick  and having recovered it  i brought it home  but it was some years before i could make him speak  however  at last i taught him to call me by name very familiarly",1,1,0,1
"931","but the accident that followed  though it be a trifle  will be very diverting in its place",-0.6,0,-3,-2
"932","i was exceedingly diverted with this journey",1,1,0,1
"933","i found in the low grounds hares  as i thought them to be  and foxes  but they differed greatly from all the other kinds i had met with  nor could i satisfy myself to eat them  though i killed several",1.7,0,-3,2
"934","but i had no need to be venturous  for i had no want of food  and of that which was very good too  especially these three sorts  viz  goats  pigeons  and turtle  or tortoise  which added to my grapes  leadenhall market could not have furnished a table better than i  in proportion to the company  and though my case was deplorable enough  yet i had great because for thankfulness that i was not driven to any extremities for food  but had rather plenty  even to dainties",1.7,3,8,0
"935","i never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day  or thereabouts  but i took so many turns and re turns to see what discoveries i could make  that i came weary enough to the place where i resolved to sit down all night  and then i either reposed myself in a tree  or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the ground  either from one tree to another  or so as no wild creature could come at me without waking me",0.1,-1,-1,-1
"936","as soon as i came to the sea shore  i was surprised to see that i had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island  for here  indeed  the shore was covered with innumerable turtles  whereas on the other side i had found but three in a year and a half",0.1,-1,-3,2
"937","here was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds  some which i had seen  and some which i had not seen before  and many of them very good meat  but such as i knew not the names of  except those called penguins",1.35,1,3,2
"938","i could have shot as many as i pleased  but was very sparing of my powder and shot  and therefore had more mind to kill a she goat if i could  which i could better feed on  and though there were many goats here  more than on my side the island  yet it was with much more difficulty that i could come near them  the country being flat and even  and they saw me much sooner than when i was on the hills",-0.1,0,2,-2
"939","i confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine  but yet i had not the least inclination to remove  for as i was fixed in my habitation it became natural to me  and i seemed all the while i was here to be as it were upon a journey  and from home",0.25,-1,1,0
"940","however  i travelled along the shore of the sea towards the east  i suppose about twelve miles  and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark  i concluded i would go home again  and that the next journey i took should be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling  and so round till i came to my post again",0.9,1,3,2
"941","i took another way to come back than that i went  thinking i could easily keep all the island so much in my view that i could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country  but i found myself mistaken  for being come about two or three miles  i found myself descended into a very large valley  but so surrounded with hills  and those hills covered with wood  that i could not see which was my way by any direction but that of the sun  nor even then  unless i knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the day",1,-1,-4,1
"942","it happened  to my further misfortune  that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while i was in the valley  and not being able to see the sun  i wandered about very uncomfortably  and at last was obliged to find the seaside  look for my post  and come back the same way i went  and then  by easy journeys  i turned homeward  the weather being exceeding hot  and my gun  ammunition  hatchet  and other things very heavy",-0.6,0,-2,-1
"943","in this journey my dog surprised a young kid  and seized upon it  and i  running in to take hold of it  caught it  and saved it alive from the dog",1.5,0,3,3
"944","i had a great mind to bring it home if i could  for i had often been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two  and so raise a breed of tame goats  which might supply me when my powder and shot should be all spent",-0.15,1,3,-1
"945","i made a collar for this little creature  and with a string  which i made of some rope yarn  which i always carried about me  i led him along  though with some difficulty  till i came to my bower  and there i enclosed him and left him  for i was very impatient to be at home  from whence i had been absent above a month",-1.95,-1,-2,-4
"946","i cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old hutch  and lie down in my hammock bed",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"947","this little wandering journey  without settled place of abode  had been so unpleasant to me  that my own house  as i called it to myself  was a perfect settlement to me compared to that  and it rendered everything about me so comfortable  that i resolved i would never go a great way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the island",2,2,9,1
"948","i reposed myself here a week  to rest and regale myself after my long journey  during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for my poll  who began now to be a mere domestic  and to be well acquainted with me",0.35,1,0,1
"949","then i began to think of the poor kid which i had penned in within my little circle  and resolved to go and fetch it home  or give it some food  accordingly i went  and found it where i left it  for indeed it could not get out  but was almost starved for want of food",0.85,-1,-1,1
"950","i went and cut boughs of trees  and branches of such shrubs as i could find  and threw it over  and having fed it  i tied it as i did before  to lead it away  but it was so tame with being hungry  that i had no need to have tied it  for it followed me like a dog  and as i continually fed it  the creature became so loving  so gentle  and so fond  that it became from that time one of my domestics also  and would never leave me afterwards",2,5,3,-1
"951","the rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come  and i kept the th of september in the same solemn manner as before  being the anniversary of my landing on the island  having now been there two years  and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day i came there  i spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with  and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable",1.8,1,2,1
"952","i gave humble and hearty thanks that god had been pleased to discover to me that it was possible i might be more happy in this solitary condition than i should have been in the liberty of society  and in all the pleasures of the world  that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state  and the want of human society  by his presence and the communications of his grace to my soul  supporting  comforting  and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here  and hope for his eternal presence hereafter",8.1,8,17,9
"953","it was now that i began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life i now led was  with all its miserable circumstances  than the wicked  cursed  abominable life i led all the past part of my days  and now i changed both my sorrows and my joys  my very desires altered  my affections changed their gusts  and my delights were perfectly new from what they were at my first coming  or  indeed  for the two years past",1.2,0,4,-2
"954","before  as i walked about  either on my hunting or for viewing the country  the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a sudden  and my very heart would die within me  to think of the woods  the mountains  the deserts i was in  and how i was a prisoner  locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean  in an uninhabited wilderness  without redemption",-3,-3,-8,-3
"955","in the midst of the greatest composure of my mind  this would break out upon me like a storm  and make me wring my hands and weep like a child",0.9,0,3,0
"956","sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work  and i would immediately sit down and sigh  and look upon the ground for an hour or two together  and this was still worse to me  for if i could burst out into tears  or vent myself by words  it would go off  and the grief  having exhausted itself  would abate",-3.45,-3,-11,-4
"957","but now i began to exercise myself with new thoughts  i daily read the word of god  and applied all the comforts of it to my present state",2.05,0,3,3
"958","one morning  being very sad  i opened the bible upon these words  i will never  never leave thee  nor forsake thee",-1.25,-2,-3,-3
"959","immediately it occurred that these words were to me  why else should they be directed in such a manner  just at the moment when i was mourning over my condition  as one forsaken of god and man",-1,-1,-1,-2
"960","well  then  said i  if god does not forsake me  of what ill consequence can it be  or what matters it  though the world should all forsake me  seeing on the other hand  if i had all the world  and should lose the favour and blessing of god  there would be no comparison in the loss",-0.45,0,1,-2
"961","from this moment i began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken  solitary condition than it was probable i should ever have been in any other particular state in the world  and with this thought i was going to give thanks to god for bringing me to this place",0.85,0,6,1
"962","i know not what it was  but something shocked my mind at that thought  and i durst not speak the words",-0.5,-1,-2,-1
"963","how canst thou become such a hypocrite  said i  even audibly  to pretend to be thankful for a condition which  however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with  thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from",1,1,2,1
"964","so i stopped there  but though i could not say i thanked god for being there  yet i sincerely gave thanks to god for opening my eyes  by whatever afflicting providences  to see the former condition of my life  and to mourn for my wickedness  and repent",-1.2,-1,2,0
"965","i never opened the bible  or shut it  but my very soul within me blessed god for directing my friend in england  without any order of mine  to pack it up among my goods  and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship",2.15,-1,2,4
"966","thus  and in this disposition of mind  i began my third year  and though i have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my works this year as the first  yet in general it may be observed that i was very seldom idle  but having regularly divided my time according to the several daily employments that were before me  such as  first  my duty to god  and the reading the scriptures  which i constantly set apart some time for thrice every day  secondly  the going abroad with my gun for food  which generally took me up three hours in every morning  when it did not rain  thirdly  the ordering  cutting  preserving  and cooking what i had killed or caught for my supply  these took up great part of the day",-0.1,-1,-3,4
"967","also  it is to be considered  that in the middle of the day  when the sun was in the zenith  the violence of the heat was too great to stir out  so that about four hours in the evening was all the time i could be supposed to work in  with this exception  that sometimes i changed my hours of hunting and working  and went to work in the morning  and abroad with my gun in the afternoon",0.75,3,-1,-1
"968","to this short time allowed for labour i desire may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work  the many hours which  for want of tools  want of help  and want of skill  everything i did took up out of my time",2.05,3,4,0
"969","for example  i was full two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf  which i wanted in my cave  whereas  two sawyers  with their tools and a saw pit  would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day",-0.25,-1,-1,2
"970","my case was this  it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down  because my board was to be a broad one",-0.25,0,-1,0
"971","this tree i was three days in cutting down  and two more cutting off the boughs  and reducing it to a log or piece of timber",0,0,-1,0
"972","with inexpressible hacking and hewing i reduced both the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to move  then i turned it  and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end  then  turning that side downward  cut the other side til i brought the plank to be about three inches thick  and smooth on both sides",0.1,2,-1,0
"973","any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work  but labour and patience carried me through that  and many other things",0.75,2,0,1
"974","i only observe this in particular  to show the reason why so much of my time went away with so little work viz  that what might be a little to be done with help and tools  was a vast labour and required a prodigious time to do alone  and by hand",0.75,2,0,2
"975","but notwithstanding this  with patience and labour i got through everything that my circumstances made necessary to me to do  as will appear by what follows",0.5,1,0,1
"976","i was now  in the months of november and december  expecting my crop of barley and rice",0,0,0,0
"977","the ground i had manured and dug up for them was not great  for  as i observed  my seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck  for i had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season",-0.25,0,0,0
"978","but now my crop promised very well  when on a sudden i found i was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts  which it was scarcely possible to keep from it  as  first  the goats  and wild creatures which i called hares  who  tasting the sweetness of the blade  lay in it night and day  as soon as it came up  and eat it so close  that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk",-0.8,-2,-8,-3
"979","this i saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a hedge  which i did with a great deal of toil  and the more  because it required speed",0.2,0,2,2
"980","however  as my arable land was but small  suited to my crop  i got it totally well fenced in about three weeks time  and shooting some of the creatures in the daytime  i set my dog to guard it in the night  tying him up to a stake at the gate  where he would stand and bark all night long  so in a little time the enemies forsook the place  and the corn grew very strong and well  and began to ripen apace",0.75,1,2,0
"981","but as the beasts ruined me before  while my corn was in the blade  so the birds were as likely to ruin me now  when it was in the ear  for  going along by the place to see how it throve  i saw my little crop surrounded with fowls  of i know not how many sorts  who stood  as it were  watching till i should be gone",-1.5,-2,-4,-2
"982","i immediately let fly among them  for i always had my gun with me  i had no sooner shot  but there rose up a little cloud of fowls  which i had not seen at all  from among the corn itself",-1.15,-1,-1,-2
"983","this touched me sensibly  for i foresaw that in a few days they would devour all my hopes  that i should be starved  and never be able to raise a crop at all  and what to do i could not tell  however  i resolved not to lose my corn  if possible  though i should watch it night and day",0.8,0,2,-3
"984","in the first place  i went among it to see what damage was already done  and found they had spoiled a good deal of it  but that as it was yet too green for them  the loss was not so great but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop if it could be saved",0.8,-1,0,2
"985","i stayed by it to load my gun  and then coming away  i could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me  as if they only waited till i was gone away  and the event proved it to be so  for as i walked off  as if i was gone  i was no sooner out of their sight than they dropped down one by one into the corn again",-1.5,0,-3,-1
"986","i was so provoked  that i could not have patience to stay till more came on  knowing that every grain that they ate now was  as it might be said  a peck loaf to me in the consequence  but coming up to the hedge  i fired again  and killed three of them",-0.75,-1,-6,2
"987","this was what i wished for  so i took them up  and served them as we serve notorious thieves in england hanged them in chains  for a terror to others",-2.75,-2,-5,-2
"988","it is impossible to imagine that this should have such an effect as it had  for the fowls would not only not come at the corn  but  in short  they forsook all that part of the island  and i could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there",-0.5,-2,0,-1
"989","this i was very glad of  you may be sure  and about the latter end of december  which was our second harvest of the year  i reaped my corn",2.15,1,3,2
"990","i was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down  and all i could do was to make one  as well as i could  out of one of the broadswords  or cutlasses  which i saved among the arms out of the ship",0.35,0,-1,-1
"991","however  as my first crop was but small  i had no great difficulty to cut it down  in short  i reaped it in my way  for i cut nothing off but the ears  and carried it away in a great basket which i had made  and so rubbed it out with my hands  and at the end of all my harvesting  i found that out of my half peck of seed i had near two bushels of rice  and about two bushels and a half of barley  that is to say  by my guess  for i had no measure at that time",1.15,0,1,0
"992","however  this was a great encouragement to me  and i foresaw that  in time  it would please god to supply me with bread",2.25,2,7,3
"993","and yet here i was perplexed again  for i neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn  or indeed how to clean it and part it  nor  if made into meal  how to make bread of it  and if how to make it  yet i knew not how to bake it",-0.5,-1,0,0
"994","these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store  and to secure a constant supply  i resolved not to taste any of this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next season  and in the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread",5.85,5,13,9
"995","it might be truly said  that now i worked for my bread",0.25,1,0,0
"996","i believe few people have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing  producing  curing  dressing  making  and finishing this one article of bread",0.9,-1,-1,2
"997","i  that was reduced to a mere state of nature  found this to my daily discouragement  and was made more sensible of it every hour  even after i had got the first handful of seed corn  which  as i have said  came up unexpectedly  and indeed to a surprise",1.25,-1,0,1
"998","first  i had no plough to turn up the earth no spade or shovel to dig it",0,-1,-1,0
"999","well  this i conquered by making me a wooden spade  as i observed before  but this did my work but in a wooden manner  and though it cost me a great many days to make it  yet  for want of iron  it not only wore out soon  but made my work the harder  and made it be performed much worse",0.8,1,1,0
"1000","however  this i bore with  and was content to work it out with patience  and bear with the badness of the performance",0,1,-5,0
"1001","when the corn was sown  i had no harrow  but was forced to go over it myself  and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it  to scratch it  as it may be called  rather than rake or harrow it",-1.1,-2,0,0
"1002","when it was growing  and grown  i have observed already how many things i wanted to fence it  secure it  mow or reap it  cure and carry it home  thrash  part it from the chaff  and save it",1.8,0,5,-1
"1003","then i wanted a mill to grind it  sieves to dress it  yeast and salt to make it into bread  and an oven to bake it  but all these things i did without  as shall be observed  and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too",0.65,2,4,2
"1004","all this  as i said  made everything laborious and tedious to me  but that there was no help for",-1.3,-1,1,-2
"1005","neither was my time so much loss to me  because  as i had divided it  a certain part of it was every day appointed to these works  and as i had resolved to use none of the corn for bread till i had a greater quantity by me  i had the next six months to apply myself wholly  by labour and invention  to furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations necessary for making the corn  when i had it  fit for my use",2.3,1,4,1
"1006","but first i was to prepare more land  for i had now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground",-0.15,1,0,2
"1007","before i did this  i had a week s work at least to make me a spade  which  when it was done  was but a sorry one indeed  and very heavy  and required double labour to work with it",-0.25,-1,-1,0
"1008","however  i got through that  and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground  as near my house as i could find them to my mind  and fenced them in with a good hedge  the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which i had set before  and knew it would grow  so that  in a year s time  i knew i should have a quick or living hedge  that would want but little repair",1.3,0,3,2
"1009","this work did not take me up less than three months  because a great part of that time was the wet season  when i could not go abroad",0.75,2,3,0
"1010","within doors  that is when it rained and i could not go out  i found employment in the following occupations always observing  that all the while i was at work i diverted myself with talking to my parrot  and teaching him to speak  and i quickly taught him to know his own name  and at last to speak it out pretty loud  poll  which was the first word i ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own",1.35,1,1,2
"1011","this  therefore  was not my work  but an assistance to my work  for now  as i said  i had a great employment upon my hands  as follows  i had long studied to make  by some means or other  some earthen vessels  which  indeed  i wanted sorely  but knew not where to come at them",1.05,1,3,0
"1012","however  considering the heat of the climate  i did not doubt but if i could find out any clay  i might make some pots that might  being dried in the sun  be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling  and to hold anything that was dry  and required to be kept so  and as this was necessary in the preparing corn  meal   c",-0.15,0,0,0
"1013","which was the thing i was doing  i resolved to make some as large as i could  and fit only to stand like jars  to hold what should be put into them",1.5,1,5,0
"1014","it would make the reader pity me  or rather laugh at me  to tell how many awkward ways i took to raise this paste  what odd  misshapen  ugly things i made  how many of them fell in and how many fell out  the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight  how many cracked by the over violent heat of the sun  being set out too hastily  and how many fell in pieces with only removing  as well before as after they were dried  and  in a word  how  after having laboured hard to find the clay to dig it  to temper it  to bring it home  and work it i could not make above two large earthen ugly things  i cannot call them jars  in about two months labour",-3.25,-8,-12,-1
"1015","however  as the sun baked these two very dry and hard  i lifted them very gently up  and set them down again in two great wicker baskets  which i had made on purpose for them  that they might not break  and as between the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare  i stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw  and these two pots being to stand always dry i thought would hold my dry corn  and perhaps the meal  when the corn was bruised",0.1,-2,2,2
"1016","though i miscarried so much in my design for large pots  yet i made several smaller things with better success  such as little round pots  flat dishes  pitchers  and pipkins  and any things my hand turned to  and the heat of the sun baked them quite hard",1.9,1,3,2
"1017","but all this would not answer my end  which was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid  and bear the fire  which none of these could do",-0.25,0,-2,0
"1018","it happened after some time  making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat  when i went to put it out after i had done with it  i found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire  burnt as hard as a stone  and red as a tile",-0.4,-1,-3,-1
"1019","i was agreeably surprised to see it  and said to myself  that certainly they might be made to burn whole  if they would burn broken",-0.15,-1,-1,-1
"1020","this set me to study how to order my fire  so as to make it burn some pots",-0.4,-1,-2,1
"1021","i had no notion of a kiln  such as the potters burn in  or of glazing them with lead  though i had some lead to do it with  but i placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile  one upon another  and placed my firewood all round it  with a great heap of embers under them",0.35,1,2,2
"1022","i plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon the top  till i saw the pots in the inside red hot quite through  and observed that they did not crack at all",-0.5,2,1,0
"1023","when i saw them clear red  i let them stand in that heat about five or six hours  till i found one of them  though it did not crack  did melt or run  for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat  and would have run into glass if i had gone on  so i slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the red colour  and watching them all night  that i might not let the fire abate too fast  in the morning i had three very good  i will not say handsome  pipkins  and two other earthen pots  as hard burnt as could be desired  and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand",2.15,3,6,-1
"1024","after this experiment  i need not say that i wanted no sort of earthenware for my use  but i must needs say as to the shapes of them  they were very indifferent  as any one may suppose  when i had no way of making them but as the children make dirt pies  or as a woman would make pies that never learned to raise paste",-1.25,-2,-5,-1
"1025","no joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine  when i found i had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire  and i had hardly patience to stay till they were cold before i set one on the fire again with some water in it to boil me some meat  which it did admirably well  and with a piece of a kid i made some very good broth  though i wanted oatmeal  and several other ingredients requisite to make it as good as i would have had it been",3.65,3,3,2
"1026","my next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn in  for as to the mill  there was no thought of arriving at that perfection of art with one pair of hands",0.1,0,2,2
"1027","to supply this want  i was at a great loss  for  of all the trades in the world  i was as perfectly unqualified for a stone cutter as for any whatever  neither had i any tools to go about it with",-0.25,0,4,-2
"1028","i spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow  and make fit for a mortar  and could find none at all  except what was in the solid rock  and which i had no way to dig or cut out  nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient  but were all of a sandy  crumbling stone  which neither would bear the weight of a heavy pestle  nor would break the corn without filling it with sand",0,1,4,-2
"1029","so  after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone  i gave it over  and resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood  which i found  indeed  much easier  and getting one as big as i had strength to stir  i rounded it  and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet  and then with the help of fire and infinite labour  made a hollow place in it  as the indians in brazil make their canoes",1.55,-1,1,1
"1030","after this  i made a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood called the iron wood  and this i prepared and laid by against i had my next crop of corn  which i proposed to myself to grind  or rather pound into meal to make bread",0.75,0,4,1
"1031","my next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce  to dress my meal  and to part it from the bran and the husk  without which i did not see it possible i could have any bread",-0.5,-1,0,-1
"1032","this was a most difficult thing even to think on  for to be sure i had nothing like the necessary thing to make it i mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through",0.25,1,3,0
"1033","and here i was at a full stop for many months  nor did i really know what to do",-0.4,0,-1,1
"1034","linen i had none left but what was mere rags  i had goat s hair  but neither knew how to weave it or spin it  and had i known how  here were no tools to work it with",0,1,-1,-1
"1035","all the remedy that i found for this was  that at last i did remember i had  among the seamen s clothes which were saved out of the ship  some neckcloths of calico or muslin  and with some pieces of these i made three small sieves proper enough for the work  and thus i made shift for some years  how i did afterwards  i shall show in its place",2.15,4,2,2
"1036","the baking part was the next thing to be considered  and how i should make bread when i came to have corn  for first  i had no yeast",0,0,-1,0
"1037","as to that part  there was no supplying the want  so i did not concern myself much about it",-0.6,-1,0,0
"1038","but for an oven i was indeed in great pain",-0.25,0,1,-1
"1039","at length i found out an experiment for that also  which was this  i made some earthen vessels very broad but not deep  that is to say  about two feet diameter  and not above nine inches deep",0.6,0,0,1
"1040","these i burned in the fire  as i had done the other  and laid them by  and when i wanted to bake  i made a great fire upon my hearth  which i had paved with some square tiles of my own baking and burning also  but i should not call them square",-0.15,-1,1,1
"1041","when the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals  i drew them forward upon this hearth  so as to cover it all over  and there i let them lie till the hearth was very hot",0.6,0,1,2
"1042","then sweeping away all the embers  i set down my loaf or loaves  and whelming down the earthen pot upon them  drew the embers all round the outside of the pot  to keep in and add to the heat  and thus as well as in the best oven in the world  i baked my barley loaves  and became in little time a good pastrycook into the bargain  for i made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice  but i made no pies  neither had i anything to put into them supposing i had  except the flesh either of fowls or goats",2.55,5,7,1
"1043","it need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of the third year of my abode here  for it is to be observed that in the intervals of these things i had my new harvest and husbandry to manage  for i reaped my corn in its season  and carried it home as well as i could  and laid it up in the ear  in my large baskets  till i had time to rub it out  for i had no floor to thrash it on  or instrument to thrash it with",2.9,0,-1,2
"1044","and now  indeed  my stock of corn increasing  i really wanted to build my barns bigger  i wanted a place to lay it up in  for the increase of the corn now yielded me so much  that i had of the barley about twenty bushels  and of the rice as much or more  insomuch that now i resolved to begin to use it freely  for my bread had been quite gone a great while  also i resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year  and to sow but once a year",3.7,2,6,3
"1045","upon the whole  i found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were much more than i could consume in a year  so i resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that i sowed the last  in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me with bread   c",3,0,4,3
"1046","all the while these things were doing  you may be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which i had seen from the other side of the island  and i was not without secret wishes that i were on shore there  fancying that  seeing the mainland  and an inhabited country  i might find some way or other to convey myself further  and perhaps at last find some means of escape",1.15,0,1,2
"1047","but all this while i made no allowance for the dangers of such an undertaking  and how i might fall into the hands of savages  and perhaps such as i might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of africa  that if i once came in their power  i should run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed  and perhaps of being eaten  for i had heard that the people of the caribbean coast were cannibals or man eaters  and i knew by the latitude that i could not be far from that shore",-1.8,-5,-7,-1
"1048","then  supposing they were not cannibals  yet they might kill me  as many europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served  even when they had been ten or twenty together much more i  that was but one  and could make little or no defence  all these things  i say  which i ought to have considered well  and did come into my thoughts afterwards  yet gave me no apprehensions at first  and my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore",-1.45,-1,-6,-1
"1049","now i wished for my boy xury  and the long boat with shoulder of mutton sail  with which i sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of africa  but this was in vain  then i thought i would go and look at our ship s boat  which  as i have said  was blown up upon the shore a great way  in the storm  when we were first cast away",0.1,0,3,0
"1050","she lay almost where she did at first  but not quite  and was turned  by the force of the waves and the winds  almost bottom upward  against a high ridge of beachy  rough sand  but no water about her",-0.85,-1,-1,-2
"1051","if i had had hands to have refitted her  and to have launched her into the water  the boat would have done well enough  and i might have gone back into the brazils with her easily enough  but i might have foreseen that i could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom than i could remove the island  however  i went to the woods  and cut levers and rollers  and brought them to the boat resolving to try what i could do  suggesting to myself that if i could but turn her down  i might repair the damage she had received  and she would be a very good boat  and i might go to sea in her very easily",2.1,2,1,2
"1052","i spared no pains  indeed  in this piece of fruitless toil  and spent  i think  three or four weeks about it  at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my little strength  i fell to digging away the sand  to undermine it  and so to make it fall down  setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall",-2.65,-6,-3,-4
"1053","but when i had done this  i was unable to stir it up again  or to get under it  much less to move it forward towards the water  so i was forced to give it over  and yet  though i gave over the hopes of the boat  my desire to venture over for the main increased  rather than decreased  as the means for it seemed impossible",1.2,-2,1,-1
"1054","this at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make myself a canoe  or periagua  such as the natives of those climates make  even without tools  or  as i might say  without hands  of the trunk of a great tree",0.5,1,3,1
"1055","this i not only thought possible  but easy  and pleased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it  and with my having much more convenience for it than any of the negroes or indians  but not at all considering the particular inconveniences which i lay under more than the indians did viz  want of hands to move it  when it was made  into the water a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to them  for what was it to me  if when i had chosen a vast tree in the woods  and with much trouble cut it down  if i had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat  and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow  so as to make a boat of it if  after all this  i must leave it just there where i found it  and not be able to launch it into the water",1.05,1,0,5
"1056","one would have thought i could not have had the least reflection upon my mind of my circumstances while i was making this boat  but i should have immediately thought how i should get it into the sea  but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it  that i never once considered how i should get it off the land  and it was really  in its own nature  more easy for me to guide it over forty five miles of sea than about forty five fathoms of land  where it lay  to set it afloat in the water",1.4,1,1,3
"1057","i went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did who had any of his senses awake",0,1,0,-1
"1058","i pleased myself with the design  without determining whether i was ever able to undertake it  not but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head  but i put a stop to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which i gave myself let me first make it  i warrant i will find some way or other to get it along when it is done",-0.9,-1,0,-1
"1059","this was a most preposterous method  but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed  and to work i went",0.9,2,0,2
"1060","i felled a cedar tree  and i question much whether solomon ever had such a one for the building of the temple of jerusalem  it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump  and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty two feet  after which it lessened for a while  and then parted into branches",-0.15,-1,0,2
"1061","it was not without infinite labour that i felled this tree  i was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom  i was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head cut off  which i hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet  and inexpressible labour  after this  it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion  and to something like the bottom of a boat  that it might swim upright as it ought to do",0.45,1,-1,4
"1062","it cost me near three months more to clear the inside  and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it  this i did  indeed  without fire  by mere mallet and chisel  and by the dint of hard labour  till i had brought it to be a very handsome periagua  and big enough to have carried six and twenty men  and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo",1.25,3,2,1
"1063","when i had gone through this work i was extremely delighted with it",1,2,3,1
"1064","the boat was really much bigger than ever i saw a canoe or periagua  that was made of one tree  in my life",0,0,0,1
"1065","many a weary stroke it had cost  you may be sure  and had i gotten it into the water  i make no question  but i should have begun the maddest voyage  and the most unlikely to be performed  that ever was undertaken",-1.5,-2,-4,-1
"1066","but all my devices to get it into the water failed me  though they cost me infinite labour too",0.1,-1,-2,1
"1067","it lay about one hundred yards from the water  and not more  but the first inconvenience was  it was up hill towards the creek",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"1068","well  to take away this discouragement  i resolved to dig into the surface of the earth  and so make a declivity  this i began  and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains  but who grudge pains who have their deliverance in view    but when this was worked through  and this difficulty managed  it was still much the same  for i could no more stir the canoe than i could the other boat",0.3,-1,1,-1
"1069","then i measured the distance of ground  and resolved to cut a dock or canal  to bring the water up to the canoe  seeing i could not bring the canoe down to the water",0.75,0,1,1
"1070","well  i began this work  and when i began to enter upon it  and calculate how deep it was to be dug  how broad  how the stuff was to be thrown out  i found that  by the number of hands i had  being none but my own  it must have been ten or twelve years before i could have gone through with it  for the shore lay so high  that at the upper end it must have been at least twenty feet deep  so at length  though with great reluctancy  i gave this attempt over also",2.15,3,3,1
"1071","this grieved me heartily  and now i saw  though too late  the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost  and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it",0.1,3,0,2
"1072","in the middle of this work i finished my fourth year in this place  and kept my anniversary with the same devotion  and with as much comfort as ever before  for  by a constant study and serious application to the word of god  and by the assistance of his grace  i gained a different knowledge from what i had before",3.95,4,8,8
"1073","i entertained different notions of things",0.5,0,0,1
"1074","i looked now upon the world as a thing remote  which i had nothing to do with  no expectations from  and  indeed  no desires about  in a word  i had nothing indeed to do with it  nor was ever likely to have  so i thought it looked  as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter viz  as a place i had lived in  but was come out of it  and well might i say  as father abraham to dives  between me and thee is a great gulf fixed",1.3,2,2,1
"1075","in the first place  i was removed from all the wickedness of the world here  i had neither the lusts of the flesh  the lusts of the eye  nor the pride of life",-0.25,0,0,0
"1076","i had nothing to covet  for i had all that i was now capable of enjoying  i was lord of the whole manor  or  if i pleased  i might call myself king or emperor over the whole country which i had possession of  there were no rivals  i had no competitor  none to dispute sovereignty or command with me  i might have raised ship loadings of corn  but i had no use for it  so i let as little grow as i thought enough for my occasion",1.65,3,3,1
"1077","i had tortoise or turtle enough  but now and then one was as much as i could put to any use  i had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships  and i had grapes enough to have made wine  or to have cured into raisins  to have loaded that fleet when it had been built",-0.5,1,0,1
"1078","but all i could make use of was all that was valuable  i had enough to eat and supply my wants  and what was all the rest to me",0.85,2,0,4
"1079","if i killed more flesh than i could eat  the dog must eat it  or vermin  if i sowed more corn than i could eat  it must be spoiled  the trees that i cut down were lying to rot on the ground  i could make no more use of them but for fuel  and that i had no occasion for but to dress my food",-2.35,-4,-7,-1
"1080","in a word  the nature and experience of things dictated to me  upon just reflection  that all the good things of this world are no farther good to us than they are for our use  and that  whatever we may heap up to give others  we enjoy just as much as we can use  and no more",1.5,2,4,3
"1081","the most covetous  griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he had been in my case  for i possessed infinitely more than i knew what to do with",-2.3,-3,0,-3
"1082","i had no room for desire  except it was of things which i had not  and they were but trifles  though  indeed  of great use to me  i had  as i hinted before  a parcel of money  as well gold as silver  about thirty six pounds sterling",3,3,5,2
"1083","alas  there the sorry  useless stuff lay  i had no more manner of business for it  and often thought with myself that i would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco pipes  or for a hand mill to grind my corn  nay  i would have given it all for a sixpenny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of england  or for a handful of peas and beans  and a bottle of ink",-2.4,-3,-5,-3
"1084","as it was  i had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it  but there it lay in a drawer  and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons  and if i had had the drawer full of diamonds  it had been the same case they had been of no manner of value to me  because of no use",1.5,1,3,2
"1085","i had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it was at first  and much easier to my mind  as well as to my body",1.6,2,0,0
"1086","i frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness  and admired the hand of god s providence  which had thus spread my table in the wilderness",1.1,1,4,1
"1087","i learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition  and less upon the dark side  and to consider what i enjoyed rather than what i wanted  and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts  that i cannot express them  and which i take notice of here  to put those discontented people in mind of it  who cannot enjoy comfortably what god has given them  because they see and covet something that he has not given them",2.9,2,8,1
"1088","all our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have",0,0,1,0
"1089","another reflection was of great use to me  and doubtless would be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was  and this was  to compare my present condition with what i at first expected it would be  nay  with what it would certainly have been  if the good providence of god had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore  where i not only could come at her  but could bring what i got out of her to the shore  for my relief and comfort  without which  i had wanted for tools to work  weapons for defence  and gunpowder and shot for getting my food",3.2,6,11,4
"1090","i spent whole hours  i may say whole days  in representing to myself  in the most lively colours  how i must have acted if i had got nothing out of the ship",0.5,1,2,-1
"1091","how i could not have so much as got any food  except fish and turtles  and that  as it was long before i found any of them  i must have perished first  that i should have lived  if i had not perished  like a mere savage  that if i had killed a goat or a fowl  by any contrivance  i had no way to flay or open it  or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels  or to cut it up  but must gnaw it with my teeth  and pull it with my claws  like a beast",-2.25,-1,-3,0
"1092","these reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of providence to me  and very thankful for my present condition  with all its hardships and misfortunes  and this part also i cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt  in their misery  to say  is any affliction like mine",1.85,3,7,3
"1093","let them consider how much worse the cases of some people are  and their case might have been  if providence had thought fit",0.25,0,-2,-2
"1094","i had another reflection  which assisted me also to comfort my mind with hopes  and this was comparing my present situation with what i had deserved  and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of providence",3.45,2,4,5
"1095","i had lived a dreadful life  perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of god",-1.4,-2,-1,-1
"1096","i had been well instructed by father and mother  neither had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse a religious awe of god into my mind  a sense of my duty  and what the nature and end of my being required of me",1.05,2,1,1
"1097","but  alas  falling early into the seafaring life  which of all lives is the most destitute of the fear of god  though his terrors are always before them  i say  falling early into the seafaring life  and into seafaring company  all that little sense of religion which i had entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates  by a hardened despising of dangers  and the views of death  which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with anything but what was like myself  or to hear anything that was good or tended towards it",-2.35,-4,3,-2
"1098","so void was i of everything that was good  or the least sense of what i was  or was to be  that  in the greatest deliverances i enjoyed such as my escape from sallee  my being taken up by the portuguese master of the ship  my being planted so well in the brazils  my receiving the cargo from england  and the like i never had once the words thank god  so much as on my mind  or in my mouth  nor in the greatest distress had i so much as a thought to pray to him  or so much as to say  lord  have mercy upon me  no  nor to mention the name of god  unless it was to swear by  and blaspheme it",3.9,6,10,6
"1099","i had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months  as i have already observed  on account of my wicked and hardened life past  and when i looked about me  and considered what particular providences had attended me since my coming into this place  and how god had dealt bountifully with me had not only punished me less than my iniquity had deserved  but had so plentifully provided for me this gave me great hopes that my repentance was accepted  and that god had yet mercy in store for me",-0.1,-2,2,-1
"1100","with these reflections i worked my mind up  not only to a resignation to the will of god in the present disposition of my circumstances  but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition  and that i  who was yet a living man  ought not to complain  seeing i had not the due punishment of my sins  that i enjoyed so many mercies which i had no reason to have expected in that place  that i ought never more to repine at my condition  but to rejoice  and to give daily thanks for that daily bread  which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought  that i ought to consider i had been fed even by a miracle  even as great as that of feeding elijah by ravens  nay  by a long series of miracles  and that i could hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world where i could have been cast more to my advantage  a place where  as i had no society  which was my affliction on one hand  so i found no ravenous beasts  no furious wolves or tigers  to threaten my life  no venomous creatures  or poisons  which i might feed on to my hurt  no savages to murder and devour me",-1.85,0,4,-4
"1101","in a word  as my life was a life of sorrow one way  so it was a life of mercy another  and i wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort but to be able to make my sense of god s goodness to me  and care over me in this condition  be my daily consolation  and after i did make a just improvement on these things  i went away  and was no more sad",3,2,7,6
"1102","i had now been here so long that many things which i had brought on shore for my help were either quite gone  or very much wasted and near spent",-1,-1,0,-2
"1103","my ink  as i observed  had been gone some time  all but a very little  which i eked out with water  a little and a little  till it was so pale  it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper",-1.35,-2,0,-2
"1104","as long as it lasted i made use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me  and first  by casting up times past  i remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences which befell me  and which  if i had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate  i might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity",3,1,3,4
"1105","first  i had observed that the same day that i broke away from my father and friends and ran away to hull  in order to go to sea  the same day afterwards i was taken by the sallee man of war  and made a slave  the same day of the year that i escaped out of the wreck of that ship in yarmouth roads  that same day year afterwards i made my escape from sallee in a boat  the same day of the year i was born on viz  the th of september  that same day i had my life so miraculously saved twenty six years after  when i was cast on shore in this island  so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on a day",-1.95,-3,-9,-4
"1106","the next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread i mean the biscuit which i brought out of the ship  this i had husbanded to the last degree  allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year  and yet i was quite without bread for near a year before i got any corn of my own  and great reason i had to be thankful that i had any at all  the getting it being  as has been already observed  next to miraculous",1.85,2,3,3
"1107","my clothes  too  began to decay  as to linen  i had had none a good while  except some chequered shirts which i found in the chests of the other seamen  and which i carefully preserved  because many times i could bear no other clothes on but a shirt  and it was a very great help to me that i had  among all the men s clothes of the ship  almost three dozen of shirts",1.6,1,9,2
"1108","there were also  indeed  several thick watch coats of the seamen s which were left  but they were too hot to wear  and though it is true that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes  yet i could not go quite naked no  though i had been inclined to it  which i was not nor could i abide the thought of it  though i was alone",-0.7,0,-4,-1
"1109","the reason why i could not go naked was  i could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on  nay  the very heat frequently blistered my skin  whereas  with a shirt on  the air itself made some motion  and whistling under the shirt  was twofold cooler than without it",2,1,0,1
"1110","no more could i ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat  the heat of the sun  beating with such violence as it does in that place  would give me the headache presently  by darting so directly on my head  without a cap or hat on  so that i could not bear it  whereas  if i put on my hat it would presently go away",-0.9,-1,-7,-2
"1111","upon these views i began to consider about putting the few rags i had  which i called clothes  into some order  i had worn out all the waistcoats i had  and my business was now to try if i could not make jackets out of the great watch coats which i had by me  and with such other materials as i had  so i set to work  tailoring  or rather  indeed  botching  for i made most piteous work of it",-1.4,1,0,-2
"1112","however  i made shift to make two or three new waistcoats  which i hoped would serve me a great while  as for breeches or drawers  i made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterwards",0.8,0,2,-1
"1113","i have mentioned that i saved the skins of all the creatures that i killed  i mean four footed ones  and i had them hung up  stretched out with sticks in the sun  by which means some of them were so dry and hard that they were fit for little  but others were very useful",1.55,-2,1,1
"1114","the first thing i made of these was a great cap for my head  with the hair on the outside  to shoot off the rain  and this i performed so well  that after i made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins that is to say  a waistcoat  and breeches open at the knees  and both loose  for they were rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm",1.8,3,1,-1
"1115","i must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made  for if i was a bad carpenter  i was a worse tailor",-2.75,-4,-6,-3
"1116","however  they were such as i made very good shift with  and when i was out  if it happened to rain  the hair of my waistcoat and cap being outermost  i was kept very dry",0.75,1,3,1
"1117","after this  i spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella  i was  indeed  in great want of one  and had a great mind to make one  i had seen them made in the brazils  where they are very useful in the great heats there  and i felt the heats every jot as great here  and greater too  being nearer the equinox  besides  as i was obliged to be much abroad  it was a most useful thing to me  as well for the rains as the heats",1.55,2,9,0
"1118","i took a world of pains with it  and was a great while before i could make anything likely to hold  nay  after i had thought i had hit the way  i spoiled two or three before i made one to my mind  but at last i made one that answered indifferently well  the main difficulty i found was to make it let down",0.2,-1,1,-2
"1119","i could make it spread  but if it did not let down too  and draw in  it was not portable for me any way but just over my head  which would not do",0.25,1,0,1
"1120","however  at last  as i said  i made one to answer  and covered it with skins  the hair upwards  so that it cast off the rain like a pent house  and kept off the sun so effectually  that i could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than i could before in the coolest  and when i had no need of it could close it  and carry it under my arm",2.6,4,6,3
"1121","thus i lived mighty comfortably  my mind being entirely composed by resigning myself to the will of god  and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his providence",2.15,3,2,2
"1122","this made my life better than sociable  for when i began to regret the want of conversation i would ask myself  whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts  and  as i hope i may say  with even god himself  by ejaculations  was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world",2.45,2,4,2
"1123","i cannot say that after this  for five years  any extraordinary thing happened to me  but i lived on in the same course  in the same posture and place  as before  the chief things i was employed in  besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice  and curing my raisins  of both which i always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one year s provisions beforehand  i say  besides this yearly labour  and my daily pursuit of going out with my gun  i had one labour  to make a canoe  which at last i finished  so that  by digging a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep  i brought it into the creek  almost half a mile",0.35,3,-1,0
"1124","as for the first  which was so vastly big  for i made it without considering beforehand  as i ought to have done  how i should be able to launch it  so  never being able to bring it into the water  or bring the water to it  i was obliged to let it lie where it was as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser the next time  indeed  the next time  though i could not get a tree proper for it  and was in a place where i could not get the water to it at any less distance than  as i have said  near half a mile  yet  as i saw it was practicable at last  i never gave it over  and though i was near two years about it  yet i never grudged my labour  in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last",1.15,0,3,4
"1125","however  though my little periagua was finished  yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the design which i had in view when i made the first  i mean of venturing over to the  terra firma   where it was above forty miles broad  accordingly  the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design  and now i thought no more of it",0.25,0,-1,0
"1126","as i had a boat  my next design was to make a cruise round the island  for as i had been on the other side in one place  crossing  as i have already described it  over the land  so the discoveries i made in that little journey made me very eager to see other parts of the coast  and now i had a boat  i thought of nothing but sailing round the island",1.75,1,2,4
"1127","for this purpose  that i might do everything with discretion and consideration  i fitted up a little mast in my boat  and made a sail too out of some of the pieces of the ship s sails which lay in store  and of which i had a great stock by me",1.5,1,3,2
"1128","having fitted my mast and sail  and tried the boat  i found she would sail very well  then i made little lockers or boxes at each end of my boat  to put provisions  necessaries  ammunition   c",1.8,1,0,1
"1129","into  to be kept dry  either from rain or the spray of the sea  and a little  long  hollow place i cut in the inside of the boat  where i could lay my gun  making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry",-1.5,-2,-3,-2
"1130","i fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern  like a mast  to stand over my head  and keep the heat of the sun off me  like an awning  and thus i every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea  but never went far out  nor far from the little creek",0.35,0,2,1
"1131","at last  being eager to view the circumference of my little kingdom  i resolved upon my cruise  and accordingly i victualled my ship for the voyage  putting in two dozen of loaves  cakes i should call them  of barley bread  an earthen pot full of parched rice  a food i ate a good deal of   a little bottle of rum  half a goat  and powder and shot for killing more  and two large watch coats  of those which  as i mentioned before  i had saved out of the seamen s chests  these i took  one to lie upon  and the other to cover me in the night",2.15,0,6,2
"1132","it was the th of november  in the sixth year of my reign or my captivity  which you please that i set out on this voyage  and i found it much longer than i expected  for though the island itself was not very large  yet when i came to the east side of it  i found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea  some above water  some under it  and beyond that a shoal of sand  lying dry half a league more  so that i was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point",0.75,-1,4,0
"1133","when i first discovered them  i was going to give over my enterprise  and come back again  not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea  and above all  doubting how i should get back again  so i came to an anchor  for i had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grappling which i got out of the ship",-0.25,-1,0,1
"1134","having secured my boat  i took my gun and went on shore  climbing up a hill  which seemed to overlook that point where i saw the full extent of it  and resolved to venture",0.65,-1,3,0
"1135","in my viewing the sea from that hill where i stood  i perceived a strong  and indeed a most furious current  which ran to the east  and even came close to the point  and i took the more notice of it because i saw there might be some danger that when i came into it i might be carried out to sea by the strength of it  and not be able to make the island again  and indeed  had i not got first upon this hill  i believe it would have been so  for there was the same current on the other side the island  only that it set off at a further distance  and i saw there was a strong eddy under the shore  so i had nothing to do but to get out of the first current  and i should presently be in an eddy",-0.75,-1,-1,0
"1136","i lay here  however  two days  because the wind blowing pretty fresh at ese",1.25,2,2,1
"1137","and that being just contrary to the current  made a great breach of the sea upon the point  so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the breach  nor to go too far off  because of the stream",-0.1,1,2,0
"1138","the third day  in the morning  the wind having abated overnight  the sea was calm  and i ventured  but i am a warning to all rash and ignorant pilots  for no sooner was i come to the point  when i was not even my boat s length from the shore  but i found myself in a great depth of water  and a current like the sluice of a mill  it carried my boat along with it with such violence that all i could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it  but i found it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy  which was on my left hand",-1.15,0,-4,0
"1139","there was no wind stirring to help me  and all i could do with my paddles signified nothing  and now i began to give myself over for lost  for as the current was on both sides of the island  i knew in a few leagues distance they must join again  and then i was irrecoverably gone  nor did i see any possibility of avoiding it  so that i had no prospect before me but of perishing  not by the sea  for that was calm enough  but of starving from hunger",-2.5,0,-2,1
"1140","i had  indeed  found a tortoise on the shore  as big almost as i could lift  and had tossed it into the boat  and i had a great jar of fresh water  that is to say  one of my earthen pots  but what was all this to being driven into the vast ocean  where  to be sure  there was no shore  no mainland or island  for a thousand leagues at least",1.85,2,4,1
"1141","and now i saw how easy it was for the providence of god to make even the most miserable condition of mankind worse",0.05,0,-4,-1
"1142","now i looked back upon my desolate  solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again",2.05,1,7,2
"1143","i stretched out my hands to it  with eager wishes o happy desert  said i  i shall never see thee more",1.8,1,6,1
"1144","o miserable creature  whither am going",-1.25,-1,-3,-2
"1145","then i reproached myself with my unthankful temper  and that i had repined at my solitary condition  and now what would i give to be on shore there again",-0.5,-1,0,0
"1146","thus  we never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries  nor know how to value what we enjoy  but by the want of it",1.25,1,5,2
"1147","it is scarcely possible to imagine the consternation i was now in  being driven from my beloved island  for so it appeared to me now to be  into the wide ocean  almost two leagues  and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again",-1.1,-2,0,-3
"1148","however  i worked hard till  indeed  my strength was almost exhausted  and kept my boat as much to the northward  that is  towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on  as possibly i could  when about noon  as the sun passed the meridian  i thought i felt a little breeze of wind in my face  springing up from sse",0.45,0,-1,1
"1149","this cheered my heart a little  and especially when  in about half an hour more  it blew a pretty gentle gale",2.55,2,3,1
"1150","by this time i had got at a frightful distance from the island  and had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened  i had been undone another way  too  for i had no compass on board  and should never have known how to have steered towards the island  if i had but once lost sight of it  but the weather continuing clear  i applied myself to get up my mast again  and spread my sail  standing away to the north as much as possible  to get out of the current",-1.5,-4,-3,-1
"1151","just as i had set my mast and sail  and the boat began to stretch away  i saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was near  for where the current was so strong the water was foul  but perceiving the water clear  i found the current abate  and presently i found to the east  at about half a mile  a breach of the sea upon some rocks  these rocks i found caused the current to part again  and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly  leaving the rocks to the north east  so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks  and made a strong eddy  which ran back again to the north west  with a very sharp stream",-0.2,-1,-4,1
"1152","they who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the ladder  or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them  or who have been in such extremities  may guess what my present surprise of joy was  and how gladly i put my boat into the stream of this eddy  and the wind also freshening  how gladly i spread my sail to it  running cheerfully before the wind  and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot",2.65,2,7,2
"1153","this eddy carried me about a league on my way back again  directly towards the island  but about two leagues more to the northward than the current which carried me away at first  so that when i came near the island  i found myself open to the northern shore of it  that is to say  the other end of the island  opposite to that which i went out from",0.85,0,0,2
"1154","when i had made something more than a league of way by the help of this current or eddy  i found it was spent  and served me no further",0.6,0,1,1
"1155","however  i found that being between two great currents viz  that on the south side  which had hurried me away  and that on the north  which lay about a league on the other side  i say  between these two  in the wake of the island  i found the water at least still  and running no way  and having still a breeze of wind fair for me  i kept on steering directly for the island  though not making such fresh way as i did before",2.45,4,5,2
"1156","about four o clock in the evening  being then within a league of the island  i found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster stretching out  as is described before  to the southward  and casting off the current more southerly  had  of course  made another eddy to the north  and this i found very strong  but not directly setting the way my course lay  which was due west  but almost full north",0.35,0,0,2
"1157","however  having a fresh gale  i stretched across this eddy  slanting north west  and in about an hour came within about a mile of the shore  where  it being smooth water  i soon got to land",1.1,2,1,1
"1158","when i was on shore  god i fell on my knees and gave god thanks for my deliverance  resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat  and refreshing myself with such things as i had  i brought my boat close to the shore  in a little cove that i had spied under some trees  and laid me down to sleep  being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage",0.35,-1,3,1
"1159","i was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat",-0.25,0,0,-1
"1160","i had run so much hazard  and knew too much of the case  to think of attempting it by the way i went out  and what might be at the other side  i mean the west side  i knew not  nor had i any mind to run any more ventures  so i resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the shore  and to see if there was no creek where i might lay up my frigate in safety  so as to have her again if i wanted her",0.9,-1,2,-2
"1161","in about three miles or thereabouts  coasting the shore  i came to a very good inlet or bay  about a mile over  which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook  where i found a very convenient harbour for my boat  and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her",2.15,2,3,3
"1162","here i put in  and having stowed my boat very safe  i went on shore to look about me  and see where i was",0.75,1,1,1
"1163","i soon found i had but a little passed by the place where i had been before  when i travelled on foot to that shore  so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and umbrella  for it was exceedingly hot  i began my march",0.45,2,-1,1
"1164","the way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as i had been upon  and i reached my old bower in the evening  where i found everything standing as i left it  for i always kept it in good order  being  as i said before  my country house",1.6,3,6,3
"1165","i got over the fence  and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs  for i was very weary  and fell asleep  but judge you  if you can  that read my story  what a surprise i must be in when i was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times  robin  robin  robin crusoe  poor robin crusoe",-1.15,-3,-4,0

"1175","first  i was amazed how the creature got thither  and then  how he should just keep about the place  and nowhere else  but as i was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest poll  i got over it  and holding out my hand  and calling him by his name  poll  the sociable creature came to me  and sat upon my thumb  as he used to do  and continued talking to me  poor robin crusoe  and how did i come here",2.8,4,4,2
"1176","and where had i been",0,0,0,0
"1177","just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again  and so i carried him home along with me",0.75,1,4,1
"1178","i had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time  and had enough to do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger i had been in",-1.1,0,-2,-1
"1179","i would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island  but i knew not how it was practicable to get it about",0.75,1,3,1
"1180","as to the east side of the island  which i had gone round  i knew well enough there was no venturing that way  my very heart would shrink  and my very blood run chill  but to think of it  and as to the other side of the island  i did not know how it might be there  but supposing the current ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the other  i might run the same risk of being driven down the stream  and carried by the island  as i had been before of being carried away from it  so with these thoughts  i contented myself to be without any boat  though it had been the product of so many months labour to make it  and of so many more to get it into the sea",-0.65,0,-3,-2
"1181","in this government of my temper i remained near a year  and lived a very sedate  retired life  as you may well suppose  and my thoughts being very much composed as to my condition  and fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispositions of providence  i thought i lived really very happily in all things except that of society",1.5,2,-1,2
"1182","i improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself to  and i believe i should  upon occasion  have made a very good carpenter  especially considering how few tools i had",1.5,2,5,2
"1183","besides this  i arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware  and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel  which i found infinitely easier and better  because i made things round and shaped  which before were filthy things indeed to look on",2.85,2,3,1
"1184","but i think i was never more vain of my own performance  or more joyful for anything i found out  than for my being able to make a tobacco pipe  and though it was a very ugly  clumsy thing when it was done  and only burned red  like other earthenware  yet as it was hard and firm  and would draw the smoke  i was exceedingly comforted with it  for i had been always used to smoke  and there were pipes in the ship  but i forgot them at first  not thinking there was tobacco in the island  and afterwards  when i searched the ship again  i could not come at any pipes",-0.75,-3,0,-1
"1185","in my wicker ware also i improved much  and made abundance of necessary baskets  as well as my invention showed me  though not very handsome  yet they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things up in  or fetching things home",4.45,6,5,2
"1186","for example  if i killed a goat abroad  i could hang it up in a tree  flay it  dress it  and cut it in pieces  and bring it home in a basket  and the like by a turtle  i could cut it up  take out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh  which was enough for me  and bring them home in a basket  and leave the rest behind me",-1,0,-3,1
"1187","also  large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn  which i always rubbed out as soon as it was dry and cured  and kept it in great baskets",0.5,1,3,0
"1188","i began now to perceive my powder abated considerably  this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply  and i began seriously to consider what i must do when i should have no more powder  that is to say  how i should kill any goats",-1.25,-2,-3,0
"1189","i had  as is observed in the third year of my being here  kept a young kid  and bred her up tame  and i was in hopes of getting a he goat  but i could not by any means bring it to pass  till my kid grew an old goat  and as i could never find in my heart to kill her  she died at last of mere age",-0.25,-2,-4,0
"1190","but being now in the eleventh year of my residence  and  as i have said  my ammunition growing low  i set myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats  to see whether i could not catch some of them alive  and particularly i wanted a she goat great with young",2.05,-1,4,3
"1191","for this purpose i made snares to hamper them  and i do believe they were more than once taken in them  but my tackle was not good  for i had no wire  and i always found them broken and my bait devoured",-0.55,-2,1,-1
"1192","at length i resolved to try a pitfall  so i dug several large pits in the earth  in places where i had observed the goats used to feed  and over those pits i placed hurdles of my own making too  with a great weight upon them  and several times i put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the trap  and i could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn  for i could see the marks of their feet",-0.2,0,4,0
"1193","at length i set three traps in one night  and going the next morning i found them  all standing  and yet the bait eaten and gone  this was very discouraging",-0.9,-2,-1,0
"1194","however  i altered my traps  and not to trouble you with particulars  going one morning to see my traps  i found in one of them a large old he goat  and in one of the others three kids  a male and two females",-0.4,-1,-3,0
"1195","as to the old one  i knew not what to do with him  he was so fierce i durst not go into the pit to him  that is to say  to bring him away alive  which was what i wanted",0,-1,1,0
"1196","i could have killed him  but that was not my business  nor would it answer my end  so i even let him out  and he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits",-0.4,-1,-3,0
"1197","but i did not then know what i afterwards learned  that hunger will tame a lion",-0.5,0,-2,1
"1198","if i had let him stay three or four days without food  and then have carried him some water to drink and then a little corn  he would have been as tame as one of the kids  for they are mighty sagacious  tractable creatures  where they are well used",1.95,2,0,2
"1199","however  for the present i let him go  knowing no better at that time  then i went to the three kids  and taking them one by one  i tied them with strings together  and with some difficulty brought them all home",1.15,0,1,1
"1200","it was a good while before they would feed  but throwing them some sweet corn  it tempted them  and they began to be tame",1.5,2,5,2
"1201","and now i found that if i expected to supply myself with goats flesh  when i had no powder or shot left  breeding some up tame was my only way  when  perhaps  i might have them about my house like a flock of sheep",0.7,1,1,1
"1202","but then it occurred to me that i must keep the tame from the wild  or else they would always run wild when they grew up  and the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground  well fenced either with hedge or pale  to keep them in so effectually  that those within might not break out  or those without break in",-0.3,-3,0,-1
"1203","this was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet  as i saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it  my first work was to find out a proper piece of ground  where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat  water for them to drink  and cover to keep them from the sun",2.2,3,3,4
"1204","those who understand such enclosures will think i had very little contrivance when i pitched upon a place very proper for all these  being a plain  open piece of meadow land  or savannah  as our people call it in the western colonies   which had two or three little drills of fresh water in it  and at one end was very woody i say  they will smile at my forecast  when i shall tell them i began by enclosing this piece of ground in such a manner that  my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles about",1.75,1,3,4
"1205","nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass  for if it was ten miles about  i was like to have time enough to do it in  but i did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as if they had had the whole island  and i should have so much room to chase them in that i should never catch them",-0.5,1,2,-3
"1206","my hedge was begun and carried on  i believe  about fifty yards when this thought occurred to me  so i presently stopped short  and  for the beginning  i resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty yards in length  and one hundred yards in breadth  which  as it would maintain as many as i should have in any reasonable time  so  as my stock increased  i could add more ground to my enclosure",1.2,0,2,0
"1207","this was acting with some prudence  and i went to work with courage",1.5,3,4,2
"1208","i was about three months hedging in the first piece  and  till i had done it  i tethered the three kids in the best part of it  and used them to feed as near me as possible  to make them familiar  and very often i would go and carry them some ears of barley  or a handful of rice  and feed them out of my hand  so that after my enclosure was finished and i let them loose  they would follow me up and down  bleating after me for a handful of corn",1.05,0,0,1
"1209","this answered my end  and in about a year and a half i had a flock of about twelve goats  kids and all  and in two years more i had three and forty  besides several that i took and killed for my food",-0.1,-1,-3,1
"1210","after that  i enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in  with little pens to drive them to take them as i wanted  and gates out of one piece of ground into another",0,0,0,0
"1211","but this was not all  for now i not only had goat s flesh to feed on when i pleased  but milk too a thing which  indeed  in the beginning  i did not so much as think of  and which  when it came into my thoughts  was really an agreeable surprise  for now i set up my dairy  and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day",2.1,2,5,3
"1212","and as nature  who gives supplies of food to every creature  dictates even naturally how to make use of it  so i  that had never milked a cow  much less a goat  or seen butter or cheese made only when i was a boy  after a great many essays and miscarriages  made both butter and cheese at last  also salt  though i found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea   and never wanted it afterwards",1.3,1,3,3
"1213","how mercifully can our creator treat his creatures  even in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction",-0.05,-1,-3,-2
"1214","how can he sweeten the bitterest providences  and give us because to praise him for dungeons and prisons",0.55,1,1,1
"1215","what a table was here spread for me in the wilderness  where i saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger",-1.1,-1,-2,-1
"1216","it would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit down to dinner",1.35,1,2,2
"1217","there was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole island  i had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command  i could hang  draw  give liberty  and take it away  and no rebels among all my subjects",1.1,1,-3,4
"1218","then  to see how like a king i dined  too  all alone  attended by my servants",2.77555756156289e-17,1,0,1
"1219","poll  as if he had been my favourite  was the only person permitted to talk to me",0.4,0,2,1
"1220","my dog  who was now grown old and crazy  and had found no species to multiply his kind upon  sat always at my right hand  and two cats  one on one side of the table and one on the other  expecting now and then a bit from my hand  as a mark of especial favour",1.15,1,1,1
"1221","but these were not the two cats which i brought on shore at first  for they were both of them dead  and had been interred near my habitation by my own hand  but one of them having multiplied by i know not what kind of creature  these were two which i had preserved tame  whereas the rest ran wild in the woods  and became indeed troublesome to me at last  for they would often come into my house  and plunder me too  till at last i was obliged to shoot them  and did kill a great many  at length they left me",-2.75,-4,-2,-4
"1222","with this attendance and in this plentiful manner i lived  neither could i be said to want anything but society  and of that  some time after this  i was likely to have too much",0.9,1,1,1
"1223","i was something impatient  as i have observed  to have the use of my boat  though very loath to run any more hazards  and therefore sometimes i sat contriving ways to get her about the island  and at other times i sat myself down contented enough without her",-2.3,-1,-2,-2
"1224","but i had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where  as i have said in my last ramble  i went up the hill to see how the shore lay  and how the current set  that i might see what i had to do  this inclination increased upon me every day  and at length i resolved to travel thither by land  following the edge of the shore",0.1,-2,2,0
"1225","i did so  but had any one in england met such a man as i was  it must either have frightened him  or raised a great deal of laughter  and as i frequently stood still to look at myself  i could not but smile at the notion of my travelling through yorkshire with such an equipage  and in such a dress",1.8,2,3,3
"1226","be pleased to take a sketch of my figure  as follows",0.75,1,3,1
"1227","i had a great high shapeless cap  made of a goat s skin  with a flap hanging down behind  as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my neck  nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes",0.65,1,2,-3
"1228","i had a short jacket of goat s skin  the skirts coming down to about the middle of the thighs  and a pair of open kneed breeches of the same  the breeches were made of the skin of an old he goat  whose hair hung down such a length on either side that  like pantaloons  it reached to the middle of my legs  stockings and shoes i had none  but had made me a pair of something is  i scarce knew what to call them  like buskins  to flap over my legs  and lace on either side like spatterdashes  but of a most barbarous shape  as indeed were all the rest of my clothes",-1,-2,1,0
"1229","i had on a broad belt of goat s skin dried  which i drew together with two thongs of the same instead of buckles  and in a kind of a frog on either side of this  instead of a sword and dagger  hung a little saw and a hatchet  one on one side and one on the other",-0.3,-1,2,-1
"1230","i had another belt not so broad  and fastened in the same manner  which hung over my shoulder  and at the end of it  under my left arm  hung two pouches  both made of goat s skin too  in one of which hung my powder  in the other my shot",-0.4,-1,0,-1
"1231","at my back i carried my basket  and on my shoulder my gun  and over my head a great clumsy  ugly  goat s skin umbrella  but which  after all  was the most necessary thing i had about me next to my gun",-1.5,-1,-1,-2
"1232","as for my face  the colour of it was really not so mulatto like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it  and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox",1.15,1,4,2
"1233","my beard i had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long  but as i had both scissors and razors sufficient  i had cut it pretty short  except what grew on my upper lip  which i had trimmed into a large pair of mahometan whiskers  such as i had seen worn by some turks at sallee  for the moors did not wear such  though the turks did  of these moustachios  or whiskers  i will not say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them  but they were of a length and shape monstrous enough  and such as in england would have passed for frightful",-0.55,-2,-3,0
"1234","but all this is by the bye  for as to my figure  i had so few to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence  so i say no more of that",0,0,-1,0
"1235","in this kind of dress i went my new journey  and was out five or six days",1.7,0,2,2
"1236","i travelled first along the sea shore  directly to the place where i first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks  and having no boat now to take care of  i went over the land a nearer way to the same height that i was upon before  when  looking forward to the points of the rocks which lay out  and which i was obliged to double with my boat  as is said above  i was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet no rippling  no motion  no current  any more there than in other places",2.45,2,1,5
"1237","i was at a strange loss to understand this  and resolved to spend some time in the observing it  to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it  but i was presently convinced how it was viz  that the tide of ebb setting from the west  and joining with the current of waters from some great river on the shore  must be the occasion of this current  and that  according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north  this current came nearer or went farther from the shore  for  waiting thereabouts till evening  i went up to the rock again  and then the tide of ebb being made  i plainly saw the current again as before  only that it ran farther off  being near half a league from the shore  whereas in my case it set close upon the shore  and hurried me and my canoe along with it  which at another time it would not have done",-0.35,-1,2,-2
"1238","this observation convinced me that i had nothing to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide  and i might very easily bring my boat about the island again  but when i began to think of putting it in practice  i had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger i had been in  that i could not think of it again with any patience  but  on the contrary  i took up another resolution  which was more safe  though more laborious and this was  that i would build  or rather make  me another periagua or canoe  and so have one for one side of the island  and one for the other",-0.55,0,-1,1
"1239","you are to understand that now i had  as i may call it  two plantations in the island one my little fortification or tent  with the wall about it  under the rock  with the cave behind me  which by this time i had enlarged into several apartments or caves  one within another",0,-1,0,1
"1240","one of these  which was the driest and largest  and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification that is to say  beyond where my wall joined to the rock was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which i have given an account  and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets  which would hold five or six bushels each  where i laid up my stores of provisions  especially my corn  some in the ear  cut off short from the straw  and the other rubbed out with my hand",0.85,1,2,2
"1241","as for my wall  made  as before  with long stakes or piles  those piles grew all like trees  and were by this time grown so big  and spread so very much  that there was not the least appearance  to any one s view  of any habitation behind them",0.75,1,3,-1
"1242","near this dwelling of mine  but a little farther within the land  and upon lower ground  lay my two pieces of corn land  which i kept duly cultivated and sowed  and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season  and whenever i had occasion for more corn  i had more land adjoining as fit as that",1.6,0,1,2
"1243","besides this  i had my country seat  and i had now a tolerable plantation there also  for  first  i had my little bower  as i called it  which i kept in repair that is to say  i kept the hedge which encircled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height  the ladder standing always in the inside",1.6,0,0,2
"1244","i kept the trees  which at first were no more than stakes  but were now grown very firm and tall  always cut  so that they might spread and grow thick and wild  and make the more agreeable shade  which they did effectually to my mind",1.05,0,0,1
"1245","in the middle of this i had my tent always standing  being a piece of a sail spread over poles  set up for that purpose  and which never wanted any repair or renewing  and under this i had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the creatures i had killed  and with other soft things  and a blanket laid on them  such as belonged to our sea bedding  which i had saved  and a great watch coat to cover me",1.4,1,2,2
"1246","and here  whenever i had occasion to be absent from my chief seat  i took up my country habitation",-0.6,0,0,-1
"1247","adjoining to this i had my enclosures for my cattle  that is to say my goats  and i had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground",-1,-2,0,0
"1248","i was so anxious to see it kept entire  lest the goats should break through  that i never left off till  with infinite labour  i had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes  and so near to one another  that it was rather a pale than a hedge  and there was scarce room to put a hand through between them  which afterwards  when those stakes grew  as they all did in the next rainy season  made the enclosure strong like a wall  indeed stronger than any wall",-0.5,-3,1,-1
"1249","this will testify for me that i was not idle  and that i spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support  for i considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would be a living magazine of flesh  milk  butter  and cheese for me as long as i lived in the place  if it were to be forty years  and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree that i might be sure of keeping them together  which by this method  indeed  i so effectually secured  that when these little stakes began to grow  i had planted them so very thick that i was forced to pull some of them up again",0.85,0,5,1
"1250","in this place also i had my grapes growing  which i principally depended on for my winter store of raisins  and which i never failed to preserve very carefully  as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet  and indeed they were not only agreeable  but medicinal  wholesome  nourishing  and refreshing to the last degree",3.7,4,6,7
"1251","as this was also about half way between my other habitation and the place where i had laid up my boat  i generally stayed and lay here in my way thither  for i used frequently to visit my boat  and i kept all things about or belonging to her in very good order",1.15,1,3,2
"1252","sometimes i went out in her to divert myself  but no more hazardous voyages would i go  scarcely ever above a stone s cast or two from the shore  i was so apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds  or any other accident",-2.15,-3,-8,-5
"1253","but now i come to a new scene of my life",0.8,0,0,0
"1254","it happened one day  about noon  going towards my boat  i was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man s naked foot on the shore  which was very plain to be seen on the sand",0.6,1,0,0
"1255","i stood like one thunderstruck  or as if i had seen an apparition",0.25,1,2,0
"1256","i listened  i looked round me  but i could hear nothing  nor see anything  i went up to a rising ground to look farther  i went up the shore and down the shore  but it was all one  i could see no other impression but that one",0.1,0,-1,2
"1257","i went to it again to see if there were any more  and to observe if it might not be my fancy  but there was no room for that  for there was exactly the print of a foot toes  heel  and every part of a foot",0.5,1,-1,0
"1258","how it came thither i knew not  nor could i in the least imagine  but after innumerable fluttering thoughts  like a man perfectly confused and out of myself  i came home to my fortification  not feeling  as we say  the ground i went on  but terrified to the last degree  looking behind me at every two or three steps  mistaking every bush and tree  and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man",-1.05,0,-1,2
"1259","nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes my affrighted imagination represented things to me in  how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy  and what strange  unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way",-0.2,-1,-1,1
"1260","when i came to my castle  for so i think i called it ever after this   i fled into it like one pursued",-0.55,1,2,0
"1261","whether i went over by the ladder  as first contrived  or went in at the hole in the rock  which i had called a door  i cannot remember  no  nor could i remember the next morning  for never frightened hare fled to cover  or fox to earth  with more terror of mind than i to this retreat",-3.3,-3,-7,-1
"1262","i slept none that night  the farther i was from the occasion of my fright  the greater my apprehensions were  which is something contrary to the nature of such things  and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in fear  but i was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing  that i formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself  even though i was now a great way off",-2.95,-4,-2,-2
"1263","sometimes i fancied it must be the devil  and reason joined in with me in this supposition  for how should any other thing in human shape come into the place",0.7,-1,0,2
"1264","where was the vessel that brought them",0,0,0,0
"1265","what marks were there of any other footstep",0,0,0,0
"1266","and how was it possible a man should come there",0,0,0,0
"1267","but then  to think that satan should take human shape upon him in such a place  where there could be no manner of occasion for it  but to leave the print of his foot behind him  and that even for no purpose too  for he could not be sure i should see it this was an amusement the other way",0.25,0,1,1
"1268","i considered that the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot  that as i lived quite on the other side of the island  he would never have been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether i should ever see it or not  and in the sand too  which the first surge of the sea  upon a high wind  would have defaced entirely",-0.55,0,-4,0
"1269","all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself and with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil",-0.8,-1,0,0
"1270","abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil  and i presently concluded then that it must be some more dangerous creature viz  that it must be some of the savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in their canoes  and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds  had made the island  and had been on shore  but were gone away again to sea  being as loath  perhaps  to have stayed in this desolate island as i would have been to have had them",-4.75,-5,-2,-5
"1271","while these reflections were rolling in my mind  i was very thankful in my thoughts that i was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time  or that they did not see my boat  by which they would have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place  and perhaps have searched farther for me",1.75,2,5,2
"1272","then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having found out my boat  and that there were people here  and that  if so  i should certainly have them come again in greater numbers and devour me  that if it should happen that they should not find me  yet they would find my enclosure  destroy all my corn  and carry away all my flock of tame goats  and i should perish at last for mere want",-1.05,-3,-2,0
"1273","thus my fear banished all my religious hope  all that former confidence in god  which was founded upon such wonderful experience as i had had of his goodness  as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve  by his power  the provision which he had made for me by his goodness",2.6,3,14,4
"1274","i reproached myself with my laziness  that would not sow any more corn one year than would just serve me till the next season  as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground  and this i thought so just a reproof  that i resolved for the future to have two or three years corn beforehand  so that  whatever might come  i might not perish for want of bread",-0.9,0,1,-2
"1275","how strange a chequer work of providence is the life of man  and by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about  as different circumstances present",0.35,1,-1,0
"1276","to day we love what to morrow we hate  to day we seek what to morrow we shun  to day we desire what to morrow we fear  nay  even tremble at the apprehensions of",-1.65,-3,-1,-3
"1277","this was exemplified in me  at this time  in the most lively manner imaginable  for i  whose only affliction was that i seemed banished from human society  that i was alone  circumscribed by the boundless ocean  cut off from mankind  and condemned to what i call silent life  that i was as one whom heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the living  or to appear among the rest of his creatures  that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life  and the greatest blessing that heaven itself  next to the supreme blessing of salvation  could bestow  i say  that i should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man  and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island",1.55,4,11,2
"1278","such is the uneven state of human life  and it afforded me a great many curious speculations afterwards  when i had a little recovered my first surprise",1,0,4,0
"1279","i considered that this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of god had determined for me  that as i could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this  so i was not to dispute his sovereignty  who  as i was his creature  had an undoubted right  by creation  to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit  and who  as i was a creature that had offended him  had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought fit  and that it was my part to submit to bear his indignation  because i had sinned against him",2.3,3,0,2
"1280","i then reflected  that as god  who was not only righteous but omnipotent  had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me  so he was able to deliver me  that if he did not think fit to do so  it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will  and  on the other hand  it was my duty also to hope in him  pray to him  and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of his daily providence",0.1,0,2,2
"1281","these thoughts took me up many hours  days  nay  i may say weeks and months  and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion i cannot omit",-0.25,-1,0,-2
"1282","one morning early  lying in my bed  and filled with thoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages  i found it discomposed me very much  upon which these words of the scripture came into my thoughts  call upon me in the day of trouble  and i will deliver thee  and thou shalt glorify me",-1.65,-3,-4,-1
"1283","upon this  rising cheerfully out of my bed  my heart was not only comforted  but i was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to god for deliverance  when i had done praying i took up my bible  and opening it to read  the first words that presented to me were  wait on the lord  and be of good cheer  and he shall strengthen thy heart  wait  i say  on the lord",4.65,3,14,6
"1284","it is impossible to express the comfort this gave me",0.25,0,2,0
"1285","in answer  i thankfully laid down the book  and was no more sad  at least on that occasion",-0.5,-1,-3,0
"1286","in the middle of these cogitations  apprehensions  and reflections  it came into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of my own  and that this foot might be the print of my own foot  when i came on shore from my boat  this cheered me up a little  too  and i began to persuade myself it was all a delusion  that it was nothing else but my own foot  and why might i not come that way from the boat  as well as i was going that way to the boat",0.1,-1,2,-1
"1287","again  i considered also that i could by no means tell for certain where i had trod  and where i had not  and that if  at last  this was only the print of my own foot  i had played the part of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions  and then are frightened at them more than anybody",-0.45,0,-4,-1
"1288","now i began to take courage  and to peep abroad again  for i had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights  so that i began to starve for provisions  for i had little or nothing within doors but some barley cakes and water  then i knew that my goats wanted to be milked too  which usually was my evening diversion  and the poor creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it  and  indeed  it almost spoiled some of them  and almost dried up their milk",-1.85,-3,-4,1
"1289","encouraging myself  therefore  with the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet  and that i might be truly said to start at my own shadow  i began to go abroad again  and went to my country house to milk my flock  but to see with what fear i went forward  how often i looked behind me  how i was ready every now and then to lay down my basket and run for my life  it would have made any one have thought i was haunted with an evil conscience  or that i had been lately most terribly frightened  and so  indeed  i had",-0.85,-1,-10,-2
"1290","however  i went down thus two or three days  and having seen nothing  i began to be a little bolder  and to think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination  but i could not persuade myself fully of this till i should go down to the shore again  and see this print of a foot  and measure it by my own  and see if there was any similitude or fitness  that i might be assured it was my own foot  but when i came to the place  first  it appeared evidently to me  that when i laid up my boat i could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts  secondly  when i came to measure the mark with my own foot  i found my foot not so large by a great deal",3.15,1,4,4
"1291","both these things filled my head with new imaginations  and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree  so that i shook with cold like one in an ague  and i went home again  filled with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there  or  in short  that the island was inhabited  and i might be surprised before i was aware  and what course to take for my security i knew not",0.8,0,2,0
"1292","oh  what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear",-2.1,-2,-5,-3
"1293","it deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their relief",1.1,1,0,2
"1294","the first thing i proposed to myself was  to throw down my enclosures  and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods  lest the enemy should find them  and then frequent the island in prospect of the same or the like booty  then the simple thing of digging up my two corn fields  lest they should find such a grain there  and still be prompted to frequent the island  then to demolish my bower and tent  that they might not see any vestiges of habitation  and be prompted to look farther  in order to find out the persons inhabiting",-1.15,-3,1,-2
"1295","these were the subject of the first night s cogitations after i was come home again  while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me  and my head was full of vapours",-1,-1,1,0
"1296","thus  fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself  when apparent to the eyes  and we find the burden of anxiety greater  by much  than the evil which we are anxious about  and what was worse than all this  i had not that relief in this trouble that from the resignation i used to practise i hoped to have",-6.5,-8,-15,-4
"1297","i looked  i thought  like saul  who complained not only that the philistines were upon him  but that god had forsaken him  for i did not now take due ways to compose my mind  by crying to god in my distress  and resting upon his providence  as i had done before  for my defence and deliverance  which  if i had done  i had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise  and perhaps carried through it with more resolution",2.15,0,3,1
"1298","this confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night  but in the morning i fell asleep  and having  by the amusement of my mind  been as it were tired  and my spirits exhausted  i slept very soundly  and waked much better composed than i had ever been before",0.1,-2,1,-1
"1299","and now i began to think sedately  and  upon debate with myself  i concluded that this island  which was so exceedingly pleasant  fruitful  and no farther from the mainland than as i had seen  was not so entirely abandoned as i might imagine  that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot  yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore  who  either with design  or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds  might come to this place  that i had lived there fifteen years now and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet  and that  if at any time they should be driven here  it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they could  seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion  that the most i could suggest any danger from was from any casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main  who  as it was likely  if they were driven hither  were here against their wills  so they made no stay here  but went off again with all possible speed  seldom staying one night on shore  lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again  and that  therefore  i had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat  in case i should see any savages land upon the spot",-0.35,0,-1,1
"1300","now  i began sorely to repent that i had dug my cave so large as to bring a door through again  which door  as i said  came out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock  upon maturely considering this  therefore  i resolved to draw me a second fortification  in the manner of a semicircle  at a distance from my wall  just where i had planted a double row of trees about twelve years before  of which i made mention  these trees having been planted so thick before  they wanted but few piles to be driven between them  that they might be thicker and stronger  and my wall would be soon finished",1.8,-1,4,0
"1301","so that i had now a double wall  and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber  old cables  and everything i could think of  to make it strong  having in it seven little holes  about as big as i might put my arm out at",0.75,1,3,0
"1302","in the inside of this i thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with continually bringing earth out of my cave  and laying it at the foot of the wall  and walking upon it  and through the seven holes i contrived to plant the muskets  of which i took notice that i had got seven on shore out of the ship  these i planted like my cannon  and fitted them into frames  that held them like a carriage  so that i could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time  this wall i was many a weary month in finishing  and yet never thought myself safe till it was done",0,-1,-1,-1
"1303","when this was done i stuck all the ground without my wall  for a great length every way  as full with stakes or sticks of the osier like wood  which i found so apt to grow  as they could well stand  insomuch that i believe i might set in near twenty thousand of them  leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall  that i might have room to see an enemy  and they might have no shelter from the young trees  if they attempted to approach my outer wall",4,2,1,6
"1304","thus in two years time i had a thick grove  and in five or six years time i had a wood before my dwelling  growing so monstrously thick and strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable  and no men  of what kind soever  could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it  much less a habitation",0.7,1,7,0
"1305","as for the way which i proposed to myself to go in and out  for i left no avenue   it was by setting two ladders  one to a part of the rock which was low  and then broke in  and left room to place another ladder upon that  so when the two ladders were taken down no man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief  and if they had come down  they were still on the outside of my outer wall",-1.5,-2,-3,-1
"1306","thus i took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own preservation  and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether without just reason  though i foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me",0.35,0,0,1
"1307","while this was doing  i was not altogether careless of my other affairs  for i had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats  they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion  and began to be sufficient for me  without the expense of powder and shot  but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones  and i was loath to lose the advantage of them  and to have them all to nurse up over again",-0.95,-2,1,-3
"1308","for this purpose  after long consideration  i could think of but two ways to preserve them  one was  to find another convenient place to dig a cave underground  and to drive them into it every night  and the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land  remote from one another  and as much concealed as i could  where i might keep about half a dozen young goats in each place  so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general  i might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time  and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour  i thought was the most rational design",1.7,0,-1,6
"1309","accordingly  i spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the island  and i pitched upon one  which was as private  indeed  as my heart could wish  it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods  where  as is observed  i almost lost myself once before  endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the island",-0.45,-2,-3,-3
"1310","here i found a clear piece of land  near three acres  so surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature  at least  it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other piece of ground i had worked so hard at",1.1,1,1,2
"1311","i immediately went to work with this piece of ground  and in less than a month s time i had so fenced it round that my flock  or herd  call it which you please  which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be  were well enough secured in it  so  without any further delay  i removed ten young she goats and two he goats to this piece  and when they were there i continued to perfect the fence till i had made it as secure as the other  which  however  i did at more leisure  and it took me up more time by a great deal",4.8,4,10,2
"1312","all this labour i was at the expense of  purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a man s foot  for as yet i had never seen any human creature come near the island  and i had now lived two years under this uneasiness  which  indeed  made my life much less comfortable than it was before  as may be well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man",-1.6,-2,0,-2
"1313","and this i must observe  with grief  too  that the discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part of my thoughts  for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits  that i seldom found myself in a due temper for application to my maker  at least  not with the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which i was will not to do  i rather prayed to god as under great affliction and pressure of mind  surrounded with danger  and in expectation every night of being murdered and devoured before morning  and i must testify  from my experience  that a temper of peace  thankfulness  love  and affection  is much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure  and that under the dread of mischief impending  a man is no more fit for a comforting performance of the duty of praying to god than he is for a repentance on a sick bed  for these discomposures affect the mind  as the others do the body  and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body  and much greater  praying to god being properly an act of the mind  not of the body",-2.95,-4,2,-1
"1314","but to go on",0,0,0,0
"1315","after i had thus secured one part of my little living stock  i went about the whole island  searching for another private place to make such another deposit  when  wandering more to the west point of the island than i had ever done yet  and looking out to sea  i thought i saw a boat upon the sea  at a great distance",1.3,1,5,1
"1316","i had found a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen s chests  which i saved out of our ship  but i had it not about me  and this was so remote that i could not tell what to make of it  though i looked at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer  whether it was a boat or not i do not know  but as i descended from the hill i could see no more of it  so i gave it over  only i resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my pocket",2,0,3,1
"1317","when i was come down the hill to the end of the island  where  indeed  i had never been before  i was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man s foot was not such a strange thing in the island as i imagined  and but that it was a special providence that i was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came  i should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main  when they happened to be a little too far out at sea  to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour  likewise  as they often met and fought in their canoes  the victors  having taken any prisoners  would bring them over to this shore  where  according to their dreadful customs  being all cannibals  they would kill and eat them  of which hereafter",-1.3,-3,-6,1
"1318","when i was come down the hill to the shore  as i said above  being the sw",0,0,0,0
"1319","point of the island  i was perfectly confounded and amazed  nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls  hands  feet  and other bones of human bodies  and particularly i observed a place where there had been a fire made  and a circle dug in the earth  like a cockpit  where i supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their fellow creatures",-0.75,1,5,-2
"1320","i was so astonished with the sight of these things  that i entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while  all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman  hellish brutality  and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature  which  though i had heard of it often  yet i never had so near a view of before  in short  i turned away my face from the horrid spectacle  my stomach grew sick  and i was just at the point of fainting  when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach  and having vomited with uncommon violence  i was a little relieved  but could not bear to stay in the place a moment  so i got up the hill again with all the speed i could  and walked on towards my own habitation",-7.7,-7,-16,-11
"1321","when i came a little out of that part of the island i stood still awhile  as amazed  and then  recovering myself  i looked up with the utmost affection of my soul  and  with a flood of tears in my eyes  gave god thanks  that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where i was distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these  and that  though i had esteemed my present condition very miserable  had yet given me so many comforts in it that i had still more to give thanks for than to complain of  and this  above all  that i had  even in this miserable condition  been comforted with the knowledge of himself  and the hope of his blessing  which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which i had suffered  or could suffer",2.7,0,3,2
"1322","in this frame of thankfulness i went home to my castle  and began to be much easier now  as to the safety of my circumstances  than ever i was before  for i observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what they could get  perhaps not seeking  not wanting  or not expecting anything here  and having often  no doubt  been up the covered  woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose",0.85,0,-1,-2
"1323","i knew i had been here now almost eighteen years  and never saw the least footsteps of human creature there before  and i might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as i was now  if i did not discover myself to them  which i had no manner of occasion to do  it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where i was  unless i found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to",0.65,1,1,-1
"1324","yet i entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that i have been speaking of  and of the wretched  inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another up  that i continued pensive and sad  and kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this  when i say my own circle  i mean by it my three plantations viz  my castle  my country seat  which i called my bower   and my enclosure in the woods  nor did i look after this for any other use than an enclosure for my goats  for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such  that i was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself",-5.15,-7,-9,-6
"1325","i did not so much as go to look after my boat all this time  but began rather to think of making another  for i could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me  lest i should meet with some of these creatures at sea  in which case  if i had happened to have fallen into their hands  i knew what would have been my lot",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"1326","time  however  and the satisfaction i had that i was in no danger of being discovered by these people  began to wear off my uneasiness about them  and i began to live just in the same composed manner as before  only with this difference  that i used more caution  and kept my eyes more about me than i did before  lest i should happen to be seen by any of them  and particularly  i was more cautious of firing my gun  lest any of them  being on the island  should happen to hear it",-1.8,-2,-7,-3
"1327","it was  therefore  a very good providence to me that i had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats  and that i had no need to hunt any more about the woods  or shoot at them  and if i did catch any of them after this  it was by traps and snares  as i had done before  so that for two years after this i believe i never fired my gun once off  though i never went out without it  and what was more  as i had saved three pistols out of the ship  i always carried them out with me  or at least two of them  sticking them in my goat skin belt",0.15,2,-1,-3
"1328","i also furbished up one of the great cutlasses that i had out of the ship  and made me a belt to hang it on also  so that i was now a most formidable fellow to look at when i went abroad  if you add to the former description of myself the particular of two pistols  and a broadsword hanging at my side in a belt  but without a scabbard",-0.2,1,3,-1
"1329","things going on thus  as i have said  for some time  i seemed  excepting these cautions  to be reduced to my former calm  sedate way of living",0.75,1,2,1
"1330","all these things tended to show me more and more how far my condition was from being miserable  compared to some others  nay  to many other particulars of life which it might have pleased god to have made my lot",-0.25,0,1,0
"1331","it put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their condition with those that were worse  in order to be thankful  than be always comparing them with those which are better  to assist their murmurings and complainings",2.25,1,1,1
"1332","as in my present condition there were not really many things which i wanted  so indeed i thought that the frights i had been in about these savage wretches  and the concern i had been in for my own preservation  had taken off the edge of my invention  for my own conveniences  and i had dropped a good design  which i had once bent my thoughts upon  and that was to try if i could not make some of my barley into malt  and then try to brew myself some beer",-0.5,-2,2,2
"1333","this was really a whimsical thought  and i reproved myself often for the simplicity of it  for i presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that it would be impossible for me to supply  as  first  casks to preserve it in  which was a thing that  as i have observed already  i could never compass  no  though i spent not only many days  but weeks  nay months  in attempting it  but to no purpose",0.25,-1,2,0
"1334","in the next place  i had no hops to make it keep  no yeast to make it work  no copper or kettle to make it boil  and yet with all these things wanting  i verily believe  had not the frights and terrors i was in about the savages intervened  i had undertaken it  and perhaps brought it to pass too  for i seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it  when once i had it in my head to began it",0.05,-1,-1,-1
"1335","but my invention now ran quite another way  for night and day i could think of nothing but how i might destroy some of the monsters in their cruel  bloody entertainment  and if possible save the victim they should bring hither to destroy",-1.7,-3,-10,-1
"1336","it would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances i hatched  or rather brooded upon  in my thoughts  for the destroying these creatures  or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any more  but all this was abortive  nothing could be possible to take effect  unless i was to be there to do it myself  and what could one man do among them  when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together with their darts  or their bows and arrows  with which they could shoot as true to a mark as i could with my gun",-3,0,-7,-2
"1337","sometimes i thought of digging a hole under the place where they made their fire  and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder  which  when they kindled their fire  would consequently take fire  and blow up all that was near it  but as  in the first place  i should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon them  my store being now within the quantity of one barrel  so neither could i be sure of its going off at any certain time  when it might surprise them  and  at best  that it would do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them  but not sufficient to make them forsake the place  so i laid it aside  and then proposed that i would place myself in ambush in some convenient place  with my three guns all double loaded  and in the middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them  when i should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot  and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my sword  i made no doubt but that  if there were twenty  i should kill them all",-4.2,-8,-10,-6
"1338","this fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks  and i was so full of it that i often dreamed of it  and  sometimes  that i was just going to let fly at them in my sleep",1.25,2,3,3
"1339","i went so far with it in my imagination that i employed myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade  as i said  to watch for them  and i went frequently to the place itself  which was now grown more familiar to me  but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword  as i may call it  the horror i had at the place  and at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another  abetted my malice",-3.35,-3,-7,-2
"1340","well  at length i found a place in the side of the hill where i was satisfied i might securely wait till i saw any of their boats coming  and might then  even before they would be ready to come on shore  convey myself unseen into some thickets of trees  in one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely  and there i might sit and observe all their bloody doings  and take my full aim at their heads  when they were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that i should miss my shot  or that i could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot",1.11022302462516e-16,0,-6,-3
"1341","in this place  then  i resolved to fulfil my design  and accordingly i prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling piece",1.35,0,3,1
"1342","the two muskets i loaded with a brace of slugs each  and four or five smaller bullets  about the size of pistol bullets  and the fowling piece i loaded with near a handful of swan shot of the largest size  i also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each  and  in this posture  well provided with ammunition for a second and third charge  i prepared myself for my expedition",1.1,1,1,0
"1343","after i had thus laid the scheme of my design  and in my imagination put it in practice  i continually made my tour every morning to the top of the hill  which was from my castle  as i called it  about three miles or more  to see if i could observe any boats upon the sea  coming near the island  or standing over towards it  but i began to tire of this hard duty  after i had for two or three months constantly kept my watch  but came always back without any discovery  there having not  in all that time  been the least appearance  not only on or near the shore  but on the whole ocean  so far as my eye or glass could reach every way",0.65,0,2,4
"1344","as long as i kept my daily tour to the hill  to look out  so long also i kept up the vigour of my design  and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages  for an offence which i had not at all entered into any discussion of in my thoughts  any farther than my passions were at first fired by the horror i conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that country  who  it seems  had been suffered by providence  in his wise disposition of the world  to have no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions  and consequently were left  and perhaps had been so for some ages  to act such horrid things  and receive such dreadful customs  as nothing but nature  entirely abandoned by heaven  and actuated by some hellish degeneracy  could have run them into",-6.6,-5,-19,-5
"1345","but now  when  as i have said  i began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which i had made so long and so far every morning in vain  so my opinion of the action itself began to alter  and i began  with cooler and calmer thoughts  to consider what i was going to engage in  what authority or call i had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals  whom heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on  and to be as it were the executioners of his judgments one upon another  how far these people were offenders against me  and what right i had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they she would promiscuously upon one another",-3.2,-4,-5,-4
"1346","i debated this very often with myself thus  how do i know what god himself judges in this particular case",0,0,1,0
"1347","it is certain these people do not commit this as a crime  it is not against their own consciences reproving  or their light reproaching them  they do not know it to be an offence  and then commit it in defiance of divine justice  as we do in almost all the sins we commit",0.5,-2,-3,-1
"1348","they think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war than we do to kill an ox  or to eat human flesh than we do to eat mutton",-1.9,-2,-9,-3
"1349","when i considered this a little  it followed necessarily that i was certainly in the wrong  that these people were not murderers  in the sense that i had before condemned them in my thoughts  any more than those christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle  or more frequently  upon many occasions  put whole troops of men to the sword  without giving quarter  though they threw down their arms and submitted",-3.05,-3,-9,-1
"1350","in the next place  it occurred to me that although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman  yet it was really nothing to me  these people had done me no injury  that if they attempted  or i saw it necessary  for my immediate preservation  to fall upon them  something might be said for it  but that i was yet out of their power  and they really had no knowledge of me  and consequently no design upon me  and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them  that this would justify the conduct of the spaniards in all their barbarities practised in america  where they destroyed millions of these people  who  however they were idolators and barbarians  and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs  such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols  were yet  as to the spaniards  very innocent people  and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the spaniards themselves at this time  and by all other christian nations of europe  as a mere butchery  a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty  unjustifiable either to god or man  and for which the very name of a spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible  to all people of humanity or of christian compassion  as if the kingdom of spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who were without principles of tenderness  or the common bowels of pity to the miserable  which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the mind",-6.85,-13,-17,-3
"1351","these considerations really put me to a pause  and to a kind of a full stop  and i began by little and little to be off my design  and to conclude i had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages  and that it was not my business to meddle with them  unless they first attacked me  and this it was my business  if possible  to prevent  but that  if i were discovered and attacked by them  i knew my duty",-3.35,-4,-2,-1
"1352","on the other hand  i argued with myself that this really was the way not to deliver myself  but entirely to ruin and destroy myself  for unless i was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time  but that should ever come on shore afterwards  if but one of them escaped to tell their country people what had happened  they would come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows  and i should only bring upon myself a certain destruction  which  at present  i had no manner of occasion for",-3.45,-6,-15,-4
"1353","upon the whole  i concluded that i ought  neither in principle nor in policy  one way or other  to concern myself in this affair  that my business was  by all possible means to conceal myself from them  and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the island i mean of human shape",-1.45,-1,-1,-1
"1354","religion joined in with this prudential resolution  and i was convinced now  many ways  that i was perfectly out of my duty when i was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures i mean innocent as to me",1,-1,0,0
"1355","as to the crimes they were guilty of towards one another  i had nothing to do with them  they were national  and i ought to leave them to the justice of god  who is the governor of nations  and knows how  by national punishments  to make a just retribution for national offences  and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public manner  by such ways as best please him",-0.25,-1,-4,-1
"1356","this appeared so clear to me now  that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that i had not been suffered to do a thing which i now saw so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if i had committed it  and i gave most humble thanks on my knees to god  that he had thus delivered me from blood guiltiness  beseeching him to grant me the protection of his providence  that i might not fall into the hands of the barbarians  or that i might not lay my hands upon them  unless i had a more clear call from heaven to do it  in defence of my own life",3.25,1,5,2
"1357","in this disposition i continued for near a year after this  and so far was i from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches  that in all that time i never once went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight  or to know whether any of them had been on shore there or not  that i might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them  or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself to fall upon them  only this i did  i went and removed my boat  which i had on the other side of the island  and carried it down to the east end of the whole island  where i ran it into a little cove  which i found under some high rocks  and where i knew  by reason of the currents  the savages durst not  at least would not  come with their boats upon any account whatever",0.1,-1,0,4
"1358","with my boat i carried away everything that i had left there belonging to her  though not necessary for the bare going thither viz  a mast and sail which i had made for her  and a thing like an anchor  but which  indeed  could not be called either anchor or grapnel  however  it was the best i could make of its kind  all these i removed  that there might not be the least shadow for discovery  or appearance of any boat  or of any human habitation upon the island",2.1,2,7,3
"1359","besides this  i kept myself  as i said  more retired than ever  and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment  to milk my she goats  and manage my little flock in the wood  which  as it was quite on the other part of the island  was out of danger  for certain  it is that these savage people  who sometimes haunted this island  never came with any thoughts of finding anything here  and consequently never wandered off from the coast  and i doubt not but they might have been several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious  as well as before",-1.15,-3,-5,0
"1360","indeed  i looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been if i had chopped upon them and been discovered before that  when  naked and unarmed  except with one gun  and that loaded often only with small shot  i walked everywhere  peeping and peering about the island  to see what i could get  what a surprise should i have been in if  when i discovered the print of a man s foot  i had  instead of that  seen fifteen or twenty savages  and found them pursuing me  and by the swiftness of their running no possibility of my escaping them",-1.4,0,-3,-2
"1361","the thoughts of this sometimes sank my very soul within me  and distressed my mind so much that i could not soon recover it  to think what i should have done  and how i should not only have been unable to resist them  but even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what i might have done  much less what now  after so much consideration and preparation  i might be able to do",-0.95,0,-4,-2
"1362","indeed  after serious thinking of these things  i would be melancholy  and sometimes it would last a great while  but i resolved it all at last into thankfulness to that providence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangers  and had kept me from those mischiefs which i could have no way been the agent in delivering myself from  because i had not the least notion of any such thing depending  or the least supposition of its being possible",-0.1,1,1,0
"1363","this renewed a contemplation which often had come into my thoughts in former times  when first i began to see the merciful dispositions of heaven  in the dangers we run through in this life  how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it  how  when we are in a quandary as we call it  a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that way  a secret hint shall direct us this way  when we intended to go that way  nay  when sense  our own inclination  and perhaps business has called us to go the other way  yet a strange impression upon the mind  from we know not what springs  and by we know not what power  shall overrule us to go this way  and it shall afterwards appear that had we gone that way  which we should have gone  and even to our imagination ought to have gone  we should have been ruined and lost",-1.1,-1,-1,0
"1364","upon these and many like reflections i afterwards made it a certain rule with me  that whenever i found those secret hints or pressings of mind to doing or not doing anything that presented  or going this way or that way  i never failed to obey the secret dictate  though i knew no other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon my mind",1.5,-1,-1,1
"1365","i could give many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my life  but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island  besides many occasions which it is very likely i might have taken notice of  if i had seen with the same eyes then that i see with now",0,0,0,0
"1366","but it is never too late to be wise  and i cannot but advise all considering men  whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine  or even though not so extraordinary  not to slight such secret intimations of providence  let them come from what invisible intelligence they will",2.9,3,0,3
"1367","that i shall not discuss  and perhaps cannot account for  but certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits  and a secret communication between those embodied and those unembodied  and such a proof as can never be withstood  of which i shall have occasion to give some remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place",0.25,0,0,1
"1368","i believe the reader of this will not think it strange if i confess that these anxieties  these constant dangers i lived in  and the concern that was now upon me  put an end to all invention  and to all the contrivances that i had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences",-2.6,-4,-1,2
"1369","i had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food",2.2,0,3,1
"1370","i cared not to drive a nail  or chop a stick of wood now  for fear the noise i might make should be heard  much less would i fire a gun for the same reason  and above all i was intolerably uneasy at making any fire  lest the smoke  which is visible at a great distance in the day  should betray me",-3.65,-4,-7,-5
"1371","for this reason  i removed that part of my business which required fire  such as burning of pots and pipes   c",-0.05,-1,-2,1
"1372","into my new apartment in the woods  where  after i had been some time  i found  to my unspeakable consolation  a mere natural cave in the earth  which went in a vast way  and where  i daresay  no savage  had he been at the mouth of it  would be so hardy as to venture in  nor  indeed  would any man else  but one who  like me  wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat",1.75,-1,4,1
"1373","the mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock  where  by mere accident  i would say  if i did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to providence   i was cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal  and before i go on i must observe the reason of my making this charcoal  which was this i was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation  as i said before  and yet i could not live there without baking my bread  cooking my meat   c",0.2,0,-3,-2
"1374","so i contrived to burn some wood here  as i had seen done in england  under turf  till it became chark or dry coal  and then putting the fire out  i preserved the coal to carry home  and perform the other services for which fire was wanting  without danger of smoke",-1.9,-4,-4,-2
"1375","but this is by the bye",0,0,0,0
"1376","while i was cutting down some wood here  i perceived that  behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or underwood  there was a kind of hollow place  i was curious to look in it  and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it  i found it was pretty large  that is to say  sufficient for me to stand upright in it  and perhaps another with me  but i must confess to you that i made more haste out than i did in  when looking farther into the place  and which was perfectly dark  i saw two broad shining eyes of some creature  whether devil or man i knew not  which twinkled like two stars  the dim light from the cave s mouth shining directly in  and making the reflection",2,-4,7,0
"1377","however  after some pause i recovered myself  and began to call myself a thousand fools  and to think that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone  and that i might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself",-1.65,-3,-5,-3
"1378","upon this  plucking up my courage  i took up a firebrand  and in i rushed again  with the stick flaming in my hand  i had not gone three steps in before i was almost as frightened as before  for i heard a very loud sigh  like that of a man in some pain  and it was followed by a broken noise  as of words half expressed  and then a deep sigh again",-1.4,-2,-3,-4
"1379","i stepped back  and was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat  and if i had had a hat on my head  i will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off",-0.4,-2,-1,0
"1380","but still plucking up my spirits as well as i could  and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence of god was everywhere  and was able to protect me  i stepped forward again  and by the light of the firebrand  holding it up a little over my head  i saw lying on the ground a monstrous  frightful old he goat  just making his will  as we say  and gasping for life  and  dying  indeed  of mere old age",1,-1,1,1
"1381","i stirred him a little to see if i could get him out  and he essayed to get up  but was not able to raise himself  and i thought with myself he might even lie there for if he had frightened me  so he would certainly fright any of the savages  if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him",-2,-2,-2,-2
"1382","i was now recovered from my surprise  and began to look round me  when i found the cave was but very small that is to say  it might be about twelve feet over  but in no manner of shape  neither round nor square  no hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere nature",1.2,-1,-1,2
"1383","i observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in further  but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it  and whither it went i knew not  so  having no candle  i gave it over for that time  but resolved to go again the next day provided with candles and a tinder box  which i had made of the lock of one of the muskets  with some wildfire in the pan",-0.4,-2,1,-2
"1384","accordingly  the next day i came provided with six large candles of my own making  for i made very good candles now of goat s tallow  but was hard set for candle wick  using sometimes rags or rope yarn  and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles   and going into this low place i was obliged to creep upon all fours as i have said  almost ten yards which  by the way  i thought was a venture bold enough  considering that i knew not how far it might go  nor what was beyond it",0,0,6,0
"1385","when i had got through the strait  i found the roof rose higher up  i believe near twenty feet  but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island  i daresay  as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles",0.85,0,3,1
"1386","what it was in the rock whether diamonds or any other precious stones  or gold which i rather supposed it to be i knew not",1,2,2,3
"1387","the place i was in was a most delightful cavity  or grotto  though perfectly dark  the floor was dry and level  and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon it  so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen  neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof",-1.35,-1,2,-2
"1388","the only difficulty in it was the entrance which  however  as it was a place of security  and such a retreat as i wanted  i thought was a convenience  so that i was really rejoiced at the discovery  and resolved  without any delay  to bring some of those things which i was most anxious about to this place  particularly  i resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder  and all my spare arms viz  two fowling pieces for i had three in all and three muskets for of them i had eight in all  so i kept in my castle only five  which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence  and were ready also to take out upon any expedition",1.45,-1,4,-1
"1389","upon this occasion of removing my ammunition i happened to open the barrel of powder which i took up out of the sea  and which had been wet  and i found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side  which caking and growing hard  had preserved the inside like a kernel in the she will  so that i had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask",2.4,1,5,3
"1390","this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time  so i carried all away thither  never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle  for fear of a surprise of any kind  i also carried thither all the lead i had left for bullets",1.95,1,2,4
"1391","i fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks  where none could come at them  for i persuaded myself  while i was here  that if five hundred savages were to hunt me  they could never find me out or if they did  they would not venture to attack me here",-1,-1,1,-2
"1392","the old goat whom i found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the next day after i made this discovery  and i found it much easier to dig a great hole there  and throw him in and cover him with earth  than to drag him out  so i interred him there  to prevent offence to my nose",0.45,-2,-4,2
"1393","i was now in the twenty third year of my residence in this island  and was so naturalised to the place and the manner of living  that  could i but have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me  i could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there  even to the last moment  till i had laid me down and died  like the old goat in the cave",0.9,-2,-2,3
"1394","i had also arrived to some little diversions and amusements  which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than it did before first  i had taught my poll  as i noted before  to speak  and he did it so familiarly  and talked so articulately and plain  that it was very pleasant to me  and he lived with me no less than six and twenty years",3.4,3,8,3
"1395","how long he might have lived afterwards i know not  though i know they have a notion in the brazils that they live a hundred years",0,0,0,1
"1396","my dog was a pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time  and then died of mere old age",1.75,1,1,3
"1397","as for my cats  they multiplied  as i have observed  to that degree that i was obliged to shoot several of them at first  to keep them from devouring me and all i had  but at length  when the two old ones i brought with me were gone  and after some time continually driving them from me  and letting them have no provision with me  they all ran wild into the woods  except two or three favourites  which i kept tame  and whose young  when they had any  i always drowned  and these were part of my family",-1.55,-1,-2,0
"1398","besides these i always kept two or three household kids about me  whom i taught to feed out of my hand  and i had two more parrots  which talked pretty well  and would all call robin crusoe  but none like my first  nor  indeed  did i take the pains with any of them that i had done with him",1.9,2,3,1
"1399","i had also several tame sea fowls  whose name i knew not  that i caught upon the shore  and cut their wings  and the little stakes which i had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick grove  these fowls all lived among these low trees  and bred there  which was very agreeable to me  so that  as i said above  i began to be very well contented with the life i led  if i could have been secured from the dread of the savages",1.75,2,4,2
"1400","but it was otherwise directed  and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to make this just observation from it  how frequently  in the course of our lives  the evil which in itself we seek most to shun  and which  when we are fallen into  is the most dreadful to us  is oftentimes the very means or door of our deliverance  by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen into",-4.45,-6,-10,-3
"1401","i could give many examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life  but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island",-0.05,1,2,0
"1402","it was now the month of december  as i said above  in my twenty third year  and this  being the southern solstice  for winter i cannot call it   was the particular time of my harvest  and required me to be pretty much abroad in the fields  when  going out early in the morning  even before it was thorough daylight  i was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore  at a distance from me of about two miles  toward that part of the island where i had observed some savages had been  as before  and not on the other side  but  to my great affliction  it was on my side of the island",-0.15,0,2,1
"1403","i was indeed terribly surprised at the sight  and stopped short within my grove  not daring to go out  lest i might be surprised  and yet i had no more peace within  from the apprehensions i had that if these savages  in rambling over the island  should find my corn standing or cut  or any of my works or improvements  they would immediately conclude that there were people in the place  and would then never rest till they had found me out",-0.1,1,-2,4
"1404","in this extremity i went back directly to my castle  pulled up the ladder after me  and made all things without look as wild and natural as i could",0.1,-1,1,-2
"1405","then i prepared myself within  putting myself in a posture of defence",0.5,0,1,1
"1406","i loaded all my cannon  as i called them that is to say  my muskets  which were mounted upon my new fortification and all my pistols  and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine protection  and earnestly to pray to god to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians",3.6,3,6,4
"1407","i continued in this posture about two hours  and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad  for i had no spies to send out",-0.5,0,-3,0
"1408","after sitting a while longer  and musing what i should do in this case  i was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer  so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill  where there was a flat place  as i observed before  and then pulling the ladder after me  i set it up again and mounted the top of the hill  and pulling out my perspective glass  which i had taken on purpose  i laid me down flat on my belly on the ground  and began to look for the place",-1,0,0,-1
"1409","i presently found there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made  not to warm them  for they had no need of that  the weather being extremely hot  but  as i supposed  to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them  whether alive or dead i could not tell",-2.15,-1,-6,1
"1410","they had two canoes with them  which they had hauled up upon the shore  and as it was then ebb of tide  they seemed to me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again",-0.25,0,0,-1
"1411","it is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into  especially seeing them come on my side of the island  and so near to me  but when i considered their coming must be always with the current of the ebb  i began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind  being satisfied that i might go abroad with safety all the time of the flood of tide  if they were not on shore before  and having made this observation  i went abroad about my harvest work with the more composure",3.75,2,4,2
"1412","as i expected  so it proved  for as soon as the tide made to the westward i saw them all take boat and row  or paddle as we call it  away",0,0,0,0
"1413","i should have observed  that for an hour or more before they went off they were dancing  and i could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass",0,0,0,0
"1414","i could not perceive  by my nicest observation  but that they were stark naked  and had not the least covering upon them  but whether they were men or women i could not distinguish",0.5,0,0,0
"1415","as soon as i saw them shipped and gone  i took two guns upon my shoulders  and two pistols in my girdle  and my great sword by my side without a scabbard  and with all the speed i was able to make went away to the hill where i had discovered the first appearance of all  and as soon as i got thither  which was not in less than two hours  for i could not go quickly  being so loaded with arms as i was   i perceived there had been three canoes more of the savages at that place  and looking out farther  i saw they were all at sea together  making over for the main",-0.1,0,3,2
"1416","this was a dreadful sight to me  especially as  going down to the shore  i could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it viz  the blood  the bones  and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport",-2.15,0,-5,-2
"1417","i was so filled with indignation at the sight  that i now began to premeditate the destruction of the next that i saw there  let them be whom or how many soever",-1.5,-2,-5,-2
"1418","it seemed evident to me that the visits which they made thus to this island were not very frequent  for it was above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again that is to say  i neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all that time  for as to the rainy seasons  then they are sure not to come abroad  at least not so far",0.25,0,-1,1
"1419","yet all this while i lived uncomfortably  by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise  from whence i observe  that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering  especially if there is no room to shake off that expectation or those apprehensions",-2.3,-6,-8,2
"1420","during all this time i was in a murdering humour  and spent most of my hours  which should have been better employed  in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them the very next time i should see them especially if they should be divided  as they were the last time  into two parties  nor did i consider at all that if i killed one party suppose ten or a dozen i was still the next day  or week  or month  to kill another  and so another  even  ad infinitum   till i should be  at length  no less a murderer than they were in being man eaters and perhaps much more so",-2.45,-2,-8,-4
"1421","i spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind  expecting that i should one day or other fall into the hands of these merciless creatures  and if i did at any time venture abroad  it was not without looking around me with the greatest care and caution imaginable",-0.75,-2,6,-6
"1422","and now i found  to my great comfort  how happy it was that i had provided a tame flock or herd of goats  for i durst not upon any account fire my gun  especially near that side of the island where they usually came  lest i should alarm the savages  and if they had fled from me now  i was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days  and then i knew what to expect",-0.3,1,3,2
"1423","however  i wore out a year and three months more before i ever saw any more of the savages  and then i found them again  as i shall soon observe",-0.4,-1,0,1
"1424","it is true they might have been there once or twice  but either they made no stay  or at least i did not see them  but in the month of may  as near as i could calculate  and in my four and twentieth year  i had a very strange encounter with them  of which in its place",-0.25,-1,0,1
"1425","the perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months interval was very great  i slept unquietly  dreamed always frightful dreams  and often started out of my sleep in the night",-0.75,0,4,-2
"1426","in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind  and in the night i dreamed often of killing the savages and of the reasons why i might justify doing it",-2.5,-3,-2,-2
"1427","but to waive all this for a while",0,0,0,0
"1428","it was in the middle of may  on the sixteenth day  i think  as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon  for i marked all upon the post still  i say  it was on the sixteenth of may that it blew a very great storm of wind all day  with a great deal of lightning and thunder  and  a very foul night it was after it",0.05,0,-2,0
"1429","i knew not what was the particular occasion of it  but as i was reading in the bible  and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present condition  i was surprised with the noise of a gun  as i thought  fired at sea",-0.65,-1,-3,1
"1430","this was  to be sure  a surprise quite of a different nature from any i had met with before  for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind",1.1,0,2,2
"1431","i started up in the greatest haste imaginable  and  in a trice  clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock  and pulled it after me  and mounting it the second time  got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun  which  accordingly  in about half a minute i heard  and by the sound  knew that it was from that part of the sea where i was driven down the current in my boat",-0.35,1,2,2
"1432","i immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress  and that they had some comrade  or some other ship in company  and fired these for signals of distress  and to obtain help",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"1433","i had the presence of mind at that minute to think  that though i could not help them  it might be that they might help me  so i brought together all the dry wood i could get at hand  and making a good handsome pile  i set it on fire upon the hill",1.9,2,6,2
"1434","the wood was dry  and blazed freely  and  though the wind blew very hard  yet it burned fairly out  so that i was certain  if there was any such thing as a ship  they must needs see it",1.45,-1,0,2
"1435","and no doubt they did  for as soon as ever my fire blazed up  i heard another gun  and after that several others  all from the same quarter",-1.5,-1,-5,-2
"1436","i plied my fire all night long  till daybreak  and when it was broad day  and the air cleared up  i saw something at a great distance at sea  full east of the island  whether a sail or a hull i could not distinguish no  not with my glass  the distance was so great  and the weather still something hazy also  at least  it was so out at sea",0.95,1,1,2
"1437","i looked frequently at it all that day  and soon perceived that it did not move  so i presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor  and being eager  you may be sure  to be satisfied  i took my gun in my hand  and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where i had formerly been carried away by the current  and getting up there  the weather by this time being perfectly clear  i could plainly see  to my great sorrow  the wreck of a ship  cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which i found when i was out in my boat  and which rocks  as they checked the violence of the stream  and made a kind of counter stream  or eddy  were the occasion of my recovering from the most desperate  hopeless condition that ever i had been in in all my life",-0.65,1,0,-2
"1438","thus  what is one man s safety is another man s destruction  for it seems these men  whoever they were  being out of their knowledge  and the rocks being wholly under water  had been driven upon them in the night  the wind blowing hard at ene",0.4,-2,-3,0
"1439","had they seen the island  as i must necessarily suppose they did not  they must  as i thought  have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat  but their firing off guns for help  especially when they saw  as i imagined  my fire  filled me with many thoughts",-0.0499999999999999,0,0,0
"1440","first  i imagined that upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their boat  and endeavoured to make the shore  but that the sea running very high  they might have been cast away",0,0,0,1
"1441","other times i imagined that they might have lost their boat before  as might be the case many ways  particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship  which many times obliged men to stave  or take in pieces  their boat  and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands",-1.35,-2,-3,-2
"1442","other times i imagined they had some other ship or ships in company  who  upon the signals of distress they made  had taken them up  and carried them off",-1,-1,-2,-1
"1443","other times i fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat  and being hurried away by the current that i had been formerly in  were carried out into the great ocean  where there was nothing but misery and perishing  and that  perhaps  they might by this time think of starving  and of being in a condition to eat one another",-1.4,0,-1,-2
"1444","as all these were but conjectures at best  so  in the condition i was in  i could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men  and pity them  which had still this good effect upon my side  that it gave me more and more because to give thanks to god  who had so happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition  and that of two ships companies  who were now cast away upon this part of the world  not one life should be spared but mine",1.1,0,4,2
"1445","i learned here again to observe  that it is very rare that the providence of god casts us into any condition so low  or any misery so great  but we may see something or other to be thankful for  and may see others in worse circumstances than our own",0.6,1,1,0
"1446","such certainly was the case of these men  of whom i could not so much as see room to suppose any were saved  nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there  except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company  and this was but mere possibility indeed  for i saw not the least sign or appearance of any such thing",2,0,3,0
"1447","i cannot explain  by any possible energy of words  what a strange longing i felt in my soul upon this sight  breaking out sometimes thus  oh that there had been but one or two  nay  or but one soul saved out of this ship  to have escaped to me  that i might but have had one companion  one fellow creature  to have spoken to me and to have conversed with",0.1,-3,0,0
"1448","in all the time of my solitary life i never felt so earnest  so strong a desire after the society of my fellow creatures  or so deep a regret at the want of it",1.5,1,4,1
"1449","there are some secret springs in the affections which  when they are set a going by some object in view  or  though not in view  yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination  that motion carries out the soul  by its impetuosity  to such violent  eager embracings of the object  that the absence of it is insupportable",-0.85,-3,-1,0
"1450","such were these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved",1.55,1,4,1
"1451","i believe i repeated the words  oh that it had been but one  a thousand times  and my desires were so moved by it  that when i spoke the words my hands would clinch together  and my fingers would press the palms of my hands  so that if i had had any soft thing in my hand i should have crushed it involuntarily  and the teeth in my head would strike together  and set against one another so strong  that for some time i could not part them again",-1,-1,-1,-4
"1452","let the naturalists explain these things  and the reason and manner of them",0.6,0,0,2
"1453","all i can do is to describe the fact  which was even surprising to me when i found it  though i knew not from whence it proceeded  it was doubtless the effect of ardent wishes  and of strong ideas formed in my mind  realising the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow christians would have been to me",4.3,4,6,5
"1454","but it was not to be  either their fate or mine  or both  forbade it  for  till the last year of my being on this island  i never knew whether any were saved out of that ship or no  and had only the affliction  some days after  to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next the shipwreck",-2,-2,-2,-5
"1455","he had no clothes on but a seaman s waistcoat  a pair of open kneed linen drawers  and a blue linen shirt  but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of",0,0,-1,0
"1456","he had nothing in his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe the last was to me of ten times more value than the first",-0.25,0,0,-1
"1457","it was now calm  and i had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this wreck  not doubting but i might find something on board that might be useful to me",0.5,2,4,-1
"1458","but that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board  whose life i might not only save  but might  by saving that life  comfort my own to the last degree  and this thought clung so to my heart that i could not be quiet night or day  but i must venture out in my boat on board this wreck  and committing the rest to god s providence  i thought the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted that it must come from some invisible direction  and that i should be wanting to myself if i did not go",2.6,2,6,4
"1459","under the power of this impression  i hastened back to my castle  prepared everything for my voyage  took a quantity of bread  a great pot of fresh water  a compass to steer by  a bottle of rum  for i had still a great deal of that left   and a basket of raisins  and thus  loading myself with everything necessary",1.85,2,5,3
"1460","i went down to my boat  got the water out of her  got her afloat  loaded all my cargo in her  and then went home again for more",0,0,0,0
"1461","my second cargo was a great bag of rice  the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade  another large pot of water  and about two dozen of small loaves  or barley cakes  more than before  with a bottle of goat s milk and a cheese  all which with great labour and sweat i carried to my boat  and praying to god to direct my voyage  i put out  and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore  came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north east side",1,1,5,0
"1462","and now i was to launch out into the ocean  and either to venture or not to venture",-0.1,0,0,1
"1463","i looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a distance  and which were very terrible to me from the remembrance of the hazard i had been in before  and my heart began to fail me  for i foresaw that if i was driven into either of those currents  i should be carried a great way out to sea  and perhaps out of my reach or sight of the island again  and that then  as my boat was but small  if any little gale of wind should rise  i should be inevitably lost",-2.75,-3,-3,-3
"1464","these thoughts so oppressed my mind that i began to give over my enterprise  and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore  i stepped out  and sat down upon a rising bit of ground  very pensive and anxious  between fear and desire  about my voyage  when  as i was musing  i could perceive that the tide was turned  and the flood come on  upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours",-2.95,-2,-6,-1
"1465","upon this  presently it occurred to me that i should go up to the highest piece of ground i could find  and observe  if i could  how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the flood came in  that i might judge whether  if i was driven one way out  i might not expect to be driven another way home  with the same rapidity of the currents",0.4,0,0,1
"1466","this thought was no sooner in my head than i cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways  and from whence i had a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide  and which way i was to guide myself in my return",1.85,2,-1,2
"1467","here i found  that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the island  so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side  and that i had nothing to do but to keep to the north side of the island in my return  and i should do well enough",1.15,2,0,1
"1468","encouraged by this observation  i resolved the next morning to set out with the first of the tide  and reposing myself for the night in my canoe  under the watch coat i mentioned  i launched out",1.65,0,5,0
"1469","i first made a little out to sea  full north  till i began to feel the benefit of the current  which set eastward  and which carried me at a great rate  and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before  so as to take from me all government of the boat  but having a strong steerage with my paddle  i went at a great rate directly for the wreck  and in less than two hours i came up to it",0.5,2,5,2
"1470","it was a dismal sight to look at  the ship  which by its building was spanish  stuck fast  jammed in between two rocks",-0.9,-1,-4,0
"1471","all the stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces by the sea  and as her forecastle  which stuck in the rocks  had run on with great violence  her mainmast and foremast were brought by the board that is to say  broken short off  but her bowsprit was sound  and the head and bow appeared firm",-2.75,-2,-5,-2
"1472","when i came close to her  a dog appeared upon her  who  seeing me coming  yelped and cried  and as soon as i called him  jumped into the sea to come to me  i took him into the boat  but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst",-2.85,-2,-7,2
"1473","i gave him a cake of my bread  and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow  i then gave the poor creature some fresh water  with which  if i would have let him  he would have burst himself",-1.7,1,-1,-3
"1474","after this i went on board  but the first sight i met with was two men drowned in the cook room  or forecastle of the ship  with their arms fast about one another",-0.8,1,-2,0
"1475","i concluded  as is indeed probable  that when the ship struck  it being in a storm  the sea broke so high and so continually over her  that the men were not able to bear it  and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the water  as much as if they had been under water",-2,-2,-4,0
"1476","besides the dog  there was nothing left in the ship that had life  nor any goods  that i could see  but what were spoiled by the water",0,-1,-2,1
"1477","there were some casks of liquor  whether wine or brandy i knew not  which lay lower in the hold  and which  the water being ebbed out  i could see  but they were too big to meddle with",-0.25,-1,1,-4
"1478","i saw several chests  which i believe belonged to some of the seamen  and i got two of them into the boat  without examining what was in them",0,0,0,0
"1479","had the stern of the ship been fixed  and the forepart broken off  i am persuaded i might have made a good voyage  for by what i found in those two chests i had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board  and  if i may guess from the course she steered  she must have been bound from buenos ayres  or the rio de la plata  in the south part of america  beyond the brazils to the havannah  in the gulf of mexico  and so perhaps to spain",0.85,0,8,1
"1480","she had  no doubt  a great treasure in her  but of no use  at that time  to anybody  and what became of the crew i then knew not",0.5,1,3,0
"1481","i found  besides these chests  a little cask full of liquor  of about twenty gallons  which i got into my boat with much difficulty",0.1,-1,0,0
"1482","there were several muskets in the cabin  and a great powder horn  with about four pounds of powder in it  as for the muskets  i had no occasion for them  so i left them  but took the powder horn",0.5,1,2,0
"1483","i took a fire shovel and tongs  which i wanted extremely  as also two little brass kettles  a copper pot to make chocolate  and a gridiron  and with this cargo  and the dog  i came away  the tide beginning to make home again and the same evening  about an hour within night  i reached the island again  weary and fatigued to the last degree",-1.15,-2,-5,0
"1484","i reposed that night in the boat and in the morning i resolved to harbour what i had got in my new cave  and not carry it home to my castle",1.4,-1,2,0
"1485","after refreshing myself  i got all my cargo on shore  and began to examine the particulars",0.5,1,0,1
"1486","the cask of liquor i found to be a kind of rum  but not such as we had at the brazils  and  in a word  not at all good  but when i came to open the chests  i found several things of great use to me for example  i found in one a fine case of bottles  of an extraordinary kind  and filled with cordial waters  fine and very good  the bottles held about three pints each  and were tipped with silver",3.35,4,10,3
"1487","i found two pots of very good succades  or sweetmeats  so fastened also on the top that the salt water had not hurt them  and two more of the same  which the water had spoiled",0,0,1,2
"1488","i found some very good shirts  which were very welcome to me  and about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths  the former were also very welcome  being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day",3.1,5,5,4
"1489","besides this  when i came to the till in the chest  i found there three great bags of pieces of eight  which held about eleven hundred pieces in all  and in one of them  wrapped up in a paper  six doubloons of gold  and some small bars or wedges of gold  i suppose they might all weigh near a pound",1.6,2,5,0
"1490","in the other chest were some clothes  but of little value  but  by the circumstances  it must have belonged to the gunner s mate  though there was no powder in it  except two pounds of fine glazed powder  in three flasks  kept  i suppose  for charging their fowling pieces on occasion",0.85,1,1,1
"1491","upon the whole  i got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me  for  as to the money  i had no manner of occasion for it  it was to me as the dirt under my feet  and i would have given it all for three or four pair of english shoes and stockings  which were things i greatly wanted  but had had none on my feet for many years",-0.15,-1,-3,0
"1492","i had  indeed  got two pair of shoes now  which i took off the feet of two drowned men whom i saw in the wreck  and i found two pair more in one of the chests  which were very welcome to me  but they were not like our english shoes  either for ease or service  being rather what we call pumps than shoes",0.8,2,2,1
"1493","i found in this seaman s chest about fifty pieces of eight  in rials  but no gold  i supposed this belonged to a poorer man than the other  which seemed to belong to some officer",0.6,0,-1,3
"1494","well  however  i lugged this money home to my cave  and laid it up  as i had done that before which i had brought from our own ship  but it was a great pity  as i said  that the other part of this ship had not come to my share  for i am satisfied i might have loaded my canoe several times over with money  and  thought i  if i ever escape to england  it might lie here safe enough till i come again and fetch it",2.65,2,4,3
"1495","having now brought all my things on shore and secured them  i went back to my boat  and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour  where i laid her up  and made the best of my way to my old habitation  where i found everything safe and quiet",2.9,3,6,3
"1496","i began now to repose myself  live after my old fashion  and take care of my family affairs  and for a while i lived easy enough  only that i was more vigilant than i used to be  looked out oftener  and did not go abroad so much  and if at any time i did stir with any freedom  it was always to the east part of the island  where i was pretty well satisfied the savages never came  and where i could go without so many precautions  and such a load of arms and ammunition as i always carried with me if i went the other way",5.4,6,11,5
"1497","i lived in this condition near two years more  but my unlucky head  that was always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable  was all these two years filled with projects and designs how  if it were possible  i might get away from this island  for sometimes i was for making another voyage to the wreck  though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage  sometimes for a ramble one way  sometimes another and i believe verily  if i had had the boat that i went from sallee in  i should have ventured to sea  bound anywhere  i knew not whither",-0.85,-3,-3,-1
"1498","i have been  in all my circumstances  a memento to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind  whence  for aught i know  one half of their miseries flow  i mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein god and nature hath placed them for  not to look back upon my primitive condition  and the excellent advice of my father  the opposition to which was  as i may call it  my  original sin   my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable condition  for had that providence which so happily seated me at the brazils as a planter blessed me with confined desires  and i could have been contented to have gone on gradually  i might have been by this time i mean in the time of my being in this island one of the most considerable planters in the brazils nay  i am persuaded  that by the improvements i had made in that little time i lived there  and the increase i should probably have made if i had remained  i might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores and what business had i to leave a settled fortune  a well stocked plantation  improving and increasing  to turn supercargo to guinea to fetch negroes  when patience and time would have so increased our stock at home  that we could have bought them at our own door from those whose business it was to fetch them",6.25,2,5,7
"1499","and though it had cost us something more  yet the difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard",1.55,1,4,0
"1500","but as this is usually the fate of young heads  so reflection upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years  or of the dear bought experience of time so it was with me now  and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper  that i could not satisfy myself in my station  but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from this place  and that i may  with greater pleasure to the reader  bring on the remaining part of my story  it may not be improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape  and how  and upon what foundation  i acted",-0.5,-2,1,-1
"1501","i am now to be supposed retired into my castle  after my late voyage to the wreck  my frigate laid up and secured under water  as usual  and my condition restored to what it was before  i had more wealth  indeed  than i had before  but was not at all the richer  for i had no more use for it than the indians of peru had before the spaniards came there",1.7,1,3,0
"1502","it was one of the nights in the rainy season in march  the four and twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude  i was lying in my bed or hammock  awake  very well in health  had no pain  no distemper  no uneasiness of body  nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary  but could by no means close my eyes  that is  so as to sleep  no  not a wink all night long  otherwise than as follows",-1.2,-2,-4,-2
"1503","it is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain  the memory  in this night s time",0,0,3,-1
"1504","i ran over the whole history of my life in miniature  or by abridgment  as i may call it  to my coming to this island  and also of that part of my life since i came to this island",0,0,0,0
"1505","in my reflections upon the state of my case since i came on shore on this island  i was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my habitation here  with the life of anxiety  fear  and care which i had lived in ever since i had seen the print of a foot in the sand",0,-1,1,-2
"1506","not that i did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the while  and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore there  but i had never known it  and was incapable of any apprehensions about it  my satisfaction was perfect  though my danger was the same  and i was as happy in not knowing my danger as if i had never really been exposed to it",-1.9,-2,1,1
"1507","this furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections  and particularly this one  how infinitely good that providence is  which has provided  in its government of mankind  such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things  and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers  the sight of which  if discovered to him  would distract his mind and sink his spirits  he is kept serene and calm  by having the events of things hid from his eyes  and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him",4.05,2,6,2
"1508","after these thoughts had for some time entertained me  i came to reflect seriously upon the real danger i had been in for so many years in this very island  and how i had walked about in the greatest security  and with all possible tranquillity  even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill  a great tree  or the casual approach of night  had been between me and the worst kind of destruction viz  that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages  who would have seized on me with the same view as i would on a goat or turtle  and have thought it no more crime to kill and devour me than i did of a pigeon or a curlew",-4,-5,-8,-3
"1509","i would unjustly slander myself if i should say i was not sincerely thankful to my great preserver  to whose singular protection i acknowledged  with great humanity  all these unknown deliverances were due  and without which i must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands",-0.45,-2,5,-1
"1510","when these thoughts were over  my head was for some time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures  i mean the savages  and how it came to pass in the world that the wise governor of all things should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity nay  to something so much below even brutality itself as to devour its own kind  but as this ended in some  at that time  fruitless speculations  it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in",-2.9,-4,0,-4
"1511","how far off the coast was from whence they came",0.6,0,0,1
"1512","what they ventured over so far from home for",0,0,0,0
"1513","what kind of boats they had",0.5,0,2,1
"1514","and why i might not order myself and my business so that i might be able to go over thither  as they were to come to me",0,0,0,0
"1515","i never so much as troubled myself to consider what i should do with myself when i went thither  what would become of me if i fell into the hands of these savages  or how i should escape them if they attacked me  no  nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast  and not to be attacked by some or other of them  without any possibility of delivering myself  and if i should not fall into their hands  what i should do for provision  or whither i should bend my course  none of these thoughts  i say  so much as came in my way  but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the mainland",-3.55,-5,-4,0
"1516","i looked upon my present condition as the most miserable that could possibly be  that i was not able to throw myself into anything but death  that could be called worse  and if i reached the shore of the main i might perhaps meet with relief  or i might coast along  as i did on the african shore  till i came to some inhabited country  and where i might find some relief  and after all  perhaps i might fall in with some christian ship that might take me in  and if the worst came to the worst  i could but die  which would put an end to all these miseries at once",-2.75,-6,-13,-1
"1517","pray note  all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind  an impatient temper  made desperate  as it were  by the long continuance of my troubles  and the disappointments i had met in the wreck i had been on board of  and where i had been so near obtaining what i so earnestly longed for somebody to speak to  and to learn some knowledge from them of the place where i was  and of the probable means of my deliverance",-2.05,-6,-12,1
"1518","i was agitated wholly by these thoughts  all my calm of mind  in my resignation to providence  and waiting the issue of the dispositions of heaven  seemed to be suspended  and i had as it were no power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main  which came upon me with such force  and such an impetuosity of desire  that it was not to be resisted",0.95,1,3,-1
"1519","when this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more  with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment  and my pulse beat as if i had been in a fever  merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it  nature as if i had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of it threw me into a sound sleep",-2.55,-2,-9,-4
"1520","one would have thought i should have dreamed of it  but i did not  nor of anything relating to it  but i dreamed that as i was going out in the morning as usual from my castle  i saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to land  and that they brought with them another savage whom they were going to kill in order to eat him  when  on a sudden  the savage that they were going to kill jumped away  and ran for his life  and i thought in my sleep that he came running into my little thick grove before my fortification  to hide himself  and that i seeing him alone  and not perceiving that the others sought him that way  showed myself to him  and smiling upon him  encouraged him  that he kneeled down to me  seeming to pray me to assist him  upon which i showed him my ladder  made him go up  and carried him into my cave  and he became my servant  and that as soon as i had got this man  i said to myself  now i may certainly venture to the mainland  for this fellow will serve me as a pilot  and will tell me what to do  and whither to go for provisions  and whither not to go for fear of being devoured  what places to venture into  and what to shun",-0.55,-5,-3,2
"1521","i waked with this thought  and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream  that the disappointments which i felt upon coming to myself  and finding that it was no more than a dream  were equally extravagant the other way  and threw me into a very great dejection of spirits",1.35,-1,4,4
"1522","upon this  however  i made this conclusion  that my only way to go about to attempt an escape was  to endeavour to get a savage into my possession  and  if possible  it should be one of their prisoners  whom they had condemned to be eaten  and should bring hither to kill",-2.8,-3,-8,-3
"1523","but these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty  that it was impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them  and killing them all  and this was not only a very desperate attempt  and might miscarry  but  on the other hand  i had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself  and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood  though it was for my deliverance",-2.6,-4,-7,-4
"1524","i need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this  they being the same mentioned before  but though i had other reasons to offer now viz  that those men were enemies to my life  and would devour me if they could  that it was self preservation  in the highest degree  to deliver myself from this death of a life  and was acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting me  and the like  i say though these things argued for it  yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me  and such as i could by no means reconcile myself to for a great while",0.1,0,-3,0
"1525","however  at last  after many secret disputes with myself  and after great perplexities about it  for all these arguments  one way and another  struggled in my head a long time   the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest  and i resolved  if possible  to get one of these savages into my hands  cost what it would",0.75,0,4,3
"1526","my next thing was to contrive how to do it  and this  indeed  was very difficult to resolve on  but as i could pitch upon no probable means for it  so i resolved to put myself upon the watch  to see them when they came on shore  and leave the rest to the event  taking such measures as the opportunity should present  let what would be",1,-2,3,2
"1527","with these resolutions in my thoughts  i set myself upon the scout as often as possible  and indeed so often that i was heartily tired of it  for it was above a year and a half that i waited  and for great part of that time went out to the west end  and to the south west corner of the island almost every day  to look for canoes  but none appeared",0.25,1,1,0
"1528","this was very discouraging  and began to trouble me much  though i cannot say that it did in this case  as it had done some time before  wear off the edge of my desire to the thing  but the longer it seemed to be delayed  the more eager i was for it  in a word  i was not at first so careful to shun the sight of these savages  and avoid being seen by them  as i was now eager to be upon them",-2.65,-4,1,-2
"1529","besides  i fancied myself able to manage one  nay  two or three savages  if i had them  so as to make them entirely slaves to me  to do whatever i should direct them  and to prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt",-2.6,-3,-6,-1
"1530","it was a great while that i pleased myself with this affair  but nothing still presented itself  all my fancies and schemes came to nothing  for no savages came near me for a great while",0.25,1,5,1
"1531","about a year and a half after i entertained these notions  and by long musing had  as it were  resolved them all into nothing  for want of an occasion to put them into execution   i was surprised one morning by seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island  and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight",0.1,0,2,1
"1532","the number of them broke all my measures  for seeing so many  and knowing that they always came four or six  or sometimes more in a boat  i could not tell what to think of it  or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single handed  so lay still in my castle  perplexed and discomforted",-1.9,-3,-4,-2
"1533","however  i put myself into the same position for an attack that i had formerly provided  and was just ready for action  if anything had presented",0.3,0,-1,0
"1534","having waited a good while  listening to hear if they made any noise  at length  being very impatient  i set my guns at the foot of my ladder  and clambered up to the top of the hill  by my two stages  as usual  standing so  however  that my head did not appear above the hill  so that they could not perceive me by any means",0.15,0,3,3
"1535","here i observed  by the help of my perspective glass  that they were no less than thirty in number  that they had a fire kindled  and that they had meat dressed",-0.25,0,-1,0
"1536","how they had cooked it i knew not  or what it was  but they were all dancing  in i know not how many barbarous gestures and figures  their own way  round the fire",-1.25,-1,-4,0
"1537","while i was thus looking on them  i perceived  by my perspective  two miserable wretches dragged from the boats  where  it seems  they were laid by  and were now brought out for the slaughter",-2.25,-3,-4,-2
"1538","i perceived one of them immediately fall  being knocked down  i suppose  with a club or wooden sword  for that was their way  and two or three others were at work immediately  cutting him open for their cookery  while the other victim was left standing by himself  till they should be ready for him",0.05,1,-4,-2
"1539","in that very moment this poor wretch  seeing himself a little at liberty and unbound  nature inspired him with hopes of life  and he started away from them  and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands  directly towards me  i mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation was",2.25,2,2,2
"1540","i was dreadfully frightened  i must acknowledge  when i perceived him run my way  and especially when  as i thought  i saw him pursued by the whole body  and now i expected that part of my dream was coming to pass  and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove  but i could not depend  by any means  upon my dream  that the other savages would not pursue him thither and find him there",-1.6,-2,-1,-1
"1541","however  i kept my station  and my spirits began to recover when i found that there was not above three men that followed him  and still more was i encouraged  when i found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running  and gained ground on them  so that  if he could but hold out for half an hour  i saw easily he would fairly get away from them all",4.25,4,4,3
"1542","there was between them and my castle the creek  which i mentioned often in the first part of my story  where i landed my cargoes out of the ship  and this i saw plainly he must necessarily swim over  or the poor wretch would be taken there  but when the savage escaping came thither  he made nothing of it  though the tide was then up  but plunging in  swam through in about thirty strokes  or thereabouts  landed  and ran with exceeding strength and swiftness",-0.0499999999999999,-1,-1,1
"1543","when the three persons came to the creek  i found that two of them could swim  but the third could not  and that  standing on the other side  he looked at the others  but went no farther  and soon after went softly back again  which  as it happened  was very well for him in the end",1.4,1,-1,3
"1544","i observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice as strong swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from them",0.1,1,2,1
"1545","it came very warmly upon my thoughts  and indeed irresistibly  that now was the time to get me a servant  and  perhaps  a companion or assistant  and that i was plainly called by providence to save this poor creature s life",2.65,2,2,0
"1546","i immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition  fetched my two guns  for they were both at the foot of the ladders  as i observed before  and getting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill  i crossed towards the sea  and having a very short cut  and all down hill  placed myself in the way between the pursuers and the pursued  hallowing aloud to him that fled  who  looking back  was at first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them  but i beckoned with my hand to him to come back  and  in the meantime  i slowly advanced towards the two that followed  then rushing at once upon the foremost  i knocked him down with the stock of my piece",-0.4,2,0,3
"1547","i was loath to fire  because i would not have the rest hear  though  at that distance  it would not have been easily heard  and being out of sight of the smoke  too  they would not have known what to make of it",-1,-2,-2,0
"1548","having knocked this fellow down  the other who pursued him stopped  as if he had been frightened  and i advanced towards him  but as i came nearer  i perceived presently he had a bow and arrow  and was fitting it to shoot at me  so i was then obliged to shoot at him first  which i did  and killed him at the first shot",-1,0,-6,0
"1549","the poor savage who fled  but had stopped  though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed  as he thought  yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece that he stood stock still  and neither came forward nor went backward  though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on",-3.95,-7,-14,-3
"1550","i hallooed again to him  and made signs to come forward  which he easily understood  and came a little way  then stopped again  and then a little farther  and stopped again  and i could then perceive that he stood trembling  as if he had been taken prisoner  and had just been to be killed  as his two enemies were",-2.05,-3,-10,0
"1551","i beckoned to him again to come to me  and gave him all the signs of encouragement that i could think of  and he came nearer and nearer  kneeling down every ten or twelve steps  in token of acknowledgment for saving his life",2.45,2,2,2
"1552","i smiled at him  and looked pleasantly  and beckoned to him to come still nearer  at length he came close to me  and then he kneeled down again  kissed the ground  and laid his head upon the ground  and taking me by the foot  set my foot upon his head  this  it seems  was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever",0.85,1,-3,-1
"1553","i took him up and made much of him  and encouraged him all i could",0.8,0,2,0
"1554","but there was more work to do yet  for i perceived the savage whom i had knocked down was not killed  but stunned with the blow  and began to come to himself  so i pointed to him  and showed him the savage  that he was not dead  upon this he spoke some words to me  and though i could not understand them  yet i thought they were pleasant to hear  for they were the first sound of a man s voice that i had heard  my own excepted  for above twenty five years",-1.4,-1,-5,-3
"1555","but there was no time for such reflections now  the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground  and i perceived that my savage began to be afraid  but when i saw that  i presented my other piece at the man  as if i would shoot him  upon this my savage  for so i call him now  made a motion to me to lend him my sword  which hung naked in a belt by my side  which i did",-1.75,-3,-4,-4
"1556","he no sooner had it  but he runs to his enemy  and at one blow cut off his head so cleverly  no executioner in germany could have done it sooner or better  which i thought very strange for one who  i had reason to believe  never saw a sword in his life before  except their own wooden swords  however  it seems  as i learned afterwards  they make their wooden swords so sharp  so heavy  and the wood is so hard  that they will even cut off heads with them  ay  and arms  and that at one blow  too",-1,-1,-4,0
"1557","when he had done this  he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph  and brought me the sword again  and with abundance of gestures which i did not understand  laid it down  with the head of the savage that he had killed  just before me",0.95,0,2,1
"1558","but that which astonished him most was to know how i killed the other indian so far off  so  pointing to him  he made signs to me to let him go to him  and i bade him go  as well as i could",0.8,1,-1,0
"1559","when he came to him  he stood like one amazed  looking at him  turning him first on one side  then on the other  looked at the wound the bullet had made  which it seems was just in his breast  where it had made a hole  and no great quantity of blood had followed  but he had bled inwardly  for he was quite dead",-1,1,3,-1
"1560","he took up his bow and arrows  and came back  so i turned to go away  and beckoned him to follow me  making signs to him that more might come after them",0.5,1,0,0
"1561","upon this he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand  that they might not be seen by the rest  if they followed  and so i made signs to him again to do so",0,0,0,1
"1562","he fell to work  and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands big enough to bury the first in  and then dragged him into it  and covered him  and did so by the other also  i believe he had him buried them both in a quarter of an hour",-1.95,0,0,-2
"1563","then  calling away  i carried him  not to my castle  but quite away to my cave  on the farther part of the island  so i did not let my dream come to pass in that part  that he came into my grove for shelter",0.65,-1,1,1
"1564","here i gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat  and a draught of water  which i found he was indeed in great distress for  from his running  and having refreshed him  i made signs for him to go and lie down to sleep  showing him a place where i had laid some rice straw  and a blanket upon it  which i used to sleep upon myself sometimes  so the poor creature lay down  and went to sleep",0.45,-1,-1,-1
"1565","he was a comely  handsome fellow  perfectly well made  with straight  strong limbs  not too large  tall  and well shaped  and  as i reckon  about twenty six years of age",4.4,5,9,1
"1566","he had a very good countenance  not a fierce and surly aspect  but seemed to have something very manly in his face  and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a european in his countenance  too  especially when he smiled",1.3,1,5,1
"1567","his hair was long and black  not curled like wool  his forehead very high and large  and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes",1.25,3,8,-1
"1568","the colour of his skin was not quite black  but very tawny  and yet not an ugly  yellow  nauseous tawny  as the brazilians and virginians  and other natives of america are  but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour  that had in it something very agreeable  though not very easy to describe",0.55,2,3,-2
"1569","his face was round and plump  his nose small  not flat  like the negroes  a very good mouth  thin lips  and his fine teeth well set  and as white as ivory",2.7,4,7,1
"1570","after he had slumbered  rather than slept  about half an hour  he awoke again  and came out of the cave to me  for i had been milking my goats which i had in the enclosure just by  when he espied me he came running to me  laying himself down again upon the ground  with all the possible signs of an humble  thankful disposition  making a great many antic gestures to show it",2.1,2,6,1
"1571","at last he lays his head flat upon the ground  close to my foot  and sets my other foot upon his head  as he had done before  and after this made all the signs to me of subjection  servitude  and submission imaginable  to let me know how he would serve me so long as he lived",-1.25,-2,0,-3
"1572","i understood him in many things  and let him know i was very well pleased with him",1.55,2,3,1
"1573","in a little time i began to speak to him  and teach him to speak to me  and first  i let him know his name should be friday  which was the day i saved his life  i called him so for the memory of the time",1.2,0,2,1
"1574","i likewise taught him to say master  and then let him know that was to be my name  i likewise taught him to say yes and no and to know the meaning of them",0.8,1,0,1
"1575","i gave him some milk in an earthen pot  and let him see me drink it before him  and sop my bread in it  and gave him a cake of bread to do the like  which he quickly complied with  and made signs that it was very good for him",1.25,2,5,1
"1576","i kept there with him all that night  but as soon as it was day i beckoned to him to come with me  and let him know i would give him some clothes  at which he seemed very glad  for he was stark naked",0.75,1,3,0
"1577","as we went by the place where he had buried the two men  he pointed exactly to the place  and showed me the marks that he had made to find them again  making signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat them",0,0,0,0
"1578","at this i appeared very angry  expressed my abhorrence of it  made as if i would vomit at the thoughts of it  and beckoned with my hand to him to come away  which he did immediately  with great submission",-0.75,0,-3,-1
"1579","i then led him up to the top of the hill  to see if his enemies were gone  and pulling out my glass i looked  and saw plainly the place where they had been  but no appearance of them or their canoes  so that it was plain they were gone  and had left their two comrades behind them  without any search after them",-0.1,1,-1,1
"1580","but i was not content with this discovery  but having now more courage  and consequently more curiosity  i took my man friday with me  giving him the sword in his hand  with the bow and arrows at his back  which i found he could use very dexterously  making him carry one gun for me  and i two for myself  and away we marched to the place where these creatures had been  for i had a mind now to get some further intelligence of them",3.55,3,1,6
"1581","when i came to the place my very blood ran chill in my veins  and my heart sunk within me  at the horror of the spectacle  indeed  it was a dreadful sight  at least it was so to me  though friday made nothing of it",-1.95,-3,-3,-3
"1582","the place was covered with human bones  the ground dyed with their blood  and great pieces of flesh left here and there  half eaten  mangled  and scorched  and  in short  all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there  after a victory over their enemies",0.5,1,8,2
"1583","i saw three skulls  five hands  and the bones of three or four legs and feet  and abundance of other parts of the bodies  and friday  by his signs  made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast upon  that three of them were eaten up  and that he  pointing to himself  was the fourth  that there had been a great battle between them and their next king  of whose subjects  it seems  he had been one  and that they had taken a great number of prisoners  all which were carried to several places by those who had taken them in the fight  in order to feast upon them  as was done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither",-1,2,-1,-1
"1584","i caused friday to gather all the skulls  bones  flesh  and whatever remained  and lay them together in a heap  and make a great fire upon it  and burn them all to ashes",-0.95,0,1,-1
"1585","i found friday had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh  and was still a cannibal in his nature  but i showed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it  and at the least appearance of it  that he durst not discover it  for i had  by some means  let him know that i would kill him if he offered it",-0.65,-2,-3,-1
"1586","when he had done this  we came back to our castle  and there i fell to work for my man friday  and first of all  i gave him a pair of linen drawers  which i had out of the poor gunner s chest i mentioned  which i found in the wreck  and which  with a little alteration  fitted him very well  and then i made him a jerkin of goat s skin  as well as my skill would allow  for i was now grown a tolerably good tailor   and i gave him a cap which i made of hare s skin  very convenient  and fashionable enough  and thus he was clothed  for the present  tolerably well  and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master",4.9,7,3,6
"1587","it is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first  wearing the drawers was very awkward to him  and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms  but a little easing them where he complained they hurt him  and using himself to them  he took to them at length very well",-0.1,-1,-4,0
"1588","the next day  after i came home to my hutch with him  i began to consider where i should lodge him  and that i might do well for him and yet be perfectly easy myself  i made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortifications  in the inside of the last  and in the outside of the first",2.1,3,4,0
"1589","as there was a door or entrance there into my cave  i made a formal framed door case  and a door to it  of boards  and set it up in the passage  a little within the entrance  and  causing the door to open in the inside  i barred it up in the night  taking in my ladders  too  so that friday could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall  without making so much noise in getting over that it must needs awaken me  for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles  covering all my tent  and leaning up to the side of the hill  which was again laid across with smaller sticks  instead of laths  and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw  which was strong  like reeds  and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder i had placed a kind of trap door  which  if it had been attempted on the outside  would not have opened at all  but would have fallen down and made a great noise as to weapons  i took them all into my side every night",1.3,-1,5,-2
"1590","but i needed none of all this precaution  for never man had a more faithful  loving  sincere servant than friday was to me  without passions  sullenness  or designs  perfectly obliged and engaged  his very affections were tied to me  like those of a child to a father  and i daresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any occasion whatsoever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt  and soon convinced me that i needed to use no precautions for my safety on his account",5.55,3,14,5
"1591","this frequently gave me occasion to observe  and that with wonder  that however it had pleased god in his providence  and in the government of the works of his hands  to take from so great a part of the world of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted  yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers  the same reason  the same affections  the same sentiments of kindness and obligation  the same passions and resentments of wrongs  the same sense of gratitude  sincerity  fidelity  and all the capacities of doing good and receiving good that he has given to us  and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these  they are as ready  nay  more ready  to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed than we are",11.3,14,17,9
"1592","this made me very melancholy sometimes  in reflecting  as the several occasions presented  how mean a use we make of all these  even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction  the spirit of god  and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding  and why it has pleased god to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls  who  if i might judge by this poor savage  would make a much better use of it than we did",4.6,1,9,5
"1593","from hence i sometimes was led too far  to invade the sovereignty of providence  and  as it were  arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things  that should hide that sight from some  and reveal it to others  and yet expect a like duty from both  but i shut it up  and checked my thoughts with this conclusion  first  that we did not know by what light and law these should be condemned  but that as god was necessarily  and by the nature of his being  infinitely holy and just  so it could not be  but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from himself  it was on account of sinning against that light which  as the scripture says  was a law to themselves  and by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just  though the foundation was not discovered to us  and secondly  that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter  no vessel could say to him  why hast thou formed me thus",0.8,1,-1,2
"1594","but to return to my new companion",1.3,0,0,1
"1595","i was greatly delighted with him  and made it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make him useful  handy  and helpful  but especially to make him speak  and understand me when i spoke  and he was the aptest scholar that ever was  and particularly was so merry  so constantly diligent  and so pleased when he could but understand me  or make me understand him  that it was very pleasant for me to talk to him",7.65,9,16,9
"1596","now my life began to be so easy that i began to say to myself that could i but have been safe from more savages  i cared not if i was never to remove from the place where i lived",0.3,1,2,0
"1597","after i had been two or three days returned to my castle  i thought that  in order to bring friday off from his horrid way of feeding  and from the relish of a cannibal s stomach  i ought to let him taste other flesh  so i took him out with me one morning to the woods",-0.2,-1,-3,-2
"1598","i went  indeed  intending to kill a kid out of my own flock  and bring it home and dress it  but as i was going i saw a she goat lying down in the shade  and two young kids sitting by her",-0.85,-2,-3,-1
"1599","i catched hold of friday",0,0,0,0
"1600","hold  said i  stand still  and made signs to him not to stir  immediately i presented my piece  shot  and killed one of the kids",-0.9,-1,-3,-1
"1601","the poor creature  who had at a distance  indeed  seen me kill the savage  his enemy  but did not know  nor could imagine how it was done  was sensibly surprised  trembled  and shook  and looked so amazed that i thought he would have sunk down",-2.5,-3,-5,-4
"1602","he did not see the kid i shot at  or perceive i had killed it  but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he was not wounded  and  as i found presently  thought i was resolved to kill him  for he came and kneeled down to me  and embracing my knees  said a great many things i did not understand  but i could easily see the meaning was to pray me not to kill him",-0.1,-2,0,1
"1603","i soon found a way to convince him that i would do him no harm  and taking him up by the hand  laughed at him  and pointing to the kid which i had killed  beckoned to him to run and fetch it  which he did  and while he was wondering  and looking to see how the creature was killed  i loaded my gun again",0.4,-1,-5,-1
"1604","by and by i saw a great fowl  like a hawk  sitting upon a tree within shot  so  to let friday understand a little what i would do  i called him to me again  pointed at the fowl  which was indeed a parrot  though i thought it had been a hawk  i say  pointing to the parrot  and to my gun  and to the ground under the parrot  to let him see i would make it fall  i made him understand that i would shoot and kill that bird  accordingly  i fired  and bade him look  and immediately he saw the parrot fall",-1.65,0,-2,-5
"1605","he stood like one frightened again  notwithstanding all i had said to him  and i found he was the more amazed  because he did not see me put anything into the gun  but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing  able to kill man  beast  bird  or anything near or far off  and the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear off for a long time  and i believe  if i would have let him  he would have worshipped me and my gun",-0.65,1,-3,-4
"1606","as for the gun itself  he would not so much as touch it for several days after  but he would speak to it and talk to it  as if it had answered him  when he was by himself  which  as i afterwards learned of him  was to desire it not to kill him",-0.25,-1,-3,-1
"1607","well  after his astonishment was a little over at this  i pointed to him to run and fetch the bird i had shot  which he did  but stayed some time  for the parrot  not being quite dead  had fluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell  however  he found her  took her up  and brought her to me  and as i had perceived his ignorance about the gun before  i took this advantage to charge the gun again  and not to let him see me do it  that i might be ready for any other mark that might present  but nothing more offered at that time  so i brought home the kid  and the same evening i took the skin off  and cut it out as well as i could  and having a pot fit for that purpose  i boiled or stewed some of the flesh  and made some very good broth",1.2,2,-1,0
"1608","after i had begun to eat some i gave some to my man  who seemed very glad of it  and liked it very well  but that which was strangest to him was to see me eat salt with it",2.4,2,5,2
"1609","he made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat  and putting a little into his own mouth  he seemed to nauseate it  and would spit and sputter at it  washing his mouth with fresh water after it  on the other hand  i took some meat into my mouth without salt  and i pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt  as much as he had done at the salt  but it would not do  he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth  at least  not for a great while  and then but a very little",1.85,1,10,1
"1610","having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth  i was resolved to feast him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid  this i did by hanging it before the fire on a string  as i had seen many people do in england  setting two poles up  one on each side of the fire  and one across the top  and tying the string to the cross stick  letting the meat turn continually",0.1,1,2,-1
"1611","this friday admired very much  but when he came to taste the flesh  he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it  that i could not but understand him  and at last he told me  as well as he could  he would never eat man s flesh any more  which i was very glad to hear",3.15,3,8,2
"1612","the next day i set him to work beating some corn out  and sifting it in the manner i used to do  as i observed before  and he soon understood how to do it as well as i  especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was  and that it was to make bread of  for after that i let him see me make my bread  and bake it too  and in a little time friday was able to do all the work for me as well as i could do it myself",0.55,2,-1,-1
"1613","i began now to consider  that having two mouths to feed instead of one  i must provide more ground for my harvest  and plant a larger quantity of corn than i used to do  so i marked out a larger piece of land  and began the fence in the same manner as before  in which friday worked not only very willingly and very hard  but did it very cheerfully  and i told him what it was for  that it was for corn to make more bread  because he was now with me  and that i might have enough for him and myself too",2.65,2,1,5
"1614","he appeared very sensible of that part  and let me know that he thought i had much more labour upon me on his account than i had for myself  and that he would work the harder for me if i would tell him what to do",1.05,2,0,0
"1615","this was the pleasantest year of all the life i led in this place",0.4,1,0,0
"1616","friday began to talk pretty well  and understand the names of almost everything i had occasion to call for  and of every place i had to send him to  and talked a great deal to me  so that  in short  i began now to have some use for my tongue again  which  indeed  i had very little occasion for before",2.7,3,4,3
"1617","besides the pleasure of talking to him  i had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself  his simple  unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day  and i began really to love the creature  and on his side i believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love anything before",2.4,4,9,2
"1618","i had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country again  and having taught him english so well that he could answer me almost any question  i asked him whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle",0.3,1,-1,0
"1619","at which he smiled  and said yes  yes  we always fight the better  that is  he meant always get the better in fight  and so we began the following discourse",1.9,1,4,-1

"1651","i have told this passage  because it introduces what follows  that after this discourse i had with him  i asked him how far it was from our island to the shore  and whether the canoes were not often lost",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"1652","he told me there was no danger  no canoes ever lost  but that after a little way out to sea  there was a current and wind  always one way in the morning  the other in the afternoon",-1.5,-2,-6,-1
"1653","this i understood to be no more than the sets of the tide  as going out or coming in  but i afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river orinoco  in the mouth or gulf of which river  as i found afterwards  our island lay  and that this land  which i perceived to be w  and nw",1.85,2,2,2
"1654","was the great island trinidad  on the north point of the mouth of the river",0.5,1,3,0
"1655","i asked friday a thousand questions about the country  the inhabitants  the sea  the coast  and what nations were near  he told me all he knew with the greatest openness imaginable",1.6,2,3,3
"1656","i asked him the names of the several nations of his sort of people  but could get no other name than caribs  from whence i easily understood that these were the caribbees  which our maps place on the part of america which reaches from the mouth of the river orinoco to guiana  and onwards to st  martha",0,0,0,0
"1657","he told me that up a great way beyond the moon  that was beyond the setting of the moon  which must be west from their country  there dwelt white bearded men  like me  and pointed to my great whiskers  which i mentioned before  and that they had killed much mans  that was his word  by all which i understood he meant the spaniards  whose cruelties in america had been spread over the whole country  and were remembered by all the nations from father to son",-0.1,0,2,2
"1658","i inquired if he could tell me how i might go from this island  and get among those white men",0.4,0,0,1

"1660","i could not understand what he meant  or make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe  till at last  with great difficulty  i found he meant it must be in a large boat  as big as two canoes",0.85,0,4,0
"1661","this part of friday s discourse i began to relish very well  and from this time i entertained some hopes that  one time or other  i might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place  and that this poor savage might be a means to help me",1.95,0,3,1
"1662","during the long time that friday had now been with me  and that he began to speak to me  and understand me  i was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind  particularly i asked him one time  who made him",1,0,0,1
"1663","the creature did not understand me at all  but thought i had asked who was his father but i took it up by another handle  and asked him who made the sea  the ground we walked on  and the hills and woods",-0.25,0,0,0
"1664","he told me  it was one benamuckee  that lived beyond all  he could describe nothing of this great person  but that he was very old  much older  he said  than the sea or land  than the moon or the stars",0.5,1,3,2
"1665","i asked him then  if this old person had made all things  why did not all things worship him",0.25,0,0,1
"1666","he looked very grave  and  with a perfect look of innocence  said  all things say o to him",1.05,1,1,1

"1668","he said  yes  they all went to benamuckee",0.8,0,1,0
"1669","then i asked him whether those they eat up went thither too",0.6,0,0,1
"1670","he said  yes",0.8,0,1,0
"1671","from these things  i began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true god  i told him that the great maker of all things lived up there  pointing up towards heaven  that he governed the world by the same power and providence by which he made it  that he was omnipotent  and could do everything for us  give everything to us  take everything from us  and thus  by degrees  i opened his eyes",3.4,3,8,4
"1672","he listened with great attention  and received with pleasure the notion of jesus christ being sent to redeem us  and of the manner of making our prayers to god  and his being able to hear us  even in heaven",3.65,4,10,4
"1673","he told me one day  that if our god could hear us  up beyond the sun  he must needs be a greater god than their benamuckee  who lived but a little way off  and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to them",1.6,1,7,3
"1674","i asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him",0,0,0,0
"1675","he said  no  they never went that were young men  none went thither but the old men  whom he called their oowokakee  that is  as i made him explain to me  their religious  or clergy  and that they went to say o  so he called saying prayers   and then came back and told them what benamuckee said",0.4,0,-1,2
"1676","by this i observed  that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded  ignorant pagans in the world  and the policy of making a secret of religion  in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy  not only to be found in the roman  but  perhaps  among all religions in the world  even among the most brutish and barbarous savages",-3.7,-4,-4,1
"1677","i endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man friday  and told him that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say o to their god benamuckee was a cheat  and their bringing word from thence what he said was much more so  that if they met with any answer  or spake with any one there  it must be with an evil spirit  and then i entered into a long discourse with him about the devil  the origin of him  his rebellion against god  his enmity to man  the reason of it  his setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of god  and as god  and the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin  how he had a secret access to our passions and to our affections  and to adapt his snares to our inclinations  so as to because us even to be our own tempters  and run upon our destruction by our own choice",-2.5,-9,-14,-1
"1678","i found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the devil as it was about the being of a god",1.7,1,2,1
"1679","nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great first because  an overruling  governing power  a secret directing providence  and of the equity and justice of paying homage to him that made us  and the like  but there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit  of his origin  his being  his nature  and above all  of his inclination to do evil  and to draw us in to do so too  and the poor creature puzzled me once in such a manner  by a question merely natural and innocent  that i scarce knew what to say to him",3.75,0,4,5
"1680","i had been talking a great deal to him of the power of god  his omnipotence  his aversion to sin  his being a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity  how  as he had made us all  he could destroy us and all the world in a moment  and he listened with great seriousness to me all the while",-2,-4,-3,-1
"1681","after this i had been telling him how the devil was god s enemy in the hearts of men  and used all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of providence  and to ruin the kingdom of christ in the world  and the like",-0.9,1,0,-3
"1682","well  says friday  but you say god is so strong  so great  is he not much strong  much might as the devil",1.3,2,6,0
"1683","yes  yes  says i  friday  god is stronger than the devil god is above the devil  and therefore we pray to god to tread him down under our feet  and enable us to resist his temptations and quench his fiery darts",1.15,1,5,1
"1684","but  says he again  if god much stronger  much might as the wicked devil  why god no kill the devil  so make him no more do wicked",-1.5,-2,-3,-2
"1685","i was strangely surprised at this question  and  after all  though i was now an old man  yet i was but a young doctor  and ill qualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties  and at first i could not tell what to say  so i pretended not to hear him  and asked him what he said  but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question  so that he repeated it in the very same broken words as above",-1.35,-1,-3,-1
"1686","by this time i had recovered myself a little  and i said  god will at last punish him severely  he is reserved for the judgment  and is to be cast into the bottomless pit  to dwell with everlasting fire",-0.5,0,-5,1
"1687","this did not satisfy friday  but he returns upon me  repeating my words   reserve at last   me no understand but why not kill the devil now  not kill great ago",0.65,0,-1,-2
"1688","you may as well ask me  said i  why god does not kill you or me  when we do wicked things here that offend him we are preserved to repent and be pardoned",-1.05,-2,-4,-1
"1689","he mused some time on this",0,0,0,0
"1690","well  well  says he  mighty affectionately  that well so you  i  devil  all wicked  all preserve  repent  god pardon all",0.5,1,1,3
"1691","here i was run down again by him to the last degree  and it was a testimony to me  how the mere notions of nature  though they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a god  and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of god  as the consequence of our nature  yet nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge of jesus christ  and of redemption purchased for us  of a mediator of the new covenant  and of an intercessor at the footstool of god s throne  i say  nothing but a revelation from heaven can form these in the soul  and that  therefore  the gospel of our lord and saviour jesus christ  i mean the word of god  and the spirit of god  promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people  are the absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of god and the means of salvation",10.2,9,12,15
"1692","i therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man  rising up hastily  as upon some sudden occasion of going out  then sending him for something a good way off  i seriously prayed to god that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage  assisting  by his spirit  the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of god in christ  reconciling him to himself  and would guide me so to speak to him from the word of god that his conscience might be convinced  his eyes opened  and his soul saved",2.45,-3,4,8
"1693","when he came again to me  i entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject of the redemption of man by the saviour of the world  and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from heaven  viz  of repentance towards god  and faith in our blessed lord jesus",2.15,3,5,4
"1694","i then explained to him as well as i could why our blessed redeemer took not on him the nature of angels but the seed of abraham  and how  for that reason  the fallen angels had no share in the redemption  that he came only to the lost sheep of the house of israel  and the like",2.4,1,-3,3
"1695","i had  god knows  more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods i took for this poor creature s instruction  and must acknowledge  what i believe all that act upon the same principle will find  that in laying things open to him  i really informed and instructed myself in many things that either i did not know or had not fully considered before  but which occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them  for the information of this poor savage  and i had more affection in my inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever i felt before  so that  whether this poor wild wretch was better for me or no  i had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me  my grief sat lighter  upon me  my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure  and when i reflected that in this solitary life which i have been confined to  i had not only been moved to look up to heaven myself  and to seek the hand that had brought me here  but was now to be made an instrument  under providence  to save the life  and  for aught i knew  the soul of a poor savage  and bring him to the true knowledge of religion and of the christian doctrine  that he might know christ jesus  in whom is life eternal  i say  when i reflected upon all these things  a secret joy ran through every part of my soul  and i frequently rejoiced that ever i was brought to this place  which i had so often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me",7.75,3,21,6
"1696","i continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time  and the conversation which employed the hours between friday and me was such as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and completely happy  if any such thing as complete happiness can be formed in a sublunary state",3.4,4,11,4
"1697","this savage was now a good christian  a much better than i  though i have reason to hope  and bless god for it  that we were equally penitent  and comforted  restored penitents",4.25,3,11,5
"1698","we had here the word of god to read  and no farther off from his spirit to instruct than if we had been in england",0.9,0,1,4
"1699","i always applied myself  in reading the scripture  to let him know  as well as i could  the meaning of what i read  and he again  by his serious inquiries and questionings  made me  as i said before  a much better scholar in the scripture knowledge than i should ever have been by my own mere private reading",2.9,2,2,3
"1700","another thing i cannot refrain from observing here also  from experience in this retired part of my life  viz  how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is that the knowledge of god  and of the doctrine of salvation by christ jesus  is so plainly laid down in the word of god  so easy to be received and understood  that  as the bare reading the scripture made me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance for my sins  and laying hold of a saviour for life and salvation  to a stated reformation in practice  and obedience to all god s commands  and this without any teacher or instructor  i mean human  so the same plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature  and bringing him to be such a christian as i have known few equal to him in my life",10.15,7,14,14
"1701","as to all the disputes  wrangling  strife  and contention which have happened in the world about religion  whether niceties in doctrines or schemes of church government  they were all perfectly useless to us  and  for aught i can yet see  they have been so to the rest of the world",-2,-2,-1,-2
"1702","we had the sure guide to heaven  viz  the word of god  and we had  blessed be god  comfortable views of the spirit of god teaching and instructing by his word  leading us into all truth  and making us both willing and obedient to the instruction of his word",5.85,4,8,7
"1703","and i cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of religion  which have made such confusion in the world  would have been to us  if we could have obtained it",0.9,-1,1,0
"1704","but i must go on with the historical part of things  and take every part in its order",0,0,0,0
"1705","after friday and i became more intimately acquainted  and that he could understand almost all i said to him  and speak pretty fluently  though in broken english  to me  i acquainted him with my own history  or at least so much of it as related to my coming to this place  how i had lived there  and how long  i let him into the mystery  for such it was to him  of gunpowder and bullet  and taught him how to shoot",-1.3,-1,-1,-1
"1706","i gave him a knife  which he was wonderfully delighted with  and i made him a belt  with a frog hanging to it  such as in england we wear hangers in  and in the frog  instead of a hanger  i gave him a hatchet  which was not only as good a weapon in some cases  but much more useful upon other occasions",2.1,3,12,0
"1707","i described to him the country of europe  particularly england  which i came from  how we lived  how we worshipped god  how we behaved to one another  and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world",0.25,0,1,1
"1708","i gave him an account of the wreck which i had been on board of  and showed him  as near as i could  the place where she lay  but she was all beaten in pieces before  and gone",-1.75,-1,-4,-1
"1709","i showed him the ruins of our boat  which we lost when we escaped  and which i could not stir with my whole strength then  but was now fallen almost all to pieces",-1.25,-3,-5,0
"1710","upon seeing this boat  friday stood  musing a great while  and said nothing",0.5,1,3,0
"1711","i asked him what it was he studied upon",0,0,0,0
"1712","at last says he  me see such boat like come to place at my nation",0.5,1,2,0
"1713","i did not understand him a good while  but at last  when i had examined further into it  i understood by him that a boat  such as that had been  came on shore upon the country where he lived  that is  as he explained it  was driven thither by stress of weather",0,0,2,0
"1714","i presently imagined that some european ship must have been cast away upon their coast  and the boat might get loose and drive ashore  but was so dull that i never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck thither  much less whence they might come  so i only inquired after a description of the boat",-1.4,-3,-8,-1
"1715","friday described the boat to me well enough  but brought me better to understand him when he added with some warmth  we save the white mans from drown",2.25,4,4,1
"1716","then i presently asked if there were any white mans  as he called them  in the boat",0.4,0,0,1
"1717","yes  he said  the boat full of white mans",1.2,0,1,2
"1718","i asked him how many",0,0,0,0
"1719","he told upon his fingers seventeen",0,0,0,0
"1720","i asked him then what became of them",0,0,0,0
"1721","he told me  they live  they dwell at my nation",0,0,0,0
"1722","this put new thoughts into my head  for i presently imagined that these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight of my island  as i now called it  and who  after the ship was struck on the rock  and they saw her inevitably lost  had saved themselves in their boat  and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages",-1.4,-5,-2,0
"1723","upon this i inquired of him more critically what was become of them",0,0,0,0
"1724","he assured me they lived still there  that they had been there about four years  that the savages left them alone  and gave them victuals to live on",-0.8,-1,-2,1
"1725","i asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them",-0.15,-1,-3,0
"1726","he said  no  they make brother with them  that is  as i understood him  a truce  and then he added  they no eat mans but when make the war fight  that is to say  they never eat any men but such as come to fight with them and are taken in battle",0.1,0,-5,0
"1727","it was after this some considerable time  that being upon the top of the hill at the east side of the island  from whence  as i have said  i had  in a clear day  discovered the main or continent of america  friday  the weather being very serene  looks very earnestly towards the mainland  and  in a kind of surprise  falls a jumping and dancing  and calls out to me  for i was at some distance from him",3.35,3,7,4
"1728","i asked him what was the matter",0,0,1,0
"1729","oh  joy  says he  oh  glad  there see my country  there my nation",1.5,2,6,2
"1730","i observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face  and his eyes sparkled  and his countenance discovered a strange eagerness  as if he had a mind to be in his own country again",1.5,2,2,3
"1731","this observation of mine put a great many thoughts into me  which made me at first not so easy about my new man friday as i was before  and i made no doubt but that  if friday could get back to his own nation again  he would not only forget all his religion but all his obligation to me  and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me  and come back  perhaps with a hundred or two of them  and make a feast upon me  at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies when they were taken in war",1.2,2,0,-1
"1732","but i wronged the poor honest creature very much  for which i was very sorry afterwards",-1,-1,-3,0
"1733","however  as my jealousy increased  and held some weeks  i was a little more circumspect  and not so familiar and kind to him as before  in which i was certainly wrong too  the honest  grateful creature having no thought about it but what consisted with the best principles  both as a religious christian and as a grateful friend  as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction",3.5,1,7,3
"1734","while my jealousy of him lasted  you may be sure i was every day pumping him to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which i suspected were in him  but i found everything he said was so honest and so innocent  that i could find nothing to nourish my suspicion  and in spite of all my uneasiness  he made me at last entirely his own again  nor did he in the least perceive that i was uneasy  and therefore i could not suspect him of deceit",-2.1,-5,-7,-3
"1735","one day  walking up the same hill  but the weather being hazy at sea  so that we could not see the continent  i called to him  and said  friday  do not you wish yourself in your own country  your own nation",0.4,-1,1,1
"1736","yes  he said  i be much o glad to be at my own nation",1.55,1,4,1
"1737","what would you do there",0,0,0,0
"1738","said i  would you turn wild again  eat men s flesh again  and be a savage as you were before",-0.15,-2,0,-1
"1739","he looked full of concern  and shaking his head  said  no  no  friday tell them to live good  tell them to pray god  tell them to eat corn bread  cattle flesh  milk  no eat man again",0.85,0,4,4
"1740","why  then  said i to him  they will kill you",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"1741","he looked grave at that  and then said  no  no  they no kill me  they willing love learn",1.1,1,-3,0
"1742","he meant by this  they would be willing to learn",1.6,1,0,1
"1743","he added  they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat",0,0,0,0
"1744","then i asked him if he would go back to them",0,0,0,0
"1745","he smiled at that  and told me that he could not swim so far",0.8,0,2,1
"1746","i told him i would make a canoe for him",0,0,0,0
"1747","he told me he would go if i would go with him",0,0,0,0
"1748","i go  says i  why  they will eat me if i come there",0.6,0,0,1
"1749","no  no  says he  me make they no eat you  me make they much love you",1.35,1,2,2
"1750","he meant  he would tell them how i had killed his enemies  and saved his life  and so he would make them love me",0.55,-1,0,1
"1751","then he told me  as well as he could  how kind they were to seventeen white men  or bearded men  as he called them who came on shore there in distress",0.7,0,0,1
"1752","from this time  i confess  i had a mind to venture over  and see if i could possibly join with those bearded men  who i made no doubt were spaniards and portuguese  not doubting but  if i could  we might find some method to escape from thence  being upon the continent  and a good company together  better than i could from an island forty miles off the shore  alone and without help",-0.8,0,2,0
"1753","so  after some days  i took friday to work again by way of discourse  and told him i would give him a boat to go back to his own nation  and  accordingly  i carried him to my frigate  which lay on the other side of the island  and having cleared it of water  for i always kept it sunk in water   i brought it out  showed it him  and we both went into it",0.5,1,1,-1
"1754","i found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it  and would make it go almost as swift again as i could",2.15,2,2,3
"1755","so when he was in  i said to him  well  now  friday  shall we go to your nation",0.8,1,0,0
"1756","he looked very dull at my saying so  which it seems was because he thought the boat was too small to go so far",-0.75,-1,-2,-2
"1757","i then told him i had a bigger  so the next day i went to the place where the first boat lay which i had made  but which i could not get into the water",0,0,0,0
"1758","he said that was big enough  but then  as i had taken no care of it  and it had lain two or three and twenty years there  the sun had so split and dried it  that it was rotten",0.6,-1,-1,0
"1759","friday told me such a boat would do very well  and would carry much enough vittle  drink  bread  this was his way of talking",0.55,2,0,0
"1760","upon the whole  i was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over with him to the continent that i told him we would go and make one as big as that  and he should go home in it",0.25,0,1,0
"1761","he answered not one word  but looked very grave and sad",-1,-1,-4,0
"1762","i asked him what was the matter with him",0,0,1,0
"1763","he asked me again  why you angry mad with friday",-1.5,-2,-6,-2
"1764","what me done",0,0,0,0
"1765","i asked him what he meant",0,0,0,0
"1766","i told him i was not angry with him at all",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"1767","no angry  says he  repeating the words several times  why send friday home away to my nation",-0.75,-1,-4,-2
"1768","why  says i  friday  did not you say you wished you were there",0,0,0,0
"1769","yes  yes  says he  wish we both there  no wish friday there  no master there",1.6,1,1,1
"1770","in a word  he would not think of going there without me  i go there  friday",0,0,0,1
"1771","says i  what shall i do there",0,0,0,0
"1772","he turned very quick upon me at this",0,0,0,0
"1773","you do great deal much good  says he  you teach wild mans be good  sober  tame mans  you tell them know god  pray god  and live new life",2.55,0,8,4
"1774","alas  friday  says i  thou knowest not what thou sayest  i am but an ignorant man myself",-1.4,-1,-3,-1
"1775","yes  yes  says he  you teachee me good  you teachee them good",1.55,1,4,1
"1776","no  no  friday  says i  you shall go without me  leave me here to live by myself  as i did before",-0.25,0,-2,-1
"1777","he looked confused again at that word  and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear  he takes it up hastily  and gives it to me",-0.9,-2,-2,0
"1778","what must i do with this",0,0,0,0
"1779","says i to him",0,0,0,0
"1780","you take kill friday  says he",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"1781","what must kill you for",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"1782","said i again",0,0,0,0
"1783","he returns very quick what you send friday away for",0,0,0,0
"1784","take kill friday  no send friday away",-0.75,-1,-4,-1
"1785","this he spoke so earnestly that i saw tears stand in his eyes",-0.3,1,-2,0
"1786","in a word  i so plainly discovered the utmost affection in him to me  and a firm resolution in him  that i told him then and often after  that i would never send him away from me if he was willing to stay with me",2.2,2,5,2
"1787","upon the whole  as i found by all his discourse a settled affection to me  and that nothing could part him from me  so i found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people  and his hopes of my doing them good  a thing which  as i had no notion of myself  so i had not the least thought or intention  or desire of undertaking it",4.7,3,9,6
"1788","but still i found a strong inclination to attempting my escape  founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse  that there were seventeen bearded men there  and therefore  without any more delay  i went to work with friday to find out a great tree proper to fell  and make a large periagua  or canoe  to undertake the voyage",0.85,2,3,1
"1789","there were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet  not of periaguas or canoes  but even of good  large vessels  but the main thing i looked at was  to get one so near the water that we might launch it when it was made  to avoid the mistake i committed at first",-0.2,1,1,3
"1790","at last friday pitched upon a tree  for i found he knew much better than i what kind of wood was fittest for it  nor can i tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down  except that it was very like the tree we call fustic  or between that and the nicaragua wood  for it was much of the same colour and smell",1.9,1,5,2
"1791","friday wished to burn the hollow or cavity of this tree out  to make it for a boat  but i showed him how to cut it with tools  which  after i had showed him how to use  he did very handily  and in about a month s hard labour we finished it and made it very handsome  especially when  with our axes  which i showed him how to handle  we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat",0.45,-1,2,2
"1792","after this  however  it cost us near a fortnight s time to get her along  as it were inch by inch  upon great rollers into the water  but when she was in  she would have carried twenty men with great ease",1.25,2,5,1
"1793","when she was in the water  though she was so big  it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man friday could manage her  turn her  and paddle her along",2.3,2,5,4
"1794","so i asked him if he would  and if we might venture over in her",0,0,0,0
"1795","yes  he said  we venture over in her very well  though great blow wind",1.7,1,4,0
"1796","however i had a further design that he knew nothing of  and that was  to make a mast and a sail  and to fit her with an anchor and cable",0.4,0,1,1
"1797","as to a mast  that was easy enough to get  so i pitched upon a straight young cedar tree  which i found near the place  and which there were great plenty of in the island  and i set friday to work to cut it down  and gave him directions how to shape and order it",2.65,4,4,4
"1798","but as to the sail  that was my particular care",1,0,2,0
"1799","i knew i had old sails  or rather pieces of old sails  enough  but as i had had them now six and twenty years by me  and had not been very careful to preserve them  not imagining that i should ever have this kind of use for them  i did not doubt but they were all rotten  and  indeed  most of them were so",-0.15,-1,0,2
"1800","however  i found two pieces which appeared pretty good  and with these i went to work  and with a great deal of pains  and awkward stitching  you may be sure  for want of needles  i at length made a three cornered ugly thing  like what we call in england a shoulder of mutton sail  to go with a boom at bottom  and a little short sprit at the top  such as usually our ships long boats sail with  and such as i best knew how to manage  as it was such a one as i had to the boat in which i made my escape from barbary  as related in the first part of my story",1.05,5,7,4
"1801","i was near two months performing this last work  viz  rigging and fitting my masts and sails  for i finished them very complete  making a small stay  and a sail  or foresail  to it  to assist if we should turn to windward  and  what was more than all  i fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with",0.7,0,0,0
"1802","i was but a bungling shipwright  yet as i knew the usefulness and even necessity of such a thing  i applied myself with so much pains to do it  that at last i brought it to pass  though  considering the many dull contrivances i had for it that failed  i think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat",-1.8,-4,-2,-1
"1803","after all this was done  i had my man friday to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat  though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe  he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder  and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder  and how the sail jibed  and filled this way or that way as the course we sailed changed  i say when he saw this he stood like one astonished and amazed",2.95,5,6,3
"1804","however  with a little use  i made all these things familiar to him  and he became an expert sailor  except that of the compass i could make him understand very little",1.4,0,0,2
"1805","on the other hand  as there was very little cloudy weather  and seldom or never any fogs in those parts  there was the less occasion for a compass  seeing the stars were always to be seen by night  and the shore by day  except in the rainy seasons  and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea",-0.5,-1,-1,2
"1806","i was now entered on the seven and twentieth year of my captivity in this place  though the three last years that i had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account  my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of the time",-0.35,0,2,0
"1807","i kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to god for his mercies as at first  and if i had such because of acknowledgment at first  i had much more so now  having such additional testimonies of the care of providence over me  and the great hopes i had of being effectually and speedily delivered  for i had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand  and that i should not be another year in this place",4.5,4,10,4
"1808","i went on  however  with my husbandry  digging  planting  and fencing as usual",0.15,0,0,2
"1809","i gathered and cured my grapes  and did every necessary thing as before",0,0,0,0

"1811","we had stowed our new vessel as secure as we could  bringing her up into the creek  where  as i said in the beginning  i landed my rafts from the ship  and hauling her up to the shore at high water mark  i made my man friday dig a little dock  just big enough to hold her  and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in  and then  when the tide was out  we made a strong dam across the end of it  to keep the water out  and so she lay  dry as to the tide from the sea  and to keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees  so thick that she was as well thatched as a house  and thus we waited for the months of november and december  in which i designed to make my adventure",3.6,5,10,3
"1812","when the settled season began to come in  as the thought of my design returned with the fair weather  i was preparing daily for the voyage",0.75,1,2,1

"1814","i was busy one morning upon something of this kind  when i called to friday  and bid him to go to the sea shore and see if he could find a turtle or a tortoise  a thing which we generally got once a week  for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh",1.3,1,2,2
"1815","friday had not been long gone when he came running back  and flew over my outer wall or fence  like one that felt not the ground or the steps he set his foot on  and before i had time to speak to him he cries out to me  o master",-0.5,2,0,1

"1825","i comforted him as well as i could  and told him i was in as much danger as he  and that they would eat me as well as him",0.65,0,-2,0

"1829","no matter for that  said i again  our guns will fright them that we do not kill",-1.5,-2,-5,-2

"1831","he said  me die when you bid die  master",-0.75,0,-3,0
"1832","so i went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him  for i had been so good a husband of my rum that i had a great deal left",1.5,2,6,2
"1833","when we had drunk it  i made him take the two fowling pieces  which we always carried  and loaded them with large swan shot  as big as small pistol bullets",-1.05,-1,-1,-3

"1836","when i had thus prepared myself  i took my perspective glass  and went up to the side of the hill  to see what i could discover  and i found quickly by my glass that there were one and twenty savages  three prisoners  and three canoes  and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies  a barbarous feast  indeed  but nothing more than  as i had observed  was usual with them",0.0499999999999999,-1,1,5
"1837","i observed also that they had landed  not where they had done when friday made his escape  but nearer to my creek  where the shore was low  and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea",-0.25,0,-1,2
"1838","this  with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about  filled me with such indignation that i came down again to friday  and told him i was resolved to go down to them and kill them all  and asked him if he would stand by me",-1.8,-3,-5,-2
"1839","he had now got over his fright  and his spirits being a little raised with the dram i had given him  he was very cheerful  and told me  as before  he would die when i bid die",-0.5,-1,-3,0
"1840","in this fit of fury i divided the arms which i had charged  as before  between us  i gave friday one pistol to stick in his girdle  and three guns upon his shoulder  and i took one pistol and the other three guns myself  and in this posture we marched out",-0.5,-1,-2,-1
"1841","i took a small bottle of rum in my pocket  and gave friday a large bag with more powder and bullets  and as to orders  i charged him to keep close behind me  and not to stir  or shoot  or do anything till i bid him  and in the meantime not to speak a word",-0.5,0,-4,-1
"1842","in this posture i fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile  as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood  so that i could come within shot of them before i should be discovered  which i had seen by my glass it was easy to do",2,3,1,-1
"1843","while i was making this march  my former thoughts returning  i began to abate my resolution  i do not mean that i entertained any fear of their number  for as they were naked  unarmed wretches  it is certain i was superior to them nay  though i had been alone",0.7,0,1,1
"1844","but it occurred to my thoughts  what call  what occasion  much less what necessity i was in to go and dip my hands in blood  to attack people who had neither done or intended me any wrong",-1.75,-2,-3,-1
"1845","who  as to me  were innocent  and whose barbarous customs were their own disaster  being in them a token  indeed  of god s having left them  with the other nations of that part of the world  to such stupidity  and to such inhuman courses  but did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions  much less an executioner of his justice that whenever he thought fit he would take the because into his own hands  and by national vengeance punish them as a people for national crimes  but that  in the meantime  it was none of my business that it was true friday might justify it  because he was a declared enemy and in a state of war with those very particular people  and it was lawful for him to attack them but i could not say the same with regard to myself",-4.85,-6,-13,-4
"1846","these things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as i went  that i resolved i would only go and place myself near them that i might observe their barbarous feast  and that i would act then as god should direct  but that unless something offered that was more a call to me than yet i knew of  i would not meddle with them",0.1,-1,1,0
"1847","with this resolution i entered the wood  and  with all possible wariness and silence  friday following close at my heels  i marched till i came to the skirts of the wood on the side which was next to them  only that one corner of the wood lay between me and them",-1,-1,2,0
"1848","here i called softly to friday  and showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the wood  i bade him go to the tree  and bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing",0.5,1,3,2
"1849","he did so  and came immediately back to me  and told me they might be plainly viewed there that they were all about their fire  eating the flesh of one of their prisoners  and that another lay bound upon the sand a little from them  whom he said they would kill next  and this fired the very soul within me",-2.55,-1,-9,-2
"1850","he told me it was not one of their nation  but one of the bearded men he had told me of  that came to their country in the boat",0,0,0,0

"1852","there was another tree and a little thicket beyond it  about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where i was  which  by going a little way about  i saw i might come at undiscovered  and that then i should be within half a shot of them  so i withheld my passion  though i was indeed enraged to the highest degree  and going back about twenty paces  i got behind some bushes  which held all the way till i came to the other tree  and then came to a little rising ground  which gave me a full view of them at the distance of about eighty yards",-0.9,0,-1,4
"1853","i had now not a moment to lose  for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground  all close huddled together  and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor christian  and bring him perhaps limb by limb to their fire  and they were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet",-2.25,-4,-7,-3

"1859","then fire at them  said i  and at the same moment i fired also",-0.75,0,-4,0

"1862","friday kept his eyes close upon me  that  as i had bid him  he might observe what i did  so  as soon as the first shot was made  i threw down the piece  and took up the fowling piece  and friday did the like  he saw me cock and present  he did the same again",0.1,1,-3,0

"1864","said i  yes  says he",0.8,0,1,0
"1865","let fly  then  says i  in the name of god  and with that i fired again among the amazed wretches  and so did friday  and as our pieces were now loaded with what i call swan shot  or small pistol bullets  we found only two drop  but so many were wounded that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures  all bloody  and most of them miserably wounded  whereof three more fell quickly after  though not quite dead",-3.7,-3,-12,-6
"1866","now  friday  says i  laying down the discharged pieces  and taking up the musket which was yet loaded  follow me  which he did with a great deal of courage  upon which i rushed out of the wood and showed myself  and friday close at my foot",1.5,2,5,2
"1867","as soon as i perceived they saw me  i shouted as loud as i could  and bade friday do so too  and running as fast as i could  which  by the way  was not very fast  being loaded with arms as i was  i made directly towards the poor victim  who was  as i said  lying upon the beach or shore  between the place where they sat and the sea",-2,-2,-5,-1
"1868","the two butchers who were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our first fire  and fled in a terrible fright to the seaside  and had jumped into a canoe  and three more of the rest made the same way",-1.7,-1,-7,0

"1872","i took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it him  making signs that he should drink  which he did  and i gave him a piece of bread  which he ate",0,0,0,0

"1874","seignior  said i  with as much spanish as i could make up  we will talk afterwards  but we must fight now  if you have any strength left  take this pistol and sword  and lay about you",0,0,1,0
"1875","he took them very thankfully  and no sooner had he the arms in his hands  but  as if they had put new vigour into him  he flew upon his murderers like a fury  and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant  for the truth is  as the whole was a surprise to them  so the poor creatures were so much frightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for mere amazement and fear  and had no more power to attempt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot  and that was the case of those five that friday shot at in the boat  for as three of them fell with the hurt they received  so the other two fell with the fright",-1.45,-5,-11,-7
"1876","i kept my piece in my hand still without firing  being willing to keep my charge ready  because i had given the spaniard my pistol and sword  so i called to friday  and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired  and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged  which he did with great swiftness  and then giving him my musket  i sat down myself to load all the rest again  and bade them come to me when they wanted",1.65,4,-1,2
"1877","while i was loading these pieces  there happened a fierce engagement between the spaniard and one of the savages  who made at him with one of their great wooden swords  the weapon that was to have killed him before  if i had not prevented it",-1.25,-2,-1,-1
"1878","the spaniard  who was as bold and brave as could be imagined  though weak  had fought the indian a good while  and had cut two great wounds on his head  but the savage being a stout  lusty fellow  closing in with him  had thrown him down  being faint  and was wringing my sword out of his hand  when the spaniard  though undermost  wisely quitting the sword  drew the pistol from his girdle  shot the savage through the body  and killed him upon the spot  before i  who was running to help him  could come near him",-1.45,-1,8,0
"1879","friday  being now left to his liberty  pursued the flying wretches  with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet  and with that he despatched those three who as i said before  were wounded at first  and fallen  and all the rest he could come up with  and the spaniard coming to me for a gun  i gave him one of the fowling pieces  with which he pursued two of the savages  and wounded them both  but as he was not able to run  they both got from him into the wood  where friday pursued them  and killed one of them  but the other was too nimble for him  and though he was wounded  yet had plunged himself into the sea  and swam with all his might off to those two who were left in the canoe  which three in the canoe  with one wounded  that we knew not whether he died or no  were all that escaped our hands of one and twenty",-2.25,-2,-10,3
"1880","the account of the whole is as follows  three killed at our first shot from the tree  two killed at the next shot  two killed by friday in the boat  two killed by friday of those at first wounded  one killed by friday in the wood  three killed by the spaniard  four killed  being found dropped here and there  of the wounds  or killed by friday in his chase of them  four escaped in the boat  whereof one wounded  if not dead twenty one in all",-2.3,-3,-7,0
"1881","those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun shot  and though friday made two or three shots at them  i did not find that he hit any of them",-1.15,0,-2,-3
"1882","friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes  and pursue them  and indeed i was very anxious about their escape  lest  carrying the news home to their people  they should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by mere multitude  so i consented to pursue them by sea  and running to one of their canoes  i jumped in and bade friday follow me  but when i was in the canoe i was surprised to find another poor creature lie there  bound hand and foot  as the spaniard was  for the slaughter  and almost dead with fear  not knowing what was the matter  for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat  he was tied so hard neck and heels  and had been tied so long that he had really but little life in him",-5.05,-7,-10,-4
"1883","i immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him with  and would have helped him up  but he could not stand or speak  but groaned most piteously  believing  it seems  still  that he was only unbound in order to be killed",-0.7,0,-6,0
"1884","when friday came to him i bade him speak to him  and tell him of his deliverance  and pulling out my bottle  made him give the poor wretch a dram  which  with the news of his being delivered  revived him  and he sat up in the boat",-0.6,-2,-2,0
"1885","but when friday came to hear him speak  and look in his face  it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how friday kissed him  embraced him  hugged him  cried  laughed  hallooed  jumped about  danced  sang  then cried again  wrung his hands  beat his own face and head  and then sang and jumped about again like a distracted creature",-1.5,1,-3,-2
"1886","it was a good while before i could make him speak to me or tell me what was the matter  but when he came a little to himself he told me that it was his father",0.75,1,4,1
"1887","it is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father  and of his being delivered from death  nor indeed can i describe half the extravagances of his affection after this  for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great many times  when he went in to him he would sit down by him  open his breast  and hold his father s head close to his bosom for many minutes together  to nourish it  then he took his arms and ankles  which were numbed and stiff with the binding  and chafed and rubbed them with his hands  and i  perceiving what the case was  gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with  which did them a great deal of good",2.9,3,6,0
"1888","this affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages  who were now almost out of sight  and it was happy for us that we did not  for it blew so hard within two hours after  and before they could be got a quarter of their way  and continued blowing so hard all night  and that from the north west  which was against them  that i could not suppose their boat could live  or that they ever reached their own coast",-0.3,-1,3,2
"1889","but to return to friday  he was so busy about his father that i could not find in my heart to take him off for some time  but after i thought he could leave him a little  i called him to me  and he came jumping and laughing  and pleased to the highest extreme  then i asked him if he had given his father any bread",1.1,1,3,1
"1890","he shook his head  and said  none  ugly dog eat all up self",-0.15,-1,-3,0
"1891","i then gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch i carried on purpose  i also gave him a dram for himself  but he would not taste it  but carried it to his father",0,0,0,0
"1892","i had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins  so i gave him a handful of them for his father",0,0,0,0
"1893","he had no sooner given his father these raisins but i saw him come out of the boat  and run away as if he had been bewitched  for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that ever i saw  i say  he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight  as it were  in an instant  and though i called  and hallooed out too after him  it was all one away he went  and in a quarter of an hour i saw him come back again  though not so fast as he went  and as he came nearer i found his pace slacker  because he had something in his hand",1,1,-1,2
"1894","when he came up to me i found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot  to bring his father some fresh water  and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread  the bread he gave me  but the water he carried to his father  however  as i was very thirsty too  i took a little of it",0.85,1,1,0
"1895","the water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits i had given him  for he was fainting with thirst",-0.5,-1,0,0
"1896","when his father had drunk  i called to him to know if there was any water left",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"1897","he said  yes   and i bade him give it to the poor spaniard  who was in as much want of it as his father  and i sent one of the cakes that friday brought to the spaniard too  who was indeed very weak  and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree  and whose limbs were also very stiff  and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with",-1.7,-5,-4,1
"1898","when i saw that upon friday s coming to him with the water he sat up and drank  and took the bread and began to eat  i went to him and gave him a handful of raisins",0.6,0,0,1
"1899","he looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance  but was so weak  notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight  that he could not stand up upon his feet he tried to do it two or three times  but was really not able  his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him  so i bade him sit still  and caused friday to rub his ankles  and bathe them with rum  as he had done his father s",-1.25,-2,-5,-1
"1900","i observed the poor affectionate creature  every two minutes  or perhaps less  all the while he was here  turn his head about to see if his father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting  and at last he found he was not to be seen  at which he started up  and  without speaking a word  flew with that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went  but when he came  he only found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs  so friday came back to me presently  and then i spoke to the spaniard to let friday help him up if he could  and lead him to the boat  and then he should carry him to our dwelling  where i would take care of him",2.65,2,7,2
"1901","but friday  a lusty  strong fellow  took the spaniard upon his back  and carried him away to the boat  and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe  with his feet in the inside of it  and then lifting him quite in  he set him close to his father  and presently stepping out again  launched the boat off  and paddled it along the shore faster than i could walk  though the wind blew pretty hard too  so he brought them both safe into our creek  and leaving them in the boat  ran away to fetch the other canoe",3,3,4,3
"1902","as he passed me i spoke to him  and asked him whither he went",0,0,0,-1
"1903","he told me  go fetch more boat  so away he went like the wind  for sure never man or horse ran like him  and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as i got to it by land  so he wafted me over  and then went to help our new guests out of the boat  which he did  but they were neither of them able to walk  so that poor friday knew not what to do",0.8,0,2,1
"1904","to remedy this  i went to work in my thought  and calling to friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me  i soon made a kind of hand barrow to lay them on  and friday and i carried them both up together upon it between us",1,2,2,2
"1905","but when we got them to the outside of our wall  or fortification  we were at a worse loss than before  for it was impossible to get them over  and i was resolved not to break it down  so i set to work again  and friday and i  in about two hours time  made a very handsome tent  covered with old sails  and above that with boughs of trees  being in the space without our outward fence and between that and the grove of young wood which i had planted  and here we made them two beds of such things as i had viz  of good rice straw  with blankets laid upon it to lie on  and another to cover them  on each bed",0.25,-2,2,-1

"1911","but this is by the way",0,0,0,0
"1912","as soon as i had secured my two weak  rescued prisoners  and given them shelter  and a place to rest them upon  i began to think of making some provision for them  and the first thing i did  i ordered friday to take a yearling goat  betwixt a kid and a goat  out of my particular flock  to be killed  when i cut off the hinder quarter  and chopping it into small pieces  i set friday to work to boiling and stewing  and made them a very good dish  i assure you  of flesh and broth  and as i cooked it without doors  for i made no fire within my inner wall  so i carried it all into the new tent  and having set a table there for them  i sat down  and ate my own dinner also with them  and  as well as i could  cheered them and encouraged them",4.5,0,-2,3

"1914","after we had dined  or rather supped  i ordered friday to take one of the canoes  and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms  which  for want of time  we had left upon the place of battle  and the next day i ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages  which lay open to the sun  and would presently be offensive",-3,-3,-5,-2

"1917","his first opinion was  that the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night they went off  but must of necessity be drowned  or driven south to those other shores  where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away  but  as to what they would do if they came safe on shore  he said he knew not  but it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked  the noise  and the fire  that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning  not by the hand of man  and that the two which appeared viz",-4.45,-3,-9,-3

"1919","this  he said  he knew  because he heard them all cry out so  in their language  one to another  for it was impossible for them to conceive that a man could dart fire  and speak thunder  and kill at a distance  without lifting up the hand  as was done now  and this old savage was in the right  for  as i understood since  by other hands  the savages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards  they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men  for it seems they did escape the sea   that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods",-3.95,-3,-11,-3
"1920","this  however  i knew not  and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while  and kept always upon my guard  with all my army  for  as there were now four of us  i would have ventured upon a hundred of them  fairly in the open field  at any time",0,1,3,3
"1921","in a little time  however  no more canoes appearing  the fear of their coming wore off  and i began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration  being likewise assured by friday s father that i might depend upon good usage from their nation  on his account  if i would go",1.45,0,0,2
"1922","but my thoughts were a little suspended when i had a serious discourse with the spaniard  and when i understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen and portuguese  who having been cast away and made their escape to that side  lived there at peace  indeed  with the savages  but were very sore put to it for necessaries  and  indeed  for life",-2.1,-1,-1,0
"1923","i asked him all the particulars of their voyage  and found they were a spanish ship  bound from the rio de la plata to the havanna  being directed to leave their loading there  which was chiefly hides and silver  and to bring back what european goods they could meet with there  that they had five portuguese seamen on board  whom they took out of another wreck  that five of their own men were drowned when first the ship was lost  and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards  and arrived  almost starved  on the cannibal coast  where they expected to have been devoured every moment",-2.6,-3,-11,-2
"1924","he told me they had some arms with them  but they were perfectly useless  for that they had neither powder nor ball  the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little  which they used at their first landing to provide themselves with some food",0.35,-1,-1,2
"1925","i asked him what he thought would become of them there  and if they had formed any design of making their escape",-0.25,0,-1,0
"1926","he said they had many consultations about it  but that having neither vessel nor tools to build one  nor provisions of any kind  their councils always ended in tears and despair",-0.95,-1,-3,1
"1927","i asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me  which might tend towards an escape  and whether  if they were all here  it might not be done",-0.25,0,-1,0
"1928","i told him with freedom  i feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me  if i put my life in their hands  for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man  nor did men always square their dealings by the obligations they had received so much as they did by the advantages they expected",2.35,3,1,2
"1929","i told him it would be very hard that i should be made the instrument of their deliverance  and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in new spain  where an englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice  what necessity or what accident soever brought him thither  and that i had rather be delivered up to the savages  and be devoured alive  than fall into the merciless claws of the priests  and be carried into the inquisition",-1.55,-5,-5,-2
"1930","i added that  otherwise  i was persuaded  if they were all here  we might  with so many hands  build a barque large enough to carry us all away  either to the brazils southward  or to the islands or spanish coast northward  but that if  in requital  they should  when i had put weapons into their hands  carry me by force among their own people  i might be ill used for my kindness to them  and make my case worse than it was before",-0.9,1,-3,-1
"1931","he answered  with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness  that their condition was so miserable  and that they were so sensible of it  that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance  and that  if i pleased  he would go to them with the old man  and discourse with them about it  and return again and bring me their answer  that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath  that they should be absolutely under my direction as their commander and captain  and they should swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me  and go to such christian country as i should agree to  and no other  and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as i intended  and that he would bring a contract from them  under their hands  for that purpose",2.65,2,0,11
"1932","then he told me he would first swear to me himself that he would never stir from me as long as he lived till i gave him orders  and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood  if there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen",-0.85,0,-4,1
"1933","he told me they were all of them very civil  honest men  and they were under the greatest distress imaginable  having neither weapons nor clothes  nor any food  but at the mercy and discretion of the savages  out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country  and that he was sure  if i would undertake their relief  they would live and die by me",2.4,1,4,4
"1934","upon these assurances  i resolved to venture to relieve them  if possible  and to send the old savage and this spaniard over to them to treat",1.9,0,3,-1
"1935","but when we had got all things in readiness to go  the spaniard himself started an objection  which had so much prudence in it on one hand  and so much sincerity on the other hand  that i could not but be very well satisfied in it  and  by his advice  put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year",4.45,3,6,4
"1936","the case was thus  he had been with us now about a month  during which time i had let him see in what manner i had provided  with the assistance of providence  for my support  and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice i had laid up  which  though it was more than sufficient for myself  yet it was not sufficient  without good husbandry  for my family  now it was increased to four  but much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen  who were  as he said  sixteen  still alive  should come over  and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel  if we should build one  for a voyage to any of the christian colonies of america  so he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some more land  as much as i could spare seed to sow  and that we should wait another harvest  that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen  when they should come  for want might be a temptation to them to disagree  or not to think themselves delivered  otherwise than out of one difficulty into another",5.2,1,7,5
"1937","you know  says he  the children of israel  though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of egypt  yet rebelled even against god himself  that delivered them  when they came to want bread in the wilderness",1,0,6,1
"1938","his caution was so seasonable  and his advice so good  that i could not but be very well pleased with his proposal  as well as i was satisfied with his fidelity  so we fell to digging  all four of us  as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted  and in about a month s time  by the end of which it was seed time  we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty bushels of barley on  and sixteen jars of rice  which was  in short  all the seed we had to spare  indeed  we left ourselves barely sufficient  for our own food for the six months that we had to expect our crop  that is to say reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for sowing  for it is not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country",4.6,5,8,5
"1939","having now society enough  and our numbers being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages  if they had come  unless their number had been very great  we went freely all over the island  whenever we found occasion  and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts  it was impossible  at least for me  to have the means of it out of mine",0.75,0,0,2
"1940","for this purpose i marked out several trees  which i thought fit for our work  and i set friday and his father to cut them down  and then i caused the spaniard  to whom i imparted my thoughts on that affair  to oversee and direct their work",0.4,1,0,1
"1941","i showed them with what indefatigable pains i had hewed a large tree into single planks  and i caused them to do the like  till they made about a dozen large planks  of good oak  near two feet broad  thirty five feet long  and from two inches to four inches thick  what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine",1,2,5,3
"1942","at the same time i contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as much as i could  and for this purpose i made friday and the spaniard go out one day  and myself with friday the next day  for we took our turns   and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest  for whenever we shot the dam  we saved the kids  and added them to our flock",1.05,-1,3,2
"1943","but above all  the season for curing the grapes coming on  i caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun  that  i believe  had we been at alicant  where the raisins of the sun are cured  we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels  and these  with our bread  formed a great part of our food very good living too  i assure you  for they are exceedingly nourishing",4.95,5,6,4
"1944","it was now harvest  and our crop in good order  it was not the most plentiful increase i had seen in the island  but  however  it was enough to answer our end  for from twenty two bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels  and the like in proportion of the rice  which was store enough for our food to the next harvest  though all the sixteen spaniards had been on shore with me  or  if we had been ready for a voyage  it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world  that is to say  any part of america",3.55,5,6,6
"1945","when we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn  we fell to work to make more wicker ware  viz  great baskets  in which we kept it  and the spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part  and often blamed me that i did not make some things for defence of this kind of work  but i saw no need of it",1.95,3,4,0
"1946","and now  having a full supply of food for all the guests i expected  i gave the spaniard leave to go over to the main  to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there",0.55,0,-1,3
"1947","i gave him a strict charge not to bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself and the old savage that he would in no way injure  fight with  or attack the person he should find in the island  who was so kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance  but that they would stand by him and defend him against all such attempts  and wherever they went would be entirely under and subjected to his command  and that this should be put in writing  and signed in their hands",-1.7,-5,-3,0
"1948","how they were to have done this  when i knew they had neither pen nor ink  was a question which we never asked",0,0,0,1
"1949","under these instructions  the spaniard and the old savage  the father of friday  went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to have come in  or rather were brought in  when they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages",-2.7,-2,-2,-1
"1950","i gave each of them a musket  with a firelock on it  and about eight charges of powder and ball  charging them to be very good husbands of both  and not to use either of them but upon urgent occasions",0,0,0,0
"1951","this was a cheerful work  being the first measures used by me in view of my deliverance for now twenty seven years and some days",1.4,2,2,2
"1952","i gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes  sufficient for themselves for many days  and sufficient for all the spaniards for about eight days time  and wishing them a good voyage  i saw them go  agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out at their return  by which i should know them again when they came back  at a distance  before they came on shore",3.3,1,4,2
"1953","they went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at full  by my account in the month of october  but as for an exact reckoning of days  after i had once lost it i could never recover it again  nor had i kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure i was right  though  as it proved when i afterwards examined my account  i found i had kept a true reckoning of years",2.9,2,1,3
"1954","it was no less than eight days i had waited for them  when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened  of which the like has not  perhaps  been heard of in history",-1.3,-1,-2,-1
"1955","i was fast asleep in my hutch one morning  when my man friday came running in to me  and called aloud  master  master  they are come  they are come",0,2,0,1
"1956","i jumped up  and regardless of danger i went  as soon as i could get my clothes on  through my little grove  which  by the way  was by this time grown to be a very thick wood  i say  regardless of danger i went without my arms  which was not my custom to do  but i was surprised when  turning my eyes to the sea  i presently saw a boat at about a league and a half distance  standing in for the shore  with a shoulder of mutton sail  as they call it  and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in  also i observed  presently  that they did not come from that side which the shore lay on  but from the southernmost end of the island",1,1,1,5
"1957","upon this i called friday in  and bade him lie close  for these were not the people we looked for  and that we might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies",-1,-2,-2,-1
"1958","in the next place i went in to fetch my perspective glass to see what i could make of them  and having taken the ladder out  i climbed up to the top of the hill  as i used to do when i was apprehensive of anything  and to take my view the plainer without being discovered",-0.75,0,0,0
"1959","i had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my eye plainly discovered a ship lying at anchor  at about two leagues and a half distance from me  sse",-1,-2,0,-1
"1960","but not above a league and a half from the shore",0.25,0,0,1
"1961","by my observation it appeared plainly to be an english ship  and the boat appeared to be an english long boat",0,0,0,0
"1962","i cannot express the confusion i was in  though the joy of seeing a ship  and one that i had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen  and consequently friends  was such as i cannot describe  but yet i had some secret doubts hung about me i cannot tell from whence they came bidding me keep upon my guard",0.1,-2,2,2
"1963","in the first place  it occurred to me to consider what business an english ship could have in that part of the world  since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the english had any traffic  and i knew there had been no storms to drive them in there in distress  and that if they were really english it was most probable that they were here upon no good design  and that i had better continue as i was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers",-0.3,0,2,0
"1964","let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being real",-1.25,-2,-3,-1
"1965","that such hints and notices are given us i believe few that have made any observation of things can deny  that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world  and a converse of spirits  we cannot doubt  and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger  why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent  whether supreme  or inferior and subordinate  is not the question   and that they are given for our good",-1.2,-3,1,-1
"1966","the present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this reasoning  for had i not been made cautious by this secret admonition  come it from whence it will  i had been done inevitably  and in a far worse condition than before  as you will see presently",-0.5,-3,-2,2
"1967","i had not kept myself long in this posture till i saw the boat draw near the shore  as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at  for the convenience of landing  however  as they did not come quite far enough  they did not see the little inlet where i formerly landed my rafts  but ran their boat on shore upon the beach  at about half a mile from me  which was very happy for me  for otherwise they would have landed just at my door  as i may say  and would soon have beaten me out of my castle  and perhaps have plundered me of all i had",0,3,1,3
"1968","when they were on shore i was fully satisfied they were englishmen  at least most of them  one or two i thought were dutch  but it did not prove so  there were in all eleven men  whereof three of them i found were unarmed and  as i thought  bound  and when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore  they took those three out of the boat as prisoners  one of the three i could perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty  affliction  and despair  even to a kind of extravagance  the other two  i could perceive  lifted up their hands sometimes  and appeared concerned indeed  but not to such a degree as the first",1.1,-2,-1,5
"1969","i was perfectly confounded at the sight  and knew not what the meaning of it should be",0,0,3,-1
"1970","friday called out to me in english  as well as he could  o master  you see english mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans",0.15,0,-2,0
"1971","why  friday  says i  do you think they are going to eat them  then",0.6,0,0,1
"1972","yes  says friday  they will eat them",1.4,0,1,1
"1973","no no  says i  friday  i am afraid they will murder them  indeed  but you may be sure they will not eat them",-0.9,-2,-5,-1
"1974","all this while i had no thought of what the matter really was  but stood trembling with the horror of the sight  expecting every moment when the three prisoners should be killed  nay  once i saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass  as the seamen call it  or sword  to strike one of the poor men  and i expected to see him fall every moment  at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins",-4.9,-5,-7,-5
"1975","i wished heartily now for the spaniard  and the savage that had gone with him  or that i had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them  that i might have secured the three men  for i saw no firearms they had among them  but it fell out to my mind another way",-0.7,-1,1,-3
"1976","after i had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen  i observed the fellows run scattering about the island  as if they wanted to see the country",-1.3,-2,-3,-1
"1977","i observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased  but they sat down all three upon the ground  very pensive  and looked like men in despair",0.75,2,1,1
"1978","this put me in mind of the first time when i came on shore  and began to look about me  how i gave myself over for lost  how wildly i looked round me  what dreadful apprehensions i had  and how i lodged in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts",-3.9,-6,-8,-3
"1979","as i knew nothing that night of the supply i was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tide  by which i have since been so long nourished and supported  so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were  how near it was to them  and how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety  at the same time that they thought themselves lost and their case desperate",0.25,-3,-4,1
"1980","so little do we see before us in the world  and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great maker of the world  that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute  but that in the worst circumstances they have always something to be thankful for  and sometimes are nearer deliverance than they imagine  nay  are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction",1,-1,0,-1
"1981","it was just at high water when these people came on shore  and while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in  they had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent  and the water was ebbed considerably away  leaving their boat aground",-0.25,-1,2,-1
"1982","they had left two men in the boat  who  as i found afterwards  having drunk a little too much brandy  fell asleep  however  one of them waking a little sooner than the other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it  hallooed out for the rest  who were straggling about  upon which they all soon came to the boat  but it was past all their strength to launch her  the boat being very heavy  and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand  almost like a quicksand",0.6,0,2,1
"1983","in this condition  like true seamen  who are  perhaps  the least of all mankind given to forethought  they gave it over  and away they strolled about the country again  and i heard one of them say aloud to another  calling them off from the boat  why  let her alone  jack  can t you",1.2,1,2,1
"1984","she ll float next tide  by which i was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were",1.3,0,0,4
"1985","all this while i kept myself very close  not once daring to stir out of my castle any farther than to my place of observation near the top of the hill  and very glad i was to think how well it was fortified",2.3,4,7,3
"1986","i knew it was no less than ten hours before the boat could float again  and by that time it would be dark  and i might be at more liberty to see their motions  and to hear their discourse  if they had any",-0.1,0,-1,1
"1987","in the meantime i fitted myself up for a battle as before  though with more caution  knowing i had to do with another kind of enemy than i had at first",-0.25,-1,-1,-1
"1988","i ordered friday also  whom i had made an excellent marksman with his gun  to load himself with arms",0.5,1,2,0

"1990","my figure  indeed  was very fierce  i had my formidable goat skin coat on  with the great cap i have mentioned  a naked sword by my side  two pistols in my belt  and a gun upon each shoulder",-1.1,1,2,-2
"1991","it was my design  as i said above  not to have made any attempt till it was dark  but about two o clock  being the heat of the day  i found that they were all gone straggling into the woods  and  as i thought  laid down to sleep",0,-1,0,1
"1992","the three poor distressed men  too anxious for their condition to get any sleep  had  however  sat down under the shelter of a great tree  at about a quarter of a mile from me  and  as i thought  out of sight of any of the rest",-1.35,-2,-3,1
"1993","upon this i resolved to discover myself to them  and learn something of their condition  immediately i marched as above  my man friday at a good distance behind me  as formidable for his arms as i  but not making quite so staring a spectre like figure as i did",1.8,3,7,1
"1994","i came as near them undiscovered as i could  and then  before any of them saw me  i called aloud to them in spanish  what are ye  gentlemen",0,0,0,0

"2025","he said  very modestly  that he was loath to kill them if he could help it  but that those two were incorrigible villains  and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship  and if they escaped  we should be undone still  for they would go on board and bring the whole ship s company  and destroy us all",-4.65,-6,-4,-3
"2026","well  then  says i  necessity legitimates my advice  for it is the only way to save our lives",1.3,1,2,1
"2027","however  seeing him still cautious of shedding blood  i told him they should go themselves  and manage as they found convenient",1.8,1,-1,4
"2028","in the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake  and soon after we saw two of them on their feet",0,0,0,0
"2029","i asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny",-1,0,0,-1
"2030","he said  no",0,0,-1,0
"2031","well  then  said i  you may let them escape  and providence seems to have awakened them on purpose to save themselves",1.4,2,1,1
"2032","now  says i  if the rest escape you  it is your fault",-0.75,-1,-1,0
"2033","animated with this  he took the musket i had given him in his hand  and a pistol in his belt  and his two comrades with him  with each a piece in his hand  the two men who were with him going first made some noise  at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about  and seeing them coming  cried out to the rest  but was too late then  for the moment he cried out they fired i mean the two men  the captain wisely reserving his own piece",-1.25,0,-4,-1
"2034","they had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew  that one of them was killed on the spot  and the other very much wounded  but not being dead  he started up on his feet  and called eagerly for help to the other  but the captain stepping to him  told him it was too late to cry for help  he should call upon god to forgive his villainy  and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket  so that he never spoke more  there were three more in the company  and one of them was slightly wounded",-0.8,-1,-3,0
"2035","by this time i was come  and when they saw their danger  and that it was in vain to resist  they begged for mercy",-1.35,-1,0,-1
"2036","the captain told them he would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of  and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship  and afterwards in carrying her back to jamaica  from whence they came",-0.1,0,-2,2
"2037","they gave him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be desired  and he was willing to believe them  and spare their lives  which i was not against  only that i obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on the island",2.35,2,4,0
"2038","while this was doing  i sent friday with the captain s mate to the boat with orders to secure her  and bring away the oars and sails  which they did  and by and by three straggling men  that were  happily for them  parted from the rest  came back upon hearing the guns fired  and seeing the captain  who was before their prisoner  now their conqueror  they submitted to be bound also  and so our victory was complete",0.85,2,1,2
"2039","it now remained that the captain and i should inquire into one another s circumstances",0,0,0,1
"2040","i began first  and told him my whole history  which he heard with an attention even to amazement and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition  and  indeed  as my story is a whole collection of wonders  it affected him deeply",1.8,3,3,2
"2041","but when he reflected from thence upon himself  and how i seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life  the tears ran down his face  and he could not speak a word more",-0.3,0,0,2
"2042","after this communication was at an end  i carried him and his two men into my apartment  leading them in just where i came out  viz  at the top of the house  where i refreshed them with such provisions as i had  and showed them all the contrivances i had made during my long  long inhabiting that place",1.25,3,4,1
"2043","all i showed them  all i said to them  was perfectly amazing  but above all  the captain admired my fortification  and how perfectly i had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees  which having been now planted nearly twenty years  and the trees growing much faster than in england  was become a little wood  so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that one side where i had reserved my little winding passage into it",1.05,2,10,-1
"2044","i told him this was my castle and my residence  but that i had a seat in the country  as most princes have  whither i could retreat upon occasion  and i would show him that too another time  but at present our business was to consider how to recover the ship",0.5,0,-1,1
"2045","he agreed with me as to that  but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take  for that there were still six and twenty hands on board  who  having entered into a cursed conspiracy  by which they had all forfeited their lives to the law  would be hardened in it now by desperation  and would carry it on  knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to england  or to any of the english colonies  and that  therefore  there would be no attacking them with so small a number as we were",-3.8,-5,-4,-5
"2046","i mused for some time on what he had said  and found it was a very rational conclusion  and that therefore something was to be resolved on speedily  as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise as to prevent their landing upon us  and destroying us",2,2,-2,1
"2047","upon this  it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship s crew  wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat  would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them  and that then  perhaps  they might come armed  and be too strong for us  this he allowed to be rational",1,2,2,1
"2048","upon this  i told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach  so that they might not carry her off  and taking everything out of her  leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim",-0.6,-1,-2,-2
"2049","accordingly  we went on board  took the arms which were left on board out of her  and whatever else we found there which was a bottle of brandy  and another of rum  a few biscuit cakes  a horn of powder  and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas  the sugar was five or six pounds   all which was very welcome to me  especially the brandy and sugar  of which i had had none left for many years",1.85,2,5,0
"2050","when we had carried all these things on shore  the oars  mast  sail  and rudder of the boat were carried away before   we knocked a great hole in her bottom  that if they had come strong enough to master us  yet they could not carry off the boat",0.75,4,5,0
"2051","indeed  it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship  but my view was  that if they went away without the boat  i did not much question to make her again fit to carry as to the leeward islands  and call upon our friends the spaniards in my way  for i had them still in my thoughts",1.4,1,1,1
"2052","while we were thus preparing our designs  and had first  by main strength  heaved the boat upon the beach  so high that the tide would not float her off at high water mark  and besides  had broke a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped  and were set down musing what we should do  we heard the ship fire a gun  and make a waft with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board but no boat stirred  and they fired several times  making other signals for the boat",-1.9,-1,-5,0
"2053","at last  when all their signals and firing proved fruitless  and they found the boat did not stir  we saw them  by the help of my glasses  hoist another boat out and row towards the shore  and we found  as they approached  that there were no less than ten men in her  and that they had firearms with them",-1.35,-1,-3,-2
"2054","as the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore  we had a full view of them as they came  and a plain sight even of their faces  because the tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat  they rowed up under shore  to come to the same place where the other had landed  and where the boat lay  by this means  i say  we had a full view of them  and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat  of whom  he said  there were three very honest fellows  who  he was sure  were led into this conspiracy by the rest  being over powered and frightened  but that as for the boatswain  who it seems was the chief officer among them  and all the rest  they were as outrageous as any of the ship s crew  and were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise  and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us",-1.85,-3,-14,3
"2055","i smiled at him  and told him that men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear  that seeing almost every condition that could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in  we ought to expect that the consequence  whether death or life  would be sure to be a deliverance",0.9,-1,0,0
"2056","i asked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life  and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for",1.15,1,2,2
"2057","and where  sir  said i  is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life  which elevated you a little while ago",0.75,0,2,2
"2058","for my part  said i  there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it",-0.4,-1,1,1
"2059","what is that",0,0,0,0
"2060","say he",0,0,0,0
"2061","why  said i  it is  that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them which should be spared  had they been all of the wicked part of the crew i should have thought god s providence had singled them out to deliver them into your hands  for depend upon it  every man that comes ashore is our own  and shall die or live as they behave to us",-0.15,0,-2,0
"2062","as i spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance  i found it greatly encouraged him  so we set vigorously to our business",2.15,1,4,1
"2063","we had  upon the first appearance of the boat s coming from the ship  considered of separating our prisoners  and we had  indeed  secured them effectually",0,0,0,0
"2064","two of them  of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary  i sent with friday  and one of the three delivered men  to my cave  where they were remote enough  and out of danger of being heard or discovered  or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have delivered themselves",-0.2,-1,-2,1
"2065","here they left them bound  but gave them provisions  and promised them  if they continued there quietly  to give them their liberty in a day or two  but that if they attempted their escape they should be put to death without mercy",0.75,2,0,0
"2066","they promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience  and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them  for friday gave them candles  such as we made ourselves  for their comfort  and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance",3.5,6,8,4
"2067","the other prisoners had better usage  two of them were kept pinioned  indeed  because the captain was not able to trust them  but the other two were taken into my service  upon the captain s recommendation  and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us  so with them and the three honest men we were seven men  well armed  and i made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming  considering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men among them also",1.85,5,-2,2
"2068","as soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay  they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore  hauling the boat up after them  which i was glad to see  for i was afraid they would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the shore  with some hands in her to guard her  and so we should not be able to seize the boat",-0.75,0,1,1
"2069","being on shore  the first thing they did  they ran all to their other boat  and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her stripped  as above  of all that was in her  and a great hole in her bottom",1.9,2,4,-1
"2070","after they had mused a while upon this  they set up two or three great shouts  hallooing with all their might  to try if they could make their companions hear  but all was to no purpose",0.5,1,2,0
"2071","then they came all close in a ring  and fired a volley of their small arms  which indeed we heard  and the echoes made the woods ring",-0.5,0,-2,-1
"2072","but it was all one  those in the cave  we were sure  could not hear  and those in our keeping  though they heard it well enough  yet durst give no answer to them",0.55,1,-1,0
"2073","they were so astonished at the surprise of this  that  as they told us afterwards  they resolved to go all on board again to their ship  and let them know that the men were all murdered  and the long boat staved  accordingly  they immediately launched their boat again  and got all of them on board",1.2,1,5,1
"2074","the captain was terribly amazed  and even confounded  at this  believing they would go on board the ship again and set sail  giving their comrades over for lost  and so he should still lose the ship  which he was in hopes we should have recovered  but he was quickly as much frightened the other way",-0.35,-3,-4,-1
"2075","they had not been long put off with the boat  when we perceived them all coming on shore again  but with this new measure in their conduct  which it seems they consulted together upon  viz  to leave three men in the boat  and the rest to go on shore  and go up into the country to look for their fellows",0.55,0,-1,0
"2076","this was a great disappointment to us  for now we were at a loss what to do  as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape  because they would row away to the ship  and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail  and so our recovering the ship would be lost",-1.5,-1,-5,-2
"2077","however we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present",0.25,0,-1,1
"2078","the seven men came on shore  and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore  and came to an anchor to wait for them  so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat",0,0,3,0
"2079","those that came on shore kept close together  marching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay  and we could see them plainly  though they could not perceive us",0,1,2,2
"2080","we should have been very glad if they would have come nearer us  so that we might have fired at them  or that they would have gone farther off  that we might come abroad",0.25,1,1,1
"2081","but when they were come to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods  which lay towards the north east part  and where the island lay lowest  they shouted and hallooed till they were weary  and not caring  it seems  to venture far from the shore  nor far from one another  they sat down together under a tree to consider it",-0.75,0,2,-1
"2082","had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there  as the other part of them had done  they had done the job for us  but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep  though they could not tell what the danger was they had to fear",-2.1,-3,-3,0
"2083","the captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of theirs  viz  that perhaps they would all fire a volley again  to endeavour to make their fellows hear  and that we should all sally upon them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged  and they would certainly yield  and we should have them without bloodshed",-1,-1,-2,0
"2084","i liked this proposal  provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before they could load their pieces again",0.25,2,2,0
"2085","but this event did not happen  and we lay still a long time  very irresolute what course to take",-0.5,-1,-2,0
"2086","at length i told them there would be nothing done  in my opinion  till night  and then  if they did not return to the boat  perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore  and so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore",0,0,0,0
"2087","we waited a great while  though very impatient for their removing  and were very uneasy when  after long consultation  we saw them all start up and march down towards the sea  it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions of the danger of the place that they resolved to go on board the ship again  give their companions over for lost  and so go on with their intended voyage with the ship",-4.4,-5,-7,-2
"2088","as soon as i perceived them go towards the shore  i imagined it to be as it really was that they had given over their search  and were going back again  and the captain  as soon as i told him my thoughts  was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it  but i presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again  and which answered my end to a tittle",-0.45,-1,0,1
"2089","i ordered friday and the captain s mate to go over the little creek westward  towards the place where the savages came on shore  when friday was rescued  and so soon as they came to a little rising round  at about half a mile distant  i bid them halloo out  as loud as they could  and wait till they found the seamen heard them  that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them  they should return it again  and then  keeping out of sight  take a round  always answering when the others hallooed  to draw them as far into the island and among the woods as possible  and then wheel about again to me by such ways as i directed them",0.5,-2,2,3
"2090","they were just going into the boat when friday and the mate hallooed  and they presently heard them  and answering  ran along the shore westward  towards the voice they heard  when they were stopped by the creek  where the water being up  they could not get over  and called for the boat to come up and set them over  as  indeed  i expected",0.2,0,-1,1
"2091","when they had set themselves over  i observed that the boat being gone a good way into the creek  and  as it were  in a harbour within the land  they took one of the three men out of her  to go along with them  and left only two in the boat  having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore",0.75,0,3,3
"2092","this was what i wished for  and immediately leaving friday and the captain s mate to their business  i took the rest with me  and  crossing the creek out of their sight  we surprised the two men before they were aware one of them lying on the shore  and the other being in the boat",0.1,-1,0,2
"2093","the fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking  and going to start up  the captain  who was foremost  ran in upon him  and knocked him down  and then called out to him in the boat to yield  or he was a dead man",-0.2,0,-3,2
"2094","they needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield  when he saw five men upon him and his comrade knocked down  besides  this was  it seems  one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew  and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield  but afterwards to join very sincerely with us",1,1,3,2
"2095","in the meantime  friday and the captain s mate so well managed their business with the rest that they drew them  by hallooing and answering  from one hill to another  and from one wood to another  till they not only heartily tired them  but left them where they were  very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark  and  indeed  they were heartily tired themselves also  by the time they came back to us",0.55,0,-1,3
"2096","we had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark  and to fall upon them  so as to make sure work with them",-0.6,-1,0,-1
"2097","it was several hours after friday came back to me before they came back to their boat  and we could hear the foremost of them  long before they came quite up  calling to those behind to come along  and could also hear them answer  and complain how lame and tired they were  and not able to come any faster  which was very welcome news to us",-0.5,0,-4,-2
"2098","at length they came up to the boat  but it is impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek  the tide ebbed out  and their two men gone",-0.9,-2,0,-2
"2099","we could hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner  telling one another they were got into an enchanted island  that either there were inhabitants in it  and they should all be murdered  or else there were devils and spirits in it  and they should be all carried away and devoured",-2.15,0,2,2
"2100","they hallooed again  and called their two comrades by their names a great many times  but no answer",0.5,1,2,0
"2101","after some time we could see them  by the little light there was  run about  wringing their hands like men in despair  and sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves  then come ashore again  and walk about again  and so the same thing over again",-0.25,0,-1,0
"2102","my men would fain have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark  but i was willing to take them at some advantage  so as to spare them  and kill as few of them as i could  and especially i was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men  knowing the others were very well armed",-0.95,-3,-5,-2
"2103","i resolved to wait  to see if they did not separate  and therefore  to make sure of them  i drew my ambuscade nearer  and ordered friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet  as close to the ground as they could  that they might not be discovered  and get as near them as they could possibly before they offered to fire",-0.65,-1,0,-1
"2104","they had not been long in that posture when the boatswain  who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny  and had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest  came walking towards them  with two more of the crew  the captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so much in his power  that he could hardly have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him  for they only heard his tongue before  but when they came nearer  the captain and friday  starting up on their feet  let fly at them",-0.6,-1,0,3
"2105","the boatswain was killed upon the spot  the next man was shot in the body  and fell just by him  though he did not die till an hour or two after  and the third ran for it",-2.15,-3,-6,-3
"2106","at the noise of the fire i immediately advanced with my whole army  which was now eight men  viz  myself  generalissimo  friday  my lieutenant general  the captain and his two men  and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms",0.1,1,-3,1
"2107","we came upon them  indeed  in the dark  so that they could not see our number  and i made the man they had left in the boat  who was now one of us  to call them by name  to try if i could bring them to a parley  and so perhaps might reduce them to terms  which fell out just as we desired  for indeed it was easy to think  as their condition then was  they would be very willing to capitulate",0.6,-1,2,-1
"2108","so he calls out as loud as he could to one of them  tom smith",-0.25,-1,0,-1
"2109","tom smith",0,0,0,0
"2110","tom smith answered immediately  is that robinson",0,0,0,0
"2111","for it seems he knew the voice",0,0,0,0
"2112","the other answered  ay  ay  for god s sake  tom smith  throw down your arms and yield  or you are all dead men this moment",-1,-1,-2,2
"2113","who must we yield to",0,0,0,0
"2114","where are they",0,0,0,0
"2115","says smith again",0,0,0,0
"2116","here they are  says he  here s our captain and fifty men with him  have been hunting you these two hours  the boatswain is killed  will fry is wounded  and i am a prisoner  and if you do not yield you are all lost",-2.25,-3,-8,-2
"2117","will they give us quarter  then",0,0,0,0
"2118","says tom smith  and we will yield",0,0,0,0
"2119","i ll go and ask  if you promise to yield  said robinson  so he asked the captain  and the captain himself then calls out  you  smith  you know my voice  if you lay down your arms immediately and submit  you shall have your lives  all but will atkins",0.75,1,1,1
"2120","upon this will atkins cried out  for god s sake  captain  give me quarter  what have i done",-1,0,-1,2
"2121","they have all been as bad as i  which  by the way  was not true  for it seems this will atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied  and used him barbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language",-1.5,-3,-1,1
"2122","however  the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion  and trust to the governor s mercy  by which he meant me  for they all called me governor",2.1,2,3,3
"2123","in a word  they all laid down their arms and begged their lives  and i sent the man that had parleyed with them  and two more  who bound them all  and then my great army of fifty men  which  with those three  were in all but eight  came up and seized upon them  and upon their boat  only that i kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state",-0.35,1,3,0
"2124","our next work was to repair the boat  and think of seizing the ship  and as for the captain  now he had leisure to parley with them  he expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him  and upon the further wickedness of their design  and how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress in the end  and perhaps to the gallows",-2.3,-2,-5,-2
"2125","they all appeared very penitent  and begged hard for their lives",-0.25,-1,-1,0
"2126","as for that  he told them they were not his prisoners  but the commander s of the island  that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren  uninhabited island  but it had pleased god so to direct them that it was inhabited  and that the governor was an englishman  that he might hang them all there  if he pleased  but as he had given them all quarter  he supposed he would send them to england  to be dealt with there as justice required  except atkins  whom he was commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death  for that he would be hanged in the morning",0.35,-2,2,3
"2127","though this was all but a fiction of his own  yet it had its desired effect  atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his life  and all the rest begged of him  for god s sake  that they might not be sent to england",-0.7,-3,3,1
"2128","it now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come  and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship  so i retired in the dark from them  that they might not see what kind of a governor they had  and called the captain to me  when i called  at a good distance  one of the men was ordered to speak again  and say to the captain  captain  the commander calls for you  and presently the captain replied  tell his excellency i am just coming",3.1,2,6,2
"2129","this more perfectly amazed them  and they all believed that the commander was just by  with his fifty men",1,2,5,0
"2130","upon the captain coming to me  i told him my project for seizing the ship  which he liked wonderfully well  and resolved to put it in execution the next morning",1.65,3,8,1
"2131","but  in order to execute it with more art  and to be secure of success  i told him we must divide the prisoners  and that he should go and take atkins  and two more of the worst of them  and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay",0.55,0,-1,2
"2132","this was committed to friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain",0.5,0,1,2
"2133","they conveyed them to the cave as to a prison  and it was  indeed  a dismal place  especially to men in their condition",-1.5,-3,-4,-2
"2134","the others i ordered to my bower  as i called it  of which i have given a full description  and as it was fenced in  and they pinioned  the place was secure enough  considering they were upon their behaviour",0.25,2,2,1
"2135","to these in the morning i sent the captain  who was to enter into a parley with them  in a word  to try them  and tell me whether he thought they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship",1,1,1,3
"2136","he talked to them of the injury done him  of the condition they were brought to  and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present action  yet that if they were sent to england they would all be hanged in chains  but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship  he would have the governor s engagement for their pardon",1,1,1,3
"2137","any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in their condition  they fell down on their knees to the captain  and promised  with the deepest imprecations  that they would be faithful to him to the last drop  and that they should owe their lives to him  and would go with him all over the world  that they would own him as a father to them as long as they lived",2.05,2,4,2
"2138","well  says the captain  i must go and tell the governor what you say  and see what i can do to bring him to consent to it",1.6,1,2,1
"2139","so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in  and that he verily believed they would be faithful",1.65,0,3,3
"2140","however  that we might be very secure  i told him he should go back again and choose out those five  and tell them  that they might see he did not want men  that he would take out those five to be his assistants  and that the governor would keep the other two  and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle  my cave   as hostages for the fidelity of those five  and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution  the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore",-0.8,0,2,0
"2141","this looked severe  and convinced them that the governor was in earnest  however  they had no way left them but to accept it  and it was now the business of the prisoners  as much as of the captain  to persuade the other five to do their duty",0.8,0,-1,2
"2142","our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition  first  the captain  his mate  and passenger  second  the two prisoners of the first gang  to whom  having their character from the captain  i had given their liberty  and trusted them with arms  third  the other two that i had kept till now in my bower  pinioned  but on the captain s motion had now released  fourth  these five released at last  so that there were twelve in all  besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages",1.1,1,2,4
"2143","i asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board the ship  but as for me and my man friday  i did not think it was proper for us to stir  having seven men left behind  and it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder  and supply them with victuals",0.45,2,0,3
"2144","as to the five in the cave  i resolved to keep them fast  but friday went in twice a day to them  to supply them with necessaries  and i made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance  where friday was to take them",1.4,0,3,1
"2145","when i showed myself to the two hostages  it was with the captain  who told them i was the person the governor had ordered to look after them  and that it was the governor s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my direction  that if they did  they would be fetched into the castle  and be laid in irons  so that as we never suffered them to see me as governor  i now appeared as another person  and spoke of the governor  the garrison  the castle  and the like  upon all occasions",-0.4,1,3,0
"2146","the captain now had no difficulty before him  but to furnish his two boats  stop the breach of one  and man them",-1.65,-2,-4,-1
"2147","he made his passenger captain of one  with four of the men  and himself  his mate  and five more  went in the other  and they contrived their business very well  for they came up to the ship about midnight",1.15,0,0,2
"2148","as soon as they came within call of the ship  he made robinson hail them  and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat  but that it was a long time before they had found them  and the like  holding them in a chat till they came to the ship s side  when the captain and the mate entering first with their arms  immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the butt end of their muskets  being very faithfully seconded by their men  they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks  and began to fasten the hatches  to keep them down that were below  when the other boat and their men  entering at the forechains  secured the forecastle of the ship  and the scuttle which went down into the cook room  making three men they found there prisoners",2.85,3,4,4
"2149","when this was done  and all safe upon deck  the captain ordered the mate  with three men  to break into the round house  where the new rebel captain lay  who  having taken the alarm  had got up  and with two men and a boy had got firearms in their hands  and when the mate  with a crow  split open the door  the new captain and his men fired boldly among them  and wounded the mate with a musket ball  which broke his arm  and wounded two more of the men  but killed nobody",-1.7,-4,-7,-3
"2150","the mate  calling for help  rushed  however  into the round house  wounded as he was  and  with his pistol  shot the new captain through the head  the bullet entering at his mouth  and came out again behind one of his ears  so that he never spoke a word more  upon which the rest yielded  and the ship was taken effectually  without any more lives lost",-0.15,-1,-1,0
"2151","as soon as the ship was thus secured  the captain ordered seven guns to be fired  which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of his success  which  you may be sure  i was very glad to hear  having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two o clock in the morning",2.3,2,6,4
"2152","having thus heard the signal plainly  i laid me down  and it having been a day of great fatigue to me  i slept very sound  till i was surprised with the noise of a gun  and presently starting up  i heard a man call me by the name of governor",-1,-1,0,-3
"2153","governor  and presently i knew the captain s voice  when  climbing up to the top of the hill  there he stood  and  pointing to the ship  he embraced me in his arms  my dear friend and deliverer  says he  there s your ship  for she is all yours  and so are we  and all that belong to her",1.3,1,5,4
"2154","i cast my eyes to the ship  and there she rode  within little more than half a mile of the shore  for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her  and  the weather being fair  had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little creek  and the tide being up  the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where i had first landed my rafts  and so landed just at my door",0.85,2,2,4
"2155","i was at first ready to sink down with the surprise  for i saw my deliverance  indeed  visibly put into my hands  all things easy  and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither i pleased to go",3.1,2,4,3
"2156","at first  for some time  i was not able to answer him one word  but as he had taken me in his arms i held fast by him  or i should have fallen to the ground",-0.5,0,-2,1
"2157","he perceived the surprise  and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial  which he had brought on purpose for me",0.6,0,0,1
"2158","after i had drunk it  i sat down upon the ground  and though it brought me to myself  yet it was a good while before i could speak a word to him",0.25,0,1,2
"2159","all this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as i  only not under any surprise as i was  and he said a thousand kind and tender things to me  to compose and bring me to myself  but such was the flood of joy in my breast  that it put all my spirits into confusion  at last it broke out into tears  and in a little while after i recovered my speech  i then took my turn  and embraced him as my deliverer  and we rejoiced together",3.05,1,9,5
"2160","i told him i looked upon him as a man sent by heaven to deliver me  and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders  that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of providence governing the world  and an evidence that the eye of an infinite power could search into the remotest corner of the world  and send help to the miserable whenever he pleased",1.75,3,4,1
"2161","i forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to heaven  and what heart could forbear to bless him  who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness  and in such a desolate condition  but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed",2.2,2,3,3
"2162","when we had talked a while  the captain told me he had brought me some little refreshment  such as the ship afforded  and such as the wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of",0.1,1,0,1
"2163","upon this  he called aloud to the boat  and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the governor  and  indeed  it was a present as if i had been one that was not to be carried away with them  but as if i had been to dwell upon the island still",0.25,0,0,1
"2164","first  he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters  six large bottles of madeira wine  the bottles held two quarts each   two pounds of excellent good tobacco  twelve good pieces of the ship s beef  and six pieces of pork  with a bag of peas  and about a hundred weight of biscuit  he also brought me a box of sugar  a box of flour  a bag full of lemons  and two bottles of lime juice  and abundance of other things",2.1,3,6,2
"2165","but besides these  and what was a thousand times more useful to me  he brought me six new clean shirts  six very good neckcloths  two pair of gloves  one pair of shoes  a hat  and one pair of stockings  with a very good suit of clothes of his own  which had been worn but very little  in a word  he clothed me from head to foot",2.7,2,6,2
"2166","it was a very kind and agreeable present  as any one may imagine  to one in my circumstances  but never was anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant  awkward  and uneasy as it was to me to wear such clothes at first",-0.75,-2,-2,0
"2167","after these ceremonies were past  and after all his good things were brought into my little apartment  we began to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we had  for it was worth considering whether we might venture to take them with us or no  especially two of them  whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree  and the captain said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them  and if he did carry them away  it must be in irons  as malefactors  to be delivered over to justice at the first english colony he could come to  and i found that the captain himself was very anxious about it",0.9,0,2,4
"2168","upon this  i told him that  if he desired it  i would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave them upon the island",0.55,0,1,-2
"2169","i should be very glad of that  says the captain  with all my heart",0.75,1,3,2
"2170","well  says i  i will send for them up and talk with them for you",1.2,1,0,1
"2171","so i caused friday and the two hostages  for they were now discharged  their comrades having performed their promise  i say  i caused them to go to the cave  and bring up the five men  pinioned as they were  to the bower  and keep them there till i came",0.75,0,1,1
"2172","after some time  i came thither dressed in my new habit  and now i was called governor again",0.8,0,0,0
"2173","being all met  and the captain with me  i caused the men to be brought before me  and i told them i had got a full account of their villainous behaviour to the captain  and how they had run away with the ship  and were preparing to commit further robberies  but that providence had ensnared them in their own ways  and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others",-1.15,-1,-1,1
"2174","i let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized  that she lay now in the road  and they might see by and by that their new captain had received the reward of his villainy  and that they would see him hanging at the yard arm  that  as to them  i wanted to know what they had to say why i should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact  as by my commission they could not doubt but i had authority so to do",1.05,0,2,2
"2175","one of them answered in the name of the rest  that they had nothing to say but this  that when they were taken the captain promised them their lives  and they humbly implored my mercy",2.1,2,3,4
"2176","but i told them i knew not what mercy to show them  for as for myself  i had resolved to quit the island with all my men  and had taken passage with the captain to go to england  and as for the captain  he could not carry them to england other than as prisoners in irons  to be tried for mutiny and running away with the ship  the consequence of which  they must needs know  would be the gallows  so that i could not tell what was best for them  unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island",-1.55,2,5,-3
"2177","if they desired that  as i had liberty to leave the island  i had some inclination to give them their lives  if they thought they could shift on shore",1.05,1,1,0
"2178","they seemed very thankful for it  and said they would much rather venture to stay there than be carried to england to be hanged",1,1,2,1
"2179","so i left it on that issue",0,-1,0,0
"2180","however  the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it  as if he durst not leave them there",-0.75,-1,-1,-1
"2181","upon this i seemed a little angry with the captain  and told him that they were my prisoners  not his  and that seeing i had offered them so much favour  i would be as good as my word  and that if he did not think fit to consent to it i would set them at liberty  as i found them  and if he did not like it he might take them again if he could catch them",2,3,5,4
"2182","upon this they appeared very thankful  and i accordingly set them at liberty  and bade them retire into the woods  to the place whence they came  and i would leave them some firearms  some ammunition  and some directions how they should live very well if they thought fit",2.1,3,2,0
"2183","upon this i prepared to go on board the ship  but told the captain i would stay that night to prepare my things  and desired him to go on board in the meantime  and keep all right in the ship  and send the boat on shore next day for me  ordering him  at all events  to because the new captain  who was killed  to be hanged at the yard arm  that these men might see him",2.5,0,0,3
"2184","when the captain was gone i sent for the men up to me to my apartment  and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances",0,0,0,1
"2185","i told them i thought they had made a right choice  that if the captain had carried them away they would certainly be hanged",1.2,1,0,2
"2186","i showed them the new captain hanging at the yard arm of the ship  and told them they had nothing less to expect",0.95,0,0,1
"2187","when they had all declared their willingness to stay  i then told them i would let them into the story of my living there  and put them into the way of making it easy to them",1.55,2,3,1
"2188","accordingly  i gave them the whole history of the place  and of my coming to it  showed them my fortifications  the way i made my bread  planted my corn  cured my grapes  and  in a word  all that was necessary to make them easy",1.05,1,1,1
"2189","i told them the story also of the seventeen spaniards that were to be expected  for whom i left a letter  and made them promise to treat them in common with themselves",0.75,1,1,1
"2190","here it may be noted that the captain  who had ink on board  was greatly surprised that i never hit upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water  or of something else  as i had done things much more difficult",-0.15,-1,-1,1
"2191","i left them my firearms viz  five muskets  three fowling pieces  and three swords",-0.6,0,0,-1
"2192","i had above a barrel and a half of powder left  for after the first year or two i used but little  and wasted none",-0.75,-1,-2,-1
"2193","i gave them a description of the way i managed the goats  and directions to milk and fatten them  and to make both butter and cheese",-0.4,0,0,0
"2194","in a word  i gave them every part of my own story  and told them i should prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more  and some garden seeds  which i told them i would have been very glad of",1.2,1,2,4
"2195","also  i gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat  and bade them be sure to sow and increase them",1.1,0,1,3
"2196","having done all this i left them the next day  and went on board the ship",0,0,0,0
"2197","we prepared immediately to sail  but did not weigh that night",0.5,0,1,1
"2198","the next morning early  two of the five men came swimming to the ship s side  and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three  begged to be taken into the ship for god s sake  for they should be murdered  and begged the captain to take them on board  though he hanged them immediately",-2.75,-2,-1,1
"2199","upon this the captain pretended to have no power without me  but after some difficulty  and after their solemn promises of amendment  they were taken on board  and were  some time after  soundly whipped and pickled  after which they proved very honest and quiet fellows",-0.05,2,1,1
"2200","some time after this  the boat was ordered on shore  the tide being up  with the things promised to the men  to which the captain  at my intercession  caused their chests and clothes to be added  which they took  and were very thankful for",1.5,2,3,2
"2201","i also encouraged them  by telling them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in  i would not forget them",0.3,0,1,-1
"2202","when i took leave of this island  i carried on board  for relics  the great goat skin cap i had made  my umbrella  and one of my parrots  also  i forgot not to take the money i formerly mentioned  which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished  and could hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled  as also the money i found in the wreck of the spanish ship",-1.3,-3,-5,-2
"2203","and thus i left the island  the th of december  as i found by the ship s account  in the year   after i had been upon it eight and twenty years  two months  and nineteen days  being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the month that i first made my escape in the long boat from among the moors of sallee",-0.25,0,-1,0
"2204","in this vessel  after a long voyage  i arrived in england the th of june  in the year   having been thirty five years absent",-0.6,0,0,-1
"2205","when i came to england i was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if i had never been known there",0.25,0,3,0
"2206","my benefactor and faithful steward  whom i had left my money in trust with  was alive  but had had great misfortunes in the world  was become a widow the second time  and very low in the world",2.6,4,10,5
"2207","i made her very easy as to what she owed me  assuring her i would give her no trouble  but  on the contrary  in gratitude for her former care and faithfulness to me  i relieved her as my little stock would afford  which at that time would  indeed  allow me to do but little for her  but i assured her i would never forget her former kindness to me  nor did i forget her when i had sufficient to help her  as shall be observed in its proper place",7.3,7,6,3
"2208","i went down afterwards into yorkshire  but my father was dead  and my mother and all the family extinct  except that i found two sisters  and two of the children of one of my brothers  and as i had been long ago given over for dead  there had been no provision made for me  so that  in a word  i found nothing to relieve or assist me  and that the little money i had would not do much for me as to settling in the world",1.5,-1,-3,3
"2209","i met with one piece of gratitude indeed  which i did not expect  and this was  that the master of the ship  whom i had so happily delivered  and by the same means saved the ship and cargo  having given a very handsome account to the owners of the manner how i had saved the lives of the men and the ship  they invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned  and all together made me a very handsome compliment upon the subject  and a present of almost sterling",3.6,4,5,5
"2210","but after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life  and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world  i resolved to go to lisbon  and see if i might not come at some information of the state of my plantation in the brazils  and of what was become of my partner  who  i had reason to suppose  had some years past given me over for dead",1.4,-1,-1,3
"2211","with this view i took shipping for lisbon  where i arrived in april following  my man friday accompanying me very honestly in all these ramblings  and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions",1.5,2,3,0
"2212","when i came to lisbon  i found out  by inquiry  and to my particular satisfaction  my old friend  the captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off the shore of africa",1.4,0,1,5
"2213","he was now grown old  and had left off going to sea  having put his son  who was far from a young man  into his ship  and who still used the brazil trade",0.4,0,0,2
"2214","the old man did not know me  and indeed i hardly knew him",0,0,0,0
"2215","but i soon brought him to my remembrance  and as soon brought myself to his remembrance  when i told him who i was",0,0,0,0
"2216","after some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us  i inquired  you may be sure  after my plantation and my partner",1.55,1,2,2
"2217","the old man told me he had not been in the brazils for about nine years  but that he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living  but the trustees whom i had joined with him to take cognisance of my part were both dead  that  however  he believed i would have a very good account of the improvement of the plantation  for that  upon the general belief of my being cast away and drowned  my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator fiscal  who had appropriated it  in case i never came to claim it  one third to the king  and two thirds to the monastery of st  augustine  to be expended for the benefit of the poor  and for the conversion of the indians to the catholic faith  but that  if i appeared  or any one for me  to claim the inheritance  it would be restored  only that the improvement  or annual production  being distributed to charitable uses  could not be restored  but he assured me that the steward of the king s revenue from lands  and the providore  or steward of the monastery  had taken great care all along that the incumbent  that is to say my partner  gave every year a faithful account of the produce  of which they had duly received my moiety",8,7,12,14
"2218","i asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brought the plantation  and whether he thought it might be worth looking after  or whether  on my going thither  i should meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety",1.8,2,2,1
"2219","he told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved  but this he knew  that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying his part of it  and that  to the best of his remembrance  he had heard that the king s third of my part  which was  it seems  granted away to some other monastery or religious house  amounted to above two hundred moidores a year  that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it  there was no question to be made of that  my partner being alive to witness my title  and my name being also enrolled in the register of the country  also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair  honest people  and very wealthy  and he believed i would not only have their assistance for putting me in possession  but would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account  being the produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust  and before it was given up  as above  which  as he remembered  was for about twelve years",9.55,11,18,14
"2220","i showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account  and inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my effects  when he knew that i had made my will  and had made him  the portuguese captain  my universal heir   c",-1.2,-2,-4,0
"2221","he told me that was true  but that as there was no proof of my being dead  he could not act as executor until some certain account should come of my death  and  besides  he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote  that it was true he had registered my will  and put in his claim  and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive  he would have acted by procuration  and taken possession of the ingenio  so they call the sugar house   and have given his son  who was now at the brazils  orders to do it",0.85,-1,-2,1
"2222","but  says the old man  i have one piece of news to tell you  which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest  and that is  believing you were lost  and all the world believing so also  your partner and trustees did offer to account with me  in your name  for the first six or eight years profits  which i received",2.05,-1,0,5
"2223","there being at that time great disbursements for increasing the works  building an ingenio  and buying slaves  it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced  however  says the old man  i shall give you a true account of what i have received in all  and how i have disposed of it",0.35,1,2,4
"2224","after a few days further conference with this ancient friend  he brought me an account of the first six years income of my plantation  signed by my partner and the merchant trustees  being always delivered in goods  viz  tobacco in roll  and sugar in chests  besides rum  molasses   c",2.2,0,1,2
"2225","which is the consequence of a sugar work  and i found by this account  that every year the income considerably increased  but  as above  the disbursements being large  the sum at first was small  however  the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold  besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of tobacco  which were lost in his ship  he having been shipwrecked coming home to lisbon  about eleven years after my having the place",0.25,1,0,-1
"2226","the good man then began to complain of his misfortunes  and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses  and buy him a share in a new ship",1.1,0,-1,2
"2227","however  my old friend  says he  you shall not want a supply in your necessity  and as soon as my son returns you shall be fully satisfied",2.2,1,4,4
"2228","upon this he pulls out an old pouch  and gives me one hundred and sixty portugal moidores in gold  and giving the writings of his title to the ship  which his son was gone to the brazils in  of which he was quarter part owner  and his son another  he puts them both into my hands for security of the rest",0.75,1,2,4
"2229","i was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this  and remembering what he had done for me  how he had taken me up at sea  and how generously he had used me on all occasions  and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me  i could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me  therefore i asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time  and if it would not straiten him",3.5,3,2,6
"2230","he told me he could not say but it might straiten him a little  but  however  it was my money  and i might want it more than he",0.6,0,1,1
"2231","everything the good man said was full of affection  and i could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke  in short  i took one hundred of the moidores  and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them  then i returned him the rest  and told him if ever i had possession of the plantation i would return the other to him also  as  indeed  i afterwards did   and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son s ship  i would not take it by any means  but that if i wanted the money  i found he was honest enough to pay me  and if i did not  but came to receive what he gave me reason to expect  i would never have a penny more from him",3.3,4,5,8
"2232","when this was past  the old man asked me if he should put me into a method to make my claim to my plantation",0,0,0,0
"2233","i told him i thought to go over to it myself",0,0,0,0
"2234","he said i might do so if i pleased  but that if i did not  there were ways enough to secure my right  and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use  and as there were ships in the river of lisbon just ready to go away to brazil  he made me enter my name in a public register  with his affidavit  affirming  upon oath  that i was alive  and that i was the same person who took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first",4.5,6,10,5
"2235","this being regularly attested by a notary  and a procuration affixed  he directed me to send it  with a letter of his writing  to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place  and then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return",0,0,0,0
"2236","never was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this procuration  for in less than seven months i received a large packet from the survivors of my trustees  the merchants  for whose account i went to sea  in which were the following  particular letters and papers enclosed",0.6,0,0,2
"2237","first  there was the account current of the produce of my farm or plantation  from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old portugal captain  being for six years  the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy four moidores in my favour",1.1,2,3,3
"2238","secondly  there was the account of four years more  while they kept the effects in their hands  before the government claimed the administration  as being the effects of a person not to be found  which they called civil death  and the balance of this  the value of the plantation increasing  amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty six crusadoes  being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores",0.75,-1,-2,1
"2239","thirdly  there was the prior of st  augustine s account  who had received the profits for above fourteen years  but not being able to account for what was disposed of by the hospital  very honestly declared he had eight hundred and seventy two moidores not distributed  which he acknowledged to my account  as to the king s part  that refunded nothing",0.9,1,2,3
"2240","there was a letter of my partner s  congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive  giving me an account how the estate was improved  and what it produced a year  with the particulars of the number of squares  or acres that it contained  how planted  how many slaves there were upon it  and making two and twenty crosses for blessings  told me he had said so many  ave marias  to thank the blessed virgin that i was alive  inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own  and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects if i did not come myself  concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship  and that of his family  and sent me as a present seven fine leopards skins  which he had  it seems  received from africa  by some other ship that he had sent thither  and which  it seems  had made a better voyage than i",9.85,5,14,12
"2241","he sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats  and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined  not quite so large as moidores",1.5,2,5,2
"2242","by the same fleet my two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar  eight hundred rolls of tobacco  and the rest of the whole account in gold",0,1,2,3
"2243","i might well say now  indeed  that the latter end of job was better than the beginning",1.6,2,2,1
"2244","it is impossible to express the flutterings of my very heart when i found all my wealth about me  for as the brazil ships come all in fleets  the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods  and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my hand",1.95,0,4,3
"2245","in a word  i turned pale  and grew sick  and  had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial  i believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature  and i had died upon the spot  nay  after that i continued very ill  and was so some hours  till a physician being sent for  and something of the real because of my illness being known  he ordered me to be let blood  after which i had relief  and grew well  but i verily believe  if i had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits  i should have died",0.95,-1,-6,4
"2246","i was now master  all on a sudden  of above five thousand pounds sterling in money  and had an estate  as i might well call it  in the brazils  of above a thousand pounds a year  as sure as an estate of lands in england  and  in a word  i was in a condition which i scarce knew how to understand  or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it",2.15,2,0,2
"2247","the first thing i did was to recompense my original benefactor  my good old captain  who had been first charitable to me in my distress  kind to me in my beginning  and honest to me at the end",2.25,3,9,5
"2248","i showed him all that was sent to me  i told him that  next to the providence of heaven  which disposed all things  it was owing to him  and that it now lay on me to reward him  which i would do a hundred fold  so i first returned to him the hundred moidores i had received of him  then i sent for a notary  and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four hundred and seventy moidores  which he had acknowledged he owed me  in the fullest and firmest manner possible",2.05,3,4,2
"2249","after which i caused a procuration to be drawn  empowering him to be the receiver of the annual profits of my plantation  and appointing my partner to account with him  and make the returns  by the usual fleets  to him in my name  and by a clause in the end  made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him during his life  out of the effects  and fifty moidores a year to his son after him  for his life  and thus i requited my old man",1.7,0,3,3
"2250","i had now to consider which way to steer my course next  and what to do with the estate that providence had thus put into my hands  and  indeed  i had more care upon my head now than i had in my state of life in the island where i wanted nothing but what i had  and had nothing but what i wanted  whereas i had now a great charge upon me  and my business was how to secure it",2.6,3,7,0
"2251","i had not a cave now to hide my money in  or a place where it might lie without lock or key  till it grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it  on the contrary  i knew not where to put it  or whom to trust with it",-1.5,-3,-2,-2
"2252","my old patron  the captain  indeed  was honest  and that was the only refuge i had",1.85,1,2,3
"2253","in the next place  my interest in the brazils seemed to summon me thither  but now i could not tell how to think of going thither till i had settled my affairs  and left my effects in some safe hands behind me",1,1,2,2
"2254","at first i thought of my old friend the widow  who i knew was honest  and would be just to me  but then she was in years  and but poor  and  for aught i knew  might be in debt  so that  in a word  i had no way but to go back to england myself and take my effects with me",0.3,-1,-2,2
"2255","it was some months  however  before i resolved upon this  and  therefore  as i had rewarded the old captain fully  and to his satisfaction  who had been my former benefactor  so i began to think of the poor widow  whose husband had been my first benefactor  and she  while it was in her power  my faithful steward and instructor",2.9,1,7,6
"2256","so  the first thing i did  i got a merchant in lisbon to write to his correspondent in london  not only to pay a bill  but to go find her out  and carry her  in money  a hundred pounds from me  and to talk with her  and comfort her in her poverty  by telling her she should  if i lived  have a further supply  at the same time i sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds each  they being  though not in want  yet not in very good circumstances  one having been married and left a widow  and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be",2.15,1,6,6
"2257","but among all my relations or acquaintances i could not yet pitch upon one to whom i durst commit the gross of my stock  that i might go away to the brazils  and leave things safe behind me  and this greatly perplexed me",-1.75,-1,-3,-2
"2258","i had once a mind to have gone to the brazils and have settled myself there  for i was  as it were  naturalised to the place  but i had some little scruple in my mind about religion  which insensibly drew me back",0,0,0,0
"2259","however  it was not religion that kept me from going there for the present  and as i had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of the country all the while i was among them  so neither did i yet  only that  now and then  having of late thought more of it than formerly  when i began to think of living and dying among them  i began to regret having professed myself a papist  and thought it might not be the best religion to die with",-0.9,-1,-6,-3
"2260","but  as i have said  this was not the main thing that kept me from going to the brazils  but that really i did not know with whom to leave my effects behind me  so i resolved at last to go to england  where  if i arrived  i concluded that i should make some acquaintance  or find some relations  that would be faithful to me  and  accordingly  i prepared to go to england with all my wealth",2.75,1,8,3
"2261","in order to prepare things for my going home  i first  the brazil fleet being just going away  resolved to give answers suitable to the just and faithful account of things i had from thence  and  first  to the prior of st  augustine i wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings  and the offer of the eight hundred and seventy two moidores which were undisposed of  which i desired might be given  five hundred to the monastery  and three hundred and seventy two to the poor  as the prior should direct  desiring the good padre s prayers for me  and the like",4.45,4,14,8
"2262","i wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees  with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for  as for sending them any present  they were far above having any occasion of it",2.75,1,4,4
"2263","lastly  i wrote to my partner  acknowledging his industry in the improving the plantation  and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works  giving him instructions for his future government of my part  according to the powers i had left with my old patron  to whom i desired him to send whatever became due to me  till he should hear from me more particularly  assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to him  but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life",3.75,3,6,4
"2264","to this i added a very handsome present of some italian silks for his wife and two daughters  for such the captain s son informed me he had  with two pieces of fine english broadcloth  the best i could get in lisbon  five pieces of black baize  and some flanders lace of a good value",2.5,4,11,2
"2265","having thus settled my affairs  sold my cargo  and turned all my effects into good bills of exchange  my next difficulty was which way to go to england  i had been accustomed enough to the sea  and yet i had a strange aversion to go to england by the sea at that time  and yet i could give no reason for it  yet the difficulty increased upon me so much  that though i had once shipped my baggage in order to go  yet i altered my mind  and that not once but two or three times",0.35,-1,2,2
"2266","it is true i had been very unfortunate by sea  and this might be one of the reasons  but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment  two of the ships which i had singled out to go in  i mean more particularly singled out than any other  having put my things on board one of them  and in the other having agreed with the captain  i say two of these ships miscarried",0.75,0,4,3
"2267","one was taken by the algerines  and the other was lost on the start  near torbay  and all the people drowned except three  so that in either of those vessels i had been made miserable",-2.55,-2,-8,-2
"2268","having been thus harassed in my thoughts  my old pilot  to whom i communicated everything  pressed me earnestly not to go by sea  but either to go by land to the groyne  and cross over the bay of biscay to rochelle  from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to paris  and so to calais and dover  or to go up to madrid  and so all the way by land through france",1.45,2,-1,5
"2269","in a word  i was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all  except from calais to dover  that i resolved to travel all the way by land  which  as i was not in haste  and did not value the charge  was by much the pleasanter way  and to make it more so  my old captain brought an english gentleman  the son of a merchant in lisbon  who was willing to travel with me  after which we picked up two more english merchants also  and two young portuguese gentlemen  the last going to paris only  so that in all there were six of us and five servants  the two merchants and the two portuguese  contenting themselves with one servant between two  to save the charge  and as for me  i got an english sailor to travel with me as a servant  besides my man friday  who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant on the road",2.7,0,5,5
"2270","in this manner i set out from lisbon  and our company being very well mounted and armed  we made a little troop  whereof they did me the honour to call me captain  as well because i was the oldest man  as because i had two servants  and  indeed  was the origin of the whole journey",1.2,1,2,2
"2271","as i have troubled you with none of my sea journals  so i shall trouble you now with none of my land journals  but some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey i must not omit",-1.85,-5,-3,1
"2272","when we came to madrid  we  being all of us strangers to spain  were willing to stay some time to see the court of spain  and what was worth observing  but it being the latter part of the summer  we hastened away  and set out from madrid about the middle of october  but when we came to the edge of navarre  we were alarmed  at several towns on the way  with an account that so much snow was falling on the french side of the mountains  that several travellers were obliged to come back to pampeluna  after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on",-0.45,-1,-1,-1
"2273","when we came to pampeluna itself  we found it so indeed  and to me  that had been always used to a hot climate  and to countries where i could scarce bear any clothes on  the cold was insufferable  nor  indeed  was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of old castile  where the weather was not only warm but very hot  and immediately to feel a wind from the pyrenean mountains so very keen  so severely cold  as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes",-2.65,-3,-2,-5
"2274","poor friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered with snow  and felt cold weather  which he had never seen or felt before in his life",-1.5,-2,-4,-2
"2275","to mend the matter  when we came to pampeluna it continued snowing with so much violence and so long  that the people said winter was come before its time  and the roads  which were difficult before  were now quite impassable  for  in a word  the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel  and being not hard frozen  as is the case in the northern countries  there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every step",-2.95,-4,-6,-3
"2276","we stayed no less than twenty days at pampeluna  when  seeing the winter coming on  and no likelihood of its being better  for it was the severest winter all over europe that had been known in the memory of man  i proposed that we should go away to fontarabia  and there take shipping for bordeaux  which was a very little voyage",0.8,1,1,0
"2277","but  while i was considering this  there came in four french gentlemen  who  having been stopped on the french side of the passes  as we were on the spanish  had found out a guide  who  traversing the country near the head of languedoc  had brought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow  for where they met with snow in any quantity  they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses",0.0499999999999999,-1,-2,2
"2278","we sent for this guide  who told us he would undertake to carry us the same way  with no hazard from the snow  provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts  for  he said  in these great snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains  being made ravenous for want of food  the ground being covered with snow",1.7,1,4,0
"2279","we told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were  if he would insure us from a kind of two legged wolves  which we were told we were in most danger from  especially on the french side of the mountains",1.4,1,1,2
"2280","he satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go  so we readily agreed to follow him  as did also twelve other gentlemen with their servants  some french  some spanish  who  as i said  had attempted to go  and were obliged to come back again",1.75,1,2,3
"2281","accordingly  we set out from pampeluna with our guide on the th of november  and indeed i was surprised when  instead of going forward  he came directly back with us on the same road that we came from madrid  about twenty miles  when  having passed two rivers  and come into the plain country  we found ourselves in a warm climate again  where the country was pleasant  and no snow to be seen  but  on a sudden  turning to his left  he approached the mountains another way  and though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful  yet he made so many tours  such meanders  and led us by such winding ways  that we insensibly passed the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow  and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of languedoc and gascony  all green and flourishing  though at a great distance  and we had some rough way to pass still",4.95,4,5,6
"2282","we were a little uneasy  however  when we found it snowed one whole day and a night so fast that we could not travel  but he bid us be easy  we should soon be past it all  we found  indeed  that we began to descend every day  and to come more north than before  and so  depending upon our guide  we went on",0.75,1,-1,1
"2283","it was about two hours before night when  our guide being something before us  and not just in sight  out rushed three monstrous wolves  and after them a bear  from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood  two of the wolves made at the guide  and had he been far before us  he would have been devoured before we could have helped him  one of them fastened upon his horse  and the other attacked the man with such violence  that he had not time  or presence of mind enough  to draw his pistol  but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily",-2.75,0,-7,-1
"2284","my man friday being next me  i bade him ride up and see what was the matter",0,0,1,0
"2285","as soon as friday came in sight of the man  he hallooed out as loud as the other  o master",-0.25,0,0,1
"2286","o master  but like a bold fellow  rode directly up to the poor man  and with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him",-1.4,1,1,1
"2287","it was happy for the poor man that it was my man friday  for  having been used to such creatures in his country  he had no fear upon him  but went close up to him and shot him  whereas  any other of us would have fired at a farther distance  and have perhaps either missed the wolf or endangered shooting the man",-3.75,-2,-6,-3
"2288","but it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than i  and  indeed  it alarmed all our company  when  with the noise of friday s pistol  we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves  and the noise  redoubled by the echo of the mountains  appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious number of them  and perhaps there was not such a few as that we had no because of apprehension  however  as friday had killed this wolf  the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately  and fled  without doing him any damage  having happily fastened upon his head  where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth",-5.45,-4,-16,-3
"2289","but the man was most hurt  for the raging creature had bit him twice  once in the arm  and the other time a little above his knee  and though he had made some defence  he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his horse  when friday came up and shot the wolf",-3.3,-3,-4,-5
"2290","it is easy to suppose that at the noise of friday s pistol we all mended our pace  and rode up as fast as the way  which was very difficult  would give us leave  to see what was the matter",-0.35,0,0,-3
"2291","as soon as we came clear of the trees  which blinded us before  we saw clearly what had been the case  and how friday had disengaged the poor guide  though we did not presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed",-0.15,0,-1,-1
"2292","but never was a fight managed so hardily  and in such a surprising manner as that which followed between friday and the bear  which gave us all  though at first we were surprised and afraid for him  the greatest diversion imaginable",-1,0,0,-1
"2293","as the bear is a heavy  clumsy creature  and does not gallop as the wolf does  who is swift and light  so he has two particular qualities  which generally are the rule of his actions  first  as to men  who are not his proper prey  he does not usually attempt them  except they first attack him  unless he be excessively hungry  which it is probable might now be the case  the ground being covered with snow   if you do not meddle with him  he will not meddle with you  but then you must take care to be very civil to him  and give him the road  for he is a very nice gentleman  he will not go a step out of his way for a prince  nay  if you are really afraid  your best way is to look another way and keep going on  for sometimes if you stop  and stand still  and look steadfastly at him  he takes it for an affront  but if you throw or toss anything at him  though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger  he thinks himself abused  and sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge  and will have satisfaction in point of honour that is his first quality  the next is  if he be once affronted  he will never leave you  night or day  till he has his revenge  but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes you",-2.3,-1,9,-6
"2294","my man friday had delivered our guide  and when we came up to him he was helping him off his horse  for the man was both hurt and frightened  when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood  and a monstrous one it was  the biggest by far that ever i saw",-0.65,-1,-2,-1
"2295","we were all a little surprised when we saw him  but when friday saw him  it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow s countenance",2.7,3,6,3
"2296","o  says friday  three times  pointing to him  o master  you give me te leave  me shakee te hand with him  me makee you good laugh",1,2,3,2
"2297","i was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased",1.95,2,3,2
"2298","you fool  says i  he will eat you up",-0.15,-1,-2,0
"2299","eatee me up  eatee me up  says friday  twice over again  me eatee him up  me makee you good laugh  you all stay here  me show you good laugh",1.25,1,4,2
"2300","so down he sits  and gets off his boots in a moment  and puts on a pair of pumps  as we call the flat shoes they wear  and which he had in his pocket   gives my other servant his horse  and with his gun away he flew  swift like the wind",0.75,2,3,-2
"2301","the bear was walking softly on  and offered to meddle with nobody  till friday coming pretty near  calls to him  as if the bear could understand him",0.25,0,1,-1
"2302","hark ye  hark ye  says friday  me speakee with you",0,0,0,0
"2303","we followed at a distance  for now being down on the gascony side of the mountains  we were entered a vast forest  where the country was plain and pretty open  though it had many trees in it scattered here and there",0.75,1,1,1
"2304","friday  who had  as we say  the heels of the bear  came up with him quickly  and took up a great stone  and threw it at him  and hit him just on the head  but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall  but it answered friday s end  for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him  and show us some laugh as he called it",-1.15,-2,-1,-3
"2305","as soon as the bear felt the blow  and saw him  he turns about and comes after him  taking very long strides  and shuffling on at a strange rate  so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop  away runs friday  and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help  so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear  and deliver my man  though i was angry at him for bringing the bear back upon us  when he was going about his own business another way  and especially i was angry that he had turned the bear upon us  and then ran away  and i called out  you dog  is this your making us laugh",-0.8,-3,-1,0
"2306","come away  and take your horse  that we may shoot the creature",-0.75,0,-1,-2
"2307","he heard me  and cried out  no shoot  no shoot  stand still  and you get much laugh  and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear s one  he turned on a sudden on one side of us  and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose  he beckoned to us to follow  and doubling his pace  he got nimbly up the tree  laying his gun down upon the ground  at about five or six yards from the bottom of the tree",0.05,3,0,-1
"2308","the bear soon came to the tree  and we followed at a distance  the first thing he did he stopped at the gun  smelt at it  but let it lie  and up he scrambles into the tree  climbing like a cat  though so monstrous heavy",-1.65,-3,0,-1
"2309","i was amazed at the folly  as i thought it  of my man  and could not for my life see anything to laugh at  till seeing the bear get up the tree  we all rode near to him",0.6,1,3,1
"2310","when we came to the tree  there was friday got out to the small end of a large branch  and the bear got about half way to him",0,0,0,0
"2311","as soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker  ha  says he to us  now you see me teachee the bear dance  so he began jumping and shaking the bough  at which the bear began to totter  but stood still  and began to look behind him  to see how he should get back  then  indeed  we did laugh heartily",0.6,0,3,3
"2312","but friday had not done with him by a great deal  when seeing him stand still  he called out to him again  as if he had supposed the bear could speak english  what  you come no farther",0.75,1,2,1
"2313","pray you come farther  so he left jumping and shaking the tree  and the bear  just as if he understood what he said  did come a little farther  then he began jumping again  and the bear stopped again",-0.3,0,0,1
"2314","we thought now was a good time to knock him in the head  and called to friday to stand still and we should shoot the bear  but he cried out earnestly  oh  pray",-0.15,1,1,2
"2315","oh  pray  no shoot  me shoot by and then  he would have said by and by",-0.4,0,-1,0
"2316","however  to shorten the story  friday danced so much  and the bear stood so ticklish  that we had laughing enough  but still could not imagine what the fellow would do  for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off  and we found the bear was too cunning for that too  for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down  but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet  so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it  and what the jest would be at last",1.85,3,6,3
"2317","but friday put us out of doubt quickly  for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough  and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther  well  well  says friday  you no come farther  me go  you no come to me  me come to you  and upon this he went out to the smaller end  where it would bend with his weight  and gently let himself down by it  sliding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet  and away he ran to his gun  took it up  and stood still",-1.1,2,-3,-1
"2318","well  said i to him  friday  what will you do now",0.8,1,0,0
"2319","why don t you shoot him",-0.5,0,-1,0
"2320","no shoot  says friday  no yet  me shoot now  me no kill  me stay  give you one more laugh  and  indeed  so he did  for when the bear saw his enemy gone  he came back from the bough  where he stood  but did it very cautiously  looking behind him every step  and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree  then  with the same hinder end foremost  he came down the tree  grasping it with his claws  and moving one foot at a time  very leisurely",-2.25,-3,-8,-1
"2321","at this juncture  and just before he could set his hind foot on the ground  friday stepped up close to him  clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear  and shot him dead",-1.65,-1,-3,-2
"2322","then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh  and when he saw we were pleased by our looks  he began to laugh very loud",0.5,-1,4,1
"2323","so we kill bear in my country  says friday",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"2324","so you kill them",-0.75,-1,-3,-1
"2325","says i  why  you have no guns",0,0,-1,0
"2326","no  says he  no gun  but shoot great much long arrow",-0.5,1,0,-2
"2327","this was a good diversion to us  but we were still in a wild place  and our guide very much hurt  and what to do we hardly knew  the howling of wolves ran much in my head  and  indeed  except the noise i once heard on the shore of africa  of which i have said something already  i never heard anything that filled me with so much horror",-0.9,-2,1,-1
"2328","these things  and the approach of night  called us off  or else  as friday would have had us  we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature off  which was worth saving  but we had near three leagues to go  and our guide hastened us  so we left him  and went forward on our journey",2.4,0,2,3
"2329","the ground was still covered with snow  though not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains  and the ravenous creatures  as we heard afterwards  were come down into the forest and plain country  pressed by hunger  to seek for food  and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages  where they surprised the country people  killed a great many of their sheep and horses  and some people too",-2,-2,-5,-1
"2330","we had one dangerous place to pass  and our guide told us if there were more wolves in the country we should find them there  and this was a small plain  surrounded with woods on every side  and a long  narrow defile  or lane  which we were to pass to get through the wood  and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge",-0.4,-2,-2,-1
"2331","it was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the wood  and a little after sunset when we came into the plain  we met with nothing in the first wood  except that in a little plain within the wood  which was not above two furlongs over  we saw five great wolves cross the road  full speed  one after another  as if they had been in chase of some prey  and had it in view  they took no notice of us  and were gone out of sight in a few moments",0.6,1,2,-1
"2332","upon this  our guide  who  by the way  was but a fainthearted fellow  bid us keep in a ready posture  for he believed there were more wolves a coming",1.3,0,-2,2
"2333","we kept our arms ready  and our eyes about us  but we saw no more wolves till we came through that wood  which was near half a league  and entered the plain",1.05,1,-1,1
"2334","as soon as we came into the plain  we had occasion enough to look about us",-0.25,1,0,0
"2335","the first object we met with was a dead horse  that is to say  a poor horse which the wolves had killed  and at least a dozen of them at work  we could not say eating him  but picking his bones rather  for they had eaten up all the flesh before",-1.75,-3,-8,0
"2336","we did not think fit to disturb them at their feast  neither did they take much notice of us",-0.1,-1,-1,0
"2337","friday would have let fly at them  but i would not suffer him by any means  for i found we were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware of",0.35,0,0,0
"2338","we had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner  and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us  all in a body  and most of them in a line  as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers",-0.3,-1,0,-1
"2339","i scarce knew in what manner to receive them  but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way  so we formed in a moment  but that we might not have too much interval  i ordered that only every other man should fire  and that the others  who had not fired  should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately  if they continued to advance upon us  and then that those that had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees again  but stand ready  every one with a pistol  for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man  so we were  by this method  able to fire six volleys  half of us at a time  however  at present we had no necessity  for upon firing the first volley  the enemy made a full stop  being terrified as well with the noise as with the fire",-2.15,-2,-14,-1
"2340","four of them being shot in the head  dropped  several others were wounded  and went bleeding off  as we could see by the snow",-0.9,-1,-1,-2
"2341","i found they stopped  but did not immediately retreat  whereupon  remembering that i had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man  i caused all the company to halloo as loud as they could  and i found the notion not altogether mistaken  for upon our shout they began to retire and turn about",-2.8,-3,-7,1
"2342","i then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear  which put them to the gallop  and away they went to the woods",-0.5,0,-2,-1
"2343","this gave us leisure to charge our pieces again  and that we might lose no time  we kept going  but we had but little more than loaded our fusees  and put ourselves in readiness  when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood on our left  only that it was farther onward  the same way we were to go",0.8,-3,-4,-1
"2344","the night was coming on  and the light began to be dusky  which made it worse on our side  but the noise increasing  we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures  and on a sudden we perceived three troops of wolves  one on our left  one behind us  and one in our front  so that we seemed to be surrounded with them  however  as they did not fall upon us  we kept our way forward  as fast as we could make our horses go  which  the way being very rough  was only a good hard trot",-1.15,-3,-3,-1
"2345","in this manner  we came in view of the entrance of a wood  through which we were to pass  at the farther side of the plain  but we were greatly surprised  when coming nearer the lane or pass  we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance",-0.5,-1,-2,1
"2346","on a sudden  at another opening of the wood  we heard the noise of a gun  and looking that way  out rushed a horse  with a saddle and a bridle on him  flying like the wind  and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him  full speed  the horse had the advantage of them  but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate  we doubted not but they would get up with him at last  no question but they did",0.05,1,1,2
"2347","but here we had a most horrible sight  for riding up to the entrance where the horse came out  we found the carcasses of another horse and of two men  devoured by the ravenous creatures  and one of the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun  for there lay a gun just by him fired off  but as to the man  his head and the upper part of his body was eaten up",-3.35,-2,-10,-3
"2348","this filled us with horror  and we knew not what course to take  but the creatures resolved us soon  for they gathered about us presently  in hopes of prey  and i verily believe there were three hundred of them",0.5,0,4,-1
"2349","it happened  very much to our advantage  that at the entrance into the wood  but a little way from it  there lay some large timber trees  which had been cut down the summer before  and i suppose lay there for carriage",0.5,1,1,1
"2350","i drew my little troop in among those trees  and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree  i advised them all to alight  and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork  to stand in a triangle  or three fronts  enclosing our horses in the centre",0,0,0,1
"2351","we did so  and it was well we did  for never was a more furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place",-0.2,0,-3,-1
"2352","they came on with a growling kind of noise  and mounted the piece of timber  which  as i said  was our breastwork  as if they were only rushing upon their prey  and this fury of theirs  it seems  was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses behind us",-1.1,-2,2,-3
"2353","i ordered our men to fire as before  every other man  and they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley  but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing  for they came on like devils  those behind pushing on those before",-1.85,0,-5,0
"2354","when we had fired a second volley of our fusees  we thought they stopped a little  and i hoped they would have gone off  but it was but a moment  for others came forward again  so we fired two volleys of our pistols  and i believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them  and lamed twice as many  yet they came on again",-0.8,-1,-6,1
"2355","i was loth to spend our shot too hastily  so i called my servant  not my man friday  for he was better employed  for  with the greatest dexterity imaginable  he had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged but  as i said  i called my other man  and giving him a horn of powder  i had him lay a train all along the piece of timber  and let it be a large train",1.75,1,2,1
"2356","he did so  and had but just time to get away  when the wolves came up to it  and some got upon it  when i  snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder  set it on fire  those that were upon the timber were scorched with it  and six or seven of them fell  or rather jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire  we despatched these in an instant  and the rest were so frightened with the light  which the night for it was now very near dark made more terrible that they drew back a little  upon which i ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley  and after that we gave a shout  upon this the wolves turned tail  and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the ground  and fell to cutting them with our swords  which answered our expectation  for the crying and howling they made was better understood by their fellows  so that they all fled and left us",-5.5,-5,-16,-5
"2357","we had  first and last  killed about threescore of them  and had it been daylight we had killed many more",-0.5,-1,-3,0
"2358","the field of battle being thus cleared  we made forward again  for we had still near a league to go",0.85,1,0,1
"2359","we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went several times  and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them  but the snow dazzling our eyes  we were not certain",0.15,1,4,-3
"2360","in about an hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge  which we found in a terrible fright and all in arms  for  it seems  the night before the wolves and some bears had broken into the village  and put them in such terror that they were obliged to keep guard night and day  but especially in the night  to preserve their cattle  and indeed their people",-2.3,-4,-9,-1
"2361","the next morning our guide was so ill  and his limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two wounds  that he could go no farther  so we were obliged to take a new guide here  and go to toulouse  where we found a warm climate  a fruitful  pleasant country  and no snow  no wolves  nor anything like them  but when we told our story at toulouse  they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains  especially when the snow lay on the ground  but they inquired much what kind of guide we had got who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season  and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured",2.35,2,6,4
"2362","when we told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle  they blamed us exceedingly  and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed  for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious  seeing their prey  and that at other times they are really afraid of a gun  but being excessively hungry  and raging on that account  the eagerness to come at the horses had made them senseless of danger  and that if we had not by the continual fire  and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder  mastered them  it had been great odds but that we had been torn to pieces  whereas  had we been content to have sat still on horseback  and fired as horsemen  they would not have taken the horses so much for their own  when men were on their backs  as otherwise  and withal  they told us that at last  if we had stood altogether  and left our horses  they would have been so eager to have devoured them  that we might have come off safe  especially having our firearms in our hands  being so many in number",-5.1,-1,-12,-7
"2363","for my part  i was never so sensible of danger in my life  for  seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open mouthed to devour us  and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to  i gave myself over for lost  and  as it was  i believe i shall never care to cross those mountains again  i think i would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea  though i was sure to meet with a storm once a week",-1.7,-2,-4,-3
"2364","i have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through france nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more advantage than i can",0.75,1,2,1
"2365","i travelled from toulouse to paris  and without any considerable stay came to calais  and landed safe at dover the th of january  after having had a severe cold season to travel in",-0.4,-1,-1,2
"2366","i was now come to the centre of my travels  and had in a little time all my new discovered estate safe about me  the bills of exchange which i brought with me having been currently paid",1.8,1,1,2
"2367","my principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient widow  who  in gratitude for the money i had sent her  thought no pains too much nor care too great to employ for me  and i trusted her so entirely that i was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects  and  indeed  i was very happy from the beginning  and now to the end  in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman",6.9,6,18,3
"2368","and now  having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the brazils  i wrote to my old friend at lisbon  who  having offered it to the two merchants  the survivors of my trustees  who lived in the brazils  they accepted the offer  and remitted thirty three thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at lisbon to pay for it",2.2,0,3,3
"2369","in return  i signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent from lisbon  and sent it to my old man  who sent me the bills of exchange for thirty two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate  reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him  the old man  during his life  and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life  which i had promised them  and which the plantation was to make good as a rent charge",1.4,2,4,1
"2370","and thus i have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure a life of providence s chequer work  and of a variety which the world will seldom be able to show the like of  beginning foolishly  but closing much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for",2.35,5,7,3
"2371","any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune i was past running any more hazards and so  indeed  i had been  if other circumstances had concurred  but i was inured to a wandering life  had no family  nor many relations  nor  however rich  had i contracted fresh acquaintance  and though i had sold my estate in the brazils  yet i could not keep that country out of my head  and had a great mind to be upon the wing again  especially i could not resist the strong inclination i had to see my island  and to know if the poor spaniards were in being there",1.35,4,10,-1
"2372","my true friend  the widow  earnestly dissuaded me from it  and so far prevailed with me  that for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad  during which time i took my two nephews  the children of one of my brothers  into my care  the eldest  having something of his own  i bred up as a gentleman  and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate after my decease",4.05,1,5,4
"2373","the other i placed with the captain of a ship  and after five years  finding him a sensible  bold  enterprising young fellow  i put him into a good ship  and sent him to sea  and this young fellow afterwards drew me in  as old as i was  to further adventures myself",3.6,3,8,7
"2374","in the meantime  i in part settled myself here  for  first of all  i married  and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction  and had three children  two sons and one daughter  but my wife dying  and my nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to spain  my inclination to go abroad  and his importunity  prevailed  and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the east indies  this was in the year",1.2,-1,0,2
"2375","in this voyage i visited my new colony in the island  saw my successors the spaniards  had the old story of their lives and of the villains i left there  how at first they insulted the poor spaniards  how they afterwards agreed  disagreed  united  separated  and how at last the spaniards were obliged to use violence with them  how they were subjected to the spaniards  how honestly the spaniards used them a history  if it were entered into  as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part particularly  also  as to their battles with the caribbeans  who landed several times upon the island  and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself  and how five of them made an attempt upon the mainland  and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners  by which  at my coming  i found about twenty young children on the island",-1.05,-2,-4,6
"2376","here i stayed about twenty days  left them supplies of all necessary things  and particularly of arms  powder  shot  clothes  tools  and two workmen  which i had brought from england with me  viz  a carpenter and a smith",-0.4,0,0,0
"2377","besides this  i shared the lands into parts with them  reserved to myself the property of the whole  but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed on  and having settled all things with them  and engaged them not to leave the place  i left them there",1.65,0,1,1
"2378","from thence i touched at the brazils  from whence i sent a bark  which i bought there  with more people to the island  and in it  besides other supplies  i sent seven women  being such as i found proper for service  or for wives to such as would take them",1.35,1,0,1
"2379","as to the englishmen  i promised to send them some women from england  with a good cargo of necessaries  if they would apply themselves to planting which i afterwards could not perform",1.25,2,4,1
"2380","the fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for them",1.25,2,2,1
"2381","i sent them  also  from the brazils  five cows  three of them being big with calf  some sheep  and some hogs  which when i came again were considerably increased",0.35,-1,2,1
"2382","but all these things  with an account how three hundred caribbees came and invaded them  and ruined their plantations  and how they fought with that whole number twice  and were at first defeated  and one of them killed  but at last  a storm destroying their enemies canoes  they famished or destroyed almost all the rest  and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation  and still lived upon the island",-5.35,-2,-15,-5
"2383","all these things  with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own  for ten years more  i shall give a farther account of in the second part of my story",1.05,0,2,0
