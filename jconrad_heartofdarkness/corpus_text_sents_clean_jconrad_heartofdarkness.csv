0,the nellie  a cruising yawl  swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails  and was at rest 
1,the flood had made  the wind was nearly calm  and being bound down the river  the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide 
2,the sea reach of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway 
3,in the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint  and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked  with gleams of varnished sprits 
4,a haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness 
5,the air was dark above gravesend  and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom  brooding motionless over the biggest  and the greatest  town on earth 
6,the director of companies was our captain and our host 
7,we four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward 
8,on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical 
9,he resembled a pilot  which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified 
10,it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary  but behind him  within the brooding gloom 
11,between us there was  as have already said somewhere  the bond of the sea 
12,besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation  it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other own yarns  and even convictions  the lawyer  the best of old fellows  had  because of his many years and many virtues  the only cushion on deck  and was lying on the only rug 
13,the accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes  and was toying architecturally with the bones 
14,marlow sat cross legged right aft  leaning against the mizzen mast 
15,he had sunken cheeks  a yellow complexion  a straight back  an ascetic aspect  and  with his arms dropped  the palms of hands outwards  resembled an idol 
16,the director  satisfied the anchor had good hold  made his way aft and sat down amongst us 
17,we exchanged a few words lazily 
18,afterwards there was silence on board the yacht 
19,for some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes 
20,we felt meditative  and fit for nothing but placid staring 
21,the day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance 
22,the water shone pacifically  the sky  without a speck  was a benign immensity of unstained light  the very mist on the essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric  hung from the wooded rises inland  and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds 
23,only the gloom to the west  brooding over the upper reaches  became more somber every minute  as if angered by the approach of the sun 
24,and at last  in its curved and imperceptible fall  the sun sank low  and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat  as if about to go out suddenly  stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men 
25,forthwith a change came over the waters  and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound 
26,the old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day  after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks  spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth 
27,we looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever  but in the august light of abiding memories 
28,and indeed nothing is easier for a man who has  as the phrase goes   followed the sea  with reverence and affection  than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames 
29,the tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service  crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea 
30,it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud  from sir francis drake to sir john franklin  knights all  titled and untitled  the great knights errant of the sea 
31,it had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time  from the golden hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure  to be visited by the queen own highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale  to the erebus and terror  bound on other conquests  and that never returned  it had known the ships and the men  they had sailed from deptford  from greenwich  from erith  the adventurers and the settlers  kings  ships and the ships of men on  change  captains  admirals  the dark  interlopers  of the eastern trade  and the commissioned  generals  of east india fleets 
32,hunters for gold or pursuers of fame  they all had gone out on that stream  bearing the sword  and often the torch  messengers of the might within the land  bearers of a spark from the sacred fire 
33,what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth 
34,      the dreams of men  the seed of commonwealths  the germs of empires 
35,the sun set  the dusk fell on the stream  and lights began to appear along the shore 
36,the chapman lighthouse  a three legged thing erect on a mud flat  shone strongly 
37,lights of ships moved in the fairway  a great stir of lights going up and going down 
38,and farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky  a brooding gloom in sunshine  a lurid glare under the stars 
39, and this also   said marlow suddenly   has been one of the dark places of the earth  
40,he was the only man of us who still  followed the sea  
41,the worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class 
42,he was a seaman  but he was a wanderer  too  while most seamen lead  if one may so express it  a sedentary life 
43,their minds are of the stay at home order  and their home is always with them  the ship  and so is their country  the sea 
44,one ship is very much like another  and the sea is always the same 
45,in the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores  the foreign faces  the changing immensity of life  glide past  veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance  for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself  which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny 
46,for the rest  after his hours of work  a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent  and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing 
47,the yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity  the whole meaning of which lies within the she will of a cracked nut 
48,but marlow was not typical  if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted   and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside  enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze  in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine 
49,his remark did not seem at all surprising 
50,it was just like marlow 
51,it was accepted in silence 
52,no one took the trouble to grunt even  and presently he said  very slow  
53, was thinking of very old times  when the romans first came here  nineteen hundred years ago  the other day        light came out of this river since  you say knights  yes  but it is like a running blaze on a plain  like a flash of lightning in the clouds  we live in the flicker  may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling  but darkness was here yesterday  imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine  what d ye call  them   trireme in the mediterranean  ordered suddenly to the north  run overland across the gauls in a hurry  put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries   a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been too  used to build  apparently by the hundred  in a month or two  if we may believe what we read  imagine him here  the very end of the world  a sea the color of lead  a sky the color of smoke  a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina  and going up this river with stores  or orders  or what you like  sandbanks  marshes  forests  savages   precious little to eat fit for a civilized man  nothing but thames water to drink  no falernian wine here  no going ashore  here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness  like a needle in a bundle of hay  cold  fog  tempests  disease  exile  and death   death skulking in the air  in the water  in the bush  they must have been dying like flies here  oh yes  he did it  did it very well  too  no doubt  and without thinking much about it either  except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time  perhaps  they were men enough to face the darkness  and perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at ravenna by and by  if he had good friends in rome and survived the awful climate  or think of a decent young citizen in a toga  perhaps too much dice  you know  coming out here in the train of some prefect  or tax gatherer  or trader even  to mend his fortunes  land in a swamp  march through the woods  and in some inland post feel the savagery  the utter savagery  had closed round him   all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest  in the jungles  in the hearts of wild men  there is no initiation either into such mysteries  he has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible  which is also detestable  and it has a fascination  too  that goes to work upon him  the fascination of the abomination  you know  imagine the growing regrets  the longing to escape  the powerless disgust  the surrender  the hate  
54,he paused 
55, mind   he began again  lifting one arm from the elbow  the palm of the hand outwards  so that  with his legs folded before him  he had the pose of a buddha preaching in european clothes and without a lotus flower   mind  none of us would feel exactly like this  what saves us is efficiency  the devotion to efficiency  but these chaps were not much account  really  they were no colonists  their administration was merely a squeeze  and nothing more  suspect  they were conquerors  and for that you want only brute force  nothing to boast of  when you have it  since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others  they grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got  it was just robbery with violence  aggravated murder on a great scale  and men going at it blind  as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness  the conquest of the earth  which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves  is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much  what redeems it is the idea only  an idea at the back of it  not a sentimental pretense but an idea  and an unselfish belief in the idea  something you can set up  and bow down before  and offer a sacrifice to        
56,he broke off 
57,flames glided in the river  small green flames  red flames  white flames  pursuing  overtaking  joining  crossing each other  then separating slowly or hastily  the traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river  we looked on  waiting patiently  there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood  but it was only after a long silence  when he said  in a hesitating voice   suppose you fellows remember did once turn fresh water sailor for a bit   that we knew we were fated  before the ebb began to run  to hear about one of marlow own inconclusive experiences 
58, do not want to bother you much with what happened to me personally   he began  showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to hear   yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how got out there  what saw  how went up that river to the place where first met the poor chap 
59,it was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience 
60,it seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me  and into my thoughts  it was somber enough too  and pitiful  not extraordinary in any way  not very clear either 
61,no  not very clear 
62,and yet it seemed to throw a kind of light 
63, had then  as you remember  just returned to london after a lot of indian ocean  pacific  china seas  a regular dose of the east  six years or so  and was loafing about  hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes  just as though had got a heavenly mission to civilize you 
64,it was very fine for a time  but after a bit did get tired of resting 
65,then began to look for a ship  should think the hardest work on earth 
66,but the ships would not even look at me 
67,and got tired of that game too 
68, now when was a little chap had a passion for maps 
69,would look for hours at south america  or africa  or australia  and lose myself in all the glories of exploration 
70,at that time there were many blank spaces on the earth  and when saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map  but they all look that  would put my finger on it and say   when grow up will go there  
71,the north pole was one of these places  remember 
72,well  have not been there yet  and shall not try now 
73,the glamour own off 
74,other places were scattered about the equator  and in every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres 
75,have been in some of them  and       well  we will not talk about that 
76,but there was one yet  the biggest  the most blank  so to speak  that had a hankering after 
77, true  by this time it was not a blank space any more 
78,it had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names 
79,it had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery  a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over 
80,it had become a place of darkness 
81,but there was in it one river especially  a mighty big river  that you could see on the map  resembling an immense snake uncoiled  with its head in the sea  its body at rest curving afar over a vast country  and its tail lost in the depths of the land 
82,and as looked at the map of it in a shop window  it fascinated me as a snake would a bird  a silly little bird  then remembered there was a big concern  a company for trade on that river  dash it all  thought to myself  they cannot trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water  steamboats 
83,why should not try to get charge of one 
84,went on along fleet street  but could not shake off the idea 
85,the snake had charmed me 
86, you understand it was a continental concern  that trading society  but have a lot of relations living on the continent  because it is cheap and not so nasty as it looks  they say 
87, am sorry to own began to worry them 
88,this was already a fresh departure for me  was not used to get things that way  you know 
89,always went my own road and on my own legs where had a mind to go 
90,would not have believed it of myself  but  then  you see  felt somehow must get there by hook or by crook 
91,so worried them 
92,the men said  my dear fellow   and did nothing 
93,then  would you believe it   tried the women 
94,i  charlie marlow  set the women to work  to get a job 
95,heavens 
96,well  you see  the notion drove me  had an aunt  a dear enthusiastic soul 
97,she wrote   it will be delightful  am ready to do anything  anything for you  it is a glorious idea  know the wife of a very high personage in the administration  and also a man who has lots of influence with    c 
98,she was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat  if such was my fancy 
99, got my appointment  of course  and got it very quick  it appears the company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives  this was my chance  and it made me the more anxious to go  it was only months and months afterwards  when made the attempt to recover what was left of the body  that heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens  yes  two black hens  fresleven  that was the fellow own name  a dane  thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain  so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick 
100,oh  it did not surprise me in the least to hear this  and at the same time to be told that fresleven was the gentlest  quietest creature that ever walked on two legs 
101,no doubt he was  but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble because  you know  and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self respect in some way 
102,therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly  while a big crowd of his people watched him  thunderstruck  till some man   was told the chief own son   in desperation at hearing the old chap yell  made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man  and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder blades 
103,then the whole population cleared into the forest  expecting all kinds of calamities to happen  while  on the other hand  the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic  in charge of the engineer  believe 
104,afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about fresleven own remains  till got out and stepped into his shoes 
105,could not let it rest  though  but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor  the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones 
106,they were all there 
107,the supernatural being had not been touched after he fell 
108,and the village was deserted  the huts gaped black  rotting  all askew within the fallen enclosures 
109,a calamity had come to it  sure enough 
110,the people had vanished 
111,mad terror had scattered them  men  women  and children  through the bush  and they had never returned 
112,what became of the hens do not know either 
113,should think the because of progress got them  anyhow 
114,however  through this glorious affair got my appointment  before had fairly begun to hope for it 
115, flew around like mad to get ready  and before forty eight hours was crossing the channel to show myself to my employers  and sign the contract 
116,in a very few hours arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulcher 
117,prejudice no doubt 
118,had no difficulty in finding the company own offices 
119,it was the biggest thing in the town  and everybody met was full of it 
120,they were going to run an over sea empire  and make no end of coin by trade 
121, a narrow and deserted street in deep shadow  high houses  innumerable windows with venetian blinds  a dead silence  grass sprouting between the stones  imposing carriage archways right and left  immense double doors standing ponderously ajar 
122,slipped through one of these cracks  went up a swept and ungarnished staircase  as arid as a desert  and opened the first door came to 
123,two women  one fat and the other slim  sat on straw bottomed chairs  knitting black wool 
124,the slim one got up and walked straight at me  still knitting with downcast eyes  and only just as began to think of getting out of her way  as you would for a somnambulist  stood still  and looked up 
125,her dress was as plain as an umbrella cover  and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting room 
126,gave my name  and looked about 
127,deal table in the middle  plain chairs all round the walls  on one end a large shining map  marked with all the colors of a rainbow 
128,there was a vast amount of red  good to see at any time  because one knows that some real work is done in there  a deuce of a lot of blue  a little green  smears of orange  and  on the east coast  a purple patch  to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager beer 
129,however  was not going into any of these 
130,was going into the yellow 
131,dead in the center 
132,and the river was there  fascinating  deadly  like a snake 
133,ough 
134,a door opened  a white haired secretarial head  but wearing a compassionate expression  appeared  and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary 
135,its light was dim  and a heavy writing desk squatted in the middle 
136,from behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock coat 
137,the great man himself 
138,he was five feet six  should judge  and had his grip on the handle end of ever so many millions 
139,he shook hands  fancy  murmured vaguely  was satisfied with my french 
140,bon voyage 
141, in about forty five seconds found myself again in the waiting room with the compassionate secretary  who  full of desolation and sympathy  made me sign some document 
142,believe undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets 
143,well  am not going to 
144, began to feel slightly uneasy 
145,you know am not used to such ceremonies  and there was something ominous in the atmosphere 
146,it was just as though had been let into some conspiracy  do not know  something not quite right  and was glad to get out 
147,in the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly 
148,people were arriving  and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them 
149,the old one sat on her chair 
150,her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot warmer  and a cat reposed on her lap 
151,she wore a starched white affair on her head  had a wart on one cheek  and silver rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose 
152,she glanced at me above the glasses 
153,the swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me 
154,two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over  and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom 
155,she seemed to know all about them and about me too 
156,an eerie feeling came over me 
157,she seemed uncanny and fateful 
158,often far away there thought of these two  guarding the door of darkness  knitting black wool as for a warm pall  one introducing  introducing continuously to the unknown  the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes 
159,ave 
160,old knitter of black wool 
161,morituri te salutant 
162,not many of those she looked at ever saw her again  not half  by a long way 
163, there was yet a visit to the doctor 
164, a simple formality   assured me the secretary  with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows 
165,accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow  some clerk suppose   there must have been clerks in the business  though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead   came from somewhere up stairs  and led me forth 
166,he was shabby and careless  with ink stains on the sleeves of his jacket  and his cravat was large and billowy  under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot 
167,it was a little too early for the doctor  so proposed a drink  and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality 
168,as we sat over our vermouths he glorified the company own business  and by and by expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there 
169,he became very cool and collected all at once 
170, not such a fool as look  quoth plato to his disciples   he said sententiously  emptied his glass with great resolution  and we rose 
171, the old doctor felt my pulse  evidently thinking of something else the while 
172, good  good for there   he mumbled  and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether would let him measure my head 
173,rather surprised  said yes  when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way  taking notes carefully 
174,he was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine  with his feet in slippers  and thought him a harmless fool 
175, always ask leave  in the interests of science  to measure the crania of those going out there   he said 
176, and when they come back  too   asked 
177, oh  never see them   he remarked   and  moreover  the changes take place inside  you know  
178,he smiled  as if at some quiet joke 
179, owno you are going out there  famous  interesting too  
180,he gave me a searching glance  and made another note 
181, ever any madness in your family   he asked  in a matter of fact tone 
182,felt very annoyed 
183, is that question in the interests of science too    it would be   he said  without taking notice of my irritation   interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals  on the spot  but         are you an alienist   interrupted 
184, every doctor should be  a little   answered that original  imperturbably 
185, have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must help me to prove  this is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency  the mere wealth leave to others  pardon my questions  but you are the first englishman coming under my observation         hastened to assure him was not in the least typical 
186, if were   said i   would not be talking like this with you    what you say is rather profound  and probably erroneous   he said  with a laugh 
187, avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun  adieu  how do you english say  eh  good by  ah  good by  adieu  in the tropics one must before everything keep calm         he lifted a warning forefinger 
188,       du calme  du calme 
189,adieu 
190, one thing more remained to do  say good by to my excellent aunt 
191,found her triumphant 
192,had a cup of tea  the last decent cup of tea for many days  and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady own drawing room to look  we had a long quiet chat by the fireside 
193,in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary  and goodness knows to how many more people besides  as an exceptional and gifted creature  a piece of good fortune for the company  a man you do not get hold of every day 
194,good heavens  and was going to take charge of a two penny halfpenny river steamboat with a penny whistle attached 
195,it appeared  however  was also one of the workers  with a capital  you know 
196,something like an emissary of light  something like a lower sort of apostle 
197,there had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time  and the excellent woman  living right in the rush of all that humbug  got carried off her feet 
198,she talked about  weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways   till  upon my word  she made me quite uncomfortable 
199,ventured to hint that the company was run for profit 
200,  you forget  dear charlie  that the laborer is worthy of his hire   she said  brightly 
201,it is queer how out of touch with truth women are 
202,they live in a world of their own  and there had never been anything like it  and never can be 
203,it is too beautiful altogether  and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset 
204,some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over 
205, after this got embraced  told to wear flannel  be sure to write often  and so on  and left  in the street  do not know why  a queer feeling came to me that was an impostor 
206,odd thing that i  who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty four hours  notice  with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street  had a moment  will not say of hesitation  but of startled pause  before this commonplace affair 
207,the best way can explain it to you is by saying that  for a second or two  felt as though  instead of going to the center of a continent  were about to set off for the center of the earth 
208, left in a french steamer  and she called in every blamed port they have out there  for  as far as could see  the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom house officers 
209,watched the coast 
210,watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma 
211,there it is before you  smiling  frowning  inviting  grand  mean  insipid  or savage  and always mute with an air of whispering   come and find out  
212,this one was almost featureless  as if still in the making  with an aspect of monotonous grimness 
213,the edge of a colossal jungle  so dark green as to be almost black  fringed with white surf  ran straight  like a ruled line  far  far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist 
214,the sun was fierce  the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam 
215,here and there grayish whitish specks showed up  clustered inside the white surf  with a flag flying above them perhaps 
216,settlements some centuries old  and still no bigger than pin heads on the untouched expanse of their background 
217,we pounded along  stopped  landed soldiers  went on  landed custom house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a god forsaken wilderness  with a tin she would and a flag pole lost in it  landed more soldiers  to take care of the custom house clerks  presumably 
218,some  heard  got drowned in the surf  but whether they did or not  nobody seemed particularly to care 
219,they were just flung out there  and on we went 
220,every day the coast looked the same  as though we had not moved  but we passed various places  trading places  with names like gran  bassam little popo  names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth 
221,the idleness of a passenger  my isolation amongst all these men with whom had no point of contact  the oily and languid sea  the uniform somberness of the coast  seemed to keep me away from the truth of things  within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion 
222,the voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure  like the speech of a brother 
223,it was something natural  that had its reason  that had a meaning 
224,now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality 
225,it was paddled by black fellows 
226,you could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening 
227,they shouted  sang  their bodies streamed with perspiration  they had faces like grotesque masks  these chaps  but they had bone  muscle  a wild vitality  an intense energy of movement  that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast 
228,they wanted no excuse for being there 
229,they were a great comfort to look at 
230,for a time would feel belonged still to a world of straightforward facts  but the feeling would not last long 
231,something would turn up to scare it away 
232,once  remember  we came upon a man of war anchored off the coast 
233,there was not even a she would there  and she was shelling the bush 
234,it appears the french had one of their wars going on thereabouts 
235,her ensign dropped limp like a rag  the muzzles of the long eight inch guns stuck out all over the low hull  the greasy  slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down  swaying her thin masts 
236,in the empty immensity of earth  sky  and water  there she was  incomprehensible  firing into a continent 
237,pop  would go one of the eight inch guns  a small flame would dart and vanish  a little white smoke would disappear  a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech  and nothing happened  nothing could happen  there was a touch of insanity in the proceeding  a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight  and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives  he called them enemies   hidden out of sight somewhere 
238, we gave her her letters  heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day  and went on 
239,we called at some more places with farcical names  where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb  all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf  as if nature herself had tried to ward off intruders  in and out of rivers  streams of death in life  whose banks were rotting into mud  whose waters  thickened into slime  invaded the contorted mangroves  that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair 
240,nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression  but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me 
241,it was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares 
242, it was upward of thirty days before saw the mouth of the big river 
243,we anchored off the seat of the government 
244,but my work would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on 
245,so as soon as could made a start for a place thirty miles higher up 
246, had my passage on a little sea going steamer 
247,her captain was a swede  and knowing me for a seaman  invited me on the bridge 
248,he was a young man  lean  fair  and morose  with lanky hair and a shuffling gait 
249,as we left the miserable little wharf  he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore 
250, been living there   he asked 
251,said   yes    fine lot these government chaps  are they not   he went on  speaking english with great precision and considerable bitterness 
252, it is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month  wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country   said to him expected to see that soon 
253, owno o o   he exclaimed 
254,he shuffled athwart  keeping one eye ahead vigilantly 
255, do not be too sure   he continued 
256, the other day took up a man who hanged himself on the road  he was a swede  too    hanged himself  why  in god own name   cried 
257,he kept on looking out watchfully 
258, who knows  the sun too much for him  or the country perhaps  
259, at last we opened a reach 
260,a rocky cliff appeared  mounds of turned up earth by the shore  houses on a hill  others  with iron roofs  amongst a waste of excavations  or hanging to the declivity 
261,a continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation 
262,a lot of people  mostly black and naked  moved about like ants 
263,a jetty projected into the river 
264,a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare 
265, there is your company own station   said the swede  pointing to three wooden barrack like structures on the rocky slope 
266, will send your things up  four boxes did you say  so  farewell  
267, came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass  then found a path leading up the hill 
268,it turned aside for the bowlders  and also for an undersized railway truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air 
269,one was off 
270,the thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal 
271,came upon more pieces of decaying machinery  a stack of rusty rails 
272,to the left a clump of trees made a shady spot  where dark things seemed to stir feebly 
273,blinked  the path was steep 
274,a horn tooted to the right  and saw the black people run 
275,a heavy and dull detonation shook the ground  a puff of smoke came out of the cliff  and that was all 
276,no change appeared on the face of the rock 
277,they were building a railway 
278,the cliff was not in the way or anything  but this objectless blasting was all the work going on 
279, a slight clinking behind me made me turn my head 
280,six black men advanced in a file  toiling up the path 
281,they walked erect and slow  balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads  and the clink kept time with their footsteps 
282,black rags were wound round their loins  and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails 
283,could see every rib  the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope  each had an iron collar on his neck  and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them  rhythmically clinking 
284,another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war had seen firing into a continent 
285,it was the same kind of ominous voice  but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies 
286,they were called criminals  and the outraged law  like the bursting shells  had come to them  an insoluble mystery from over the sea 
287,all their meager breasts panted together  the violently dilated nostrils quivered  the eyes stared stonily uphill 
288,they passed me within six inches  without a glance  with that complete  deathlike indifference of unhappy savages 
289,behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed  the product of the new forces at work  strolled despondently  carrying a rifle by its middle 
290,he had a uniform jacket with one button off  and seeing a white man on the path  hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity 
291,this was simple prudence  white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who might be 
292,he was speedily reassured  and with a large  white  rascally grin  and a glance at his charge  seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust 
293,after all  also was a part of the great because of these high and just proceedings 
294, instead of going up  turned and descended to the left 
295,my idea was to let that chain gang get out of sight before climbed the hill 
296,you know am not particularly tender  I have had to strike and to fend off 
297,I have had to resist and to attack sometimes  that is only one way of resisting  without counting the exact cost  according to the demands of such sort of life as had blundered into 
298,I have seen the devil of violence  and the devil of greed  and the devil of hot desire  but  by all the stars  these were strong  lusty  red eyed devils  that swayed and drove men  men  tell you 
299,but as stood on this hillside  foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land would become acquainted with a flabby  pretending  weak eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly 
300,how insidious he could be  too  was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther 
301,for a moment stood appalled  as though by a warning 
302,finally descended the hill  obliquely  towards the trees had seen 
303, avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope  the purpose of which found it impossible to divine 
304,it was not a quarry or a sandpit  anyhow 
305,it was just a hole 
306,it might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do 
307,do not know 
308,then nearly fell into a very narrow ravine  almost no more than a scar in the hillside 
309,discovered that a lot of imported drainage pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there 
310,there was not one that was not broken 
311,it was a wanton smash up 
312,at last got under the trees 
313,my purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment  but no sooner within than it seemed to me had stepped into a gloomy circle of some inferno 
314,the rapids were near  and an uninterrupted  uniform  headlong  rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove  where not a breath stirred  not a leaf moved  with a mysterious sound  as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible 
315, black shapes crouched  lay  sat between the trees  leaning against the trunks  clinging to the earth  half coming out  half effaced within the dim light  in all the attitudes of pain  abandonment  and despair 
316,another mine on the cliff went off  followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet 
317,the work was going on 
318,the work 
319,and this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die 
320, they were dying slowly  it was very clear  they were not enemies  they were not criminals  they were nothing earthly now   nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation  lying confusedly in the greenish gloom 
321,brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts  lost in uncongenial surroundings  fed on unfamiliar food  they sickened  became inefficient  and were then allowed to crawl away and rest 
322,these moribund shapes were free as air  and nearly as thin  began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees  then  glancing down  saw a face near my hand  the black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree  and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me  enormous and vacant  a kind of blind  white flicker in the depths of the orbs  which died out slowly  the man seemed young  almost a boy  but you know with them it is hard to tell  found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good swede own ship own biscuits had in my pocket  the fingers closed slowly on it and held  there was no other movement and no other glance 
323,he had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck  why  where did he get it  was it a badge  an ornament  a charm  a propitiatory act 
324,was there any idea at all connected with it 
325,it looked startling round his black neck  this bit of white thread from beyond the seas 
326, near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up 
327,one  with his chin propped on his knees  stared at nothing  in an intolerable and appalling manner  his brother phantom rested its forehead  as if overcome with a great weariness  and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse  as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence 
328,while stood horror struck  one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees  and went off on all fours towards the river to drink 
329,he lapped out of his hand  then sat up in the sunlight  crossing his shins in front of him  and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone 
330, did not want any more loitering in the shade  and made haste towards the station 
331,when near the buildings met a white man  in such an unexpected elegance of get up that in the first moment took him for a sort of vision 
332,saw a high starched collar  white cuffs  a light alpaca jacket  snowy trousers  a clear necktie  and varnished boots 
333,no hat 
334,hair parted  brushed  oiled  under a green lined parasol held in a big white hand 
335,he was amazing  and had a penholder behind his ear 
336, shook hands with this miracle  and learned he was the company own chief accountant  and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station 
337,he had come out for a moment  he said   to get a breath of fresh air  
338,the expression sounded wonderfully odd  with its suggestion of sedentary desk life 
339,would not have mentioned the fellow to you at all  only it was from his lips that first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time 
340,moreover  respected the fellow 
341,yes  respected his collars  his vast cuffs  his brushed hair 
342,his appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser own dummy  but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance 
343,that is backbone 
344,his starched collars and got up shirt fronts were achievements of character 
345,he had been out nearly three years  and  later on  could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen 
346,he had just the faintest blush  and said modestly   I have been teaching one of the native women about the station  it was difficult  she had a distaste for the work  
347,this man had verily accomplished something 
348,and he was devoted to his books  which were in apple pie order 
349, everything else in the station was in a muddle   heads  things  buildings 
350,strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed  a stream of manufactured goods  rubbishy cottons  beads  and brass wire sent into the depths of darkness  and in return came a precious trickle of ivory 
351, had to wait in the station for ten days  an eternity 
352,lived in a hut in the yard  but to be out of the chaos would sometimes get into the accountant own office 
353,it was built of horizontal planks  and so badly put together that  as he bent over his high desk  he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight 
354,there was no need to open the big shutter to see 
355,it was hot there too  big flies buzzed fiendishly  and did not sting  but stabbed 
356,sat generally on the floor  while  of faultless appearance  and even slightly scented   perching on a high stool  he wrote  he wrote 
357,sometimes he stood up for exercise 
358,when a truckle bed with a sick man  some invalided agent from up country  was put in there  he exhibited a gentle annoyance 
359, the groans of this sick person   he said   distract my attention  and without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate  
360, one day he remarked  without lifting his head   in the interior you will no doubt meet mr  kurtz  
361,on my asking who mr  kurtz was  he said he was a first class agent  and seeing my disappointment at this information  he added slowly  laying down his pen   he is a very remarkable person  
362,further questions elicited from him that mr  kurtz was at present in charge of a trading post  a very important one  in the true ivory country  at  the very bottom of there  sends in as much ivory as all the others put together        
363,he began to write again 
364,the sick man was too ill to groan 
365,the flies buzzed in a great peace 
366, suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet 
367,a caravan had come in 
368,a violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks 
369,all the carriers were speaking together  and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard  giving it up  tearfully for the twentieth time that day 
370,      he rose slowly 
371, what a frightful row   he said 
372,he crossed the room gently to look at the sick man  and returning  said to me   he does not hear    what  dead   asked  startled 
373, no  not yet   he answered  with great composure 
374,then  alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station yard   when one has got to make correct entries  one comes to hate those savages  hate them to the death   he remained thoughtful for a moment   when you see mr  kurtz   he went on   tell him from me that everything here   he glanced at the desk   is very satisfactory  do not like to write to him  with those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter  at that central station   he stared at me for a moment with his mild  bulging eyes   oh  he will go far  very far   he began again   he will be a somebody in the administration before long  they  above  the council in europe  you know  mean him to be  
375, he turned to his work 
376,the noise outside had ceased  and presently in going out stopped at the door 
377,in the steady buzz of flies the homeward bound agent was lying flushed and insensible  the other  bent over his books  was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions  and fifty feet below the doorstep could see the still tree tops of the grove of death 
378, next day left that station at last  with a caravan of sixty men  for a two hundred mile tramp 
379, no use telling you much about that 
380,paths  paths  everywhere  a stamped in network of paths spreading over the empty land  through long grass  through burnt grass  through thickets  down and up chilly ravines  up and down stony hills ablaze with heat  and a solitude  a solitude  nobody  not a hut 
381,the population had cleared out a long time ago 
382,well  if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between deal and gravesend  catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them  fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon 
383,only here the dwellings were gone too 
384,still passed through several abandoned villages 
385,there is something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls 
386,day after day  with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me  each pair under a  lb 
387,load 
388,camp  cook  sleep  strike camp  march 
389,now and then a carrier dead in harness  at rest in the long grass near the path  with an empty water gourd and his long staff lying by his side 
390,a great silence around and above 
391,perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far off drums  sinking  swelling  a tremor vast  faint  a sound weird  appealing  suggestive  and wild  and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells in a christian country  once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform  camping on the path with an armed escort of lank zanzibaris  very hospitable and festive  not to say drunk 
392,was looking after the upkeep of the road  he declared 
393,cannot say saw any road or any upkeep  unless the body of a middle aged negro  with a bullet hole in the forehead  upon which absolutely stumbled three miles farther on  may be considered as a permanent improvement 
394,had a white companion too  not a bad chap  but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides  miles away from the least bit of shade and water 
395,annoying  you know  to hold your own coat like a parasol over a man own head while he is coming to 
396,could not help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all 
397, to make money  of course  what do you think   he said  scornfully 
398,then he got fever  and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole 
399,as he weighed sixteen stone had no end of rows with the carriers 
400,they jibbed  ran away  sneaked off with their loads in the night  quite a mutiny  so  one evening  made a speech in english with gestures  not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me  and the next morning started the hammock off in front all right  an hour afterwards came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush  man  hammock  groans  blankets  horrors 
401,the heavy pole had skinned his poor nose 
402,he was very anxious for me to kill somebody  but there was not the shadow of a carrier near 
403,remembered the old doctor    it would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals  on the spot   felt was becoming scientifically interesting  however  all that is to no purpose  on the fifteenth day came in sight of the big river again  and hobbled into the central station  it was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest  with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side  and on the three others inclosed by a crazy fence of rushes  a neglected gap was all the gate it had  and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show  white men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings  strolling up to take a look at me  and then retired out of sight somewhere  one of them  a stout  excitable chap with black mustaches  informed me with great volubility and many digressions  as soon as told him who was  that my steamer was at the bottom of the river  was thunderstruck  what  how  why  oh  it was  right   the  manager himself  was there  all quite correct   everybody had behaved splendidly  splendidly     you must   he said in agitation   go and see the general manager at once  he is waiting  
404, did not see the real significance of that wreck at once 
405,fancy see it now  but am not sure  not at all  certainly the affair was too stupid  when think of it  to be altogether natural 
406,still 
407,      but at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance 
408,the steamer was sunk 
409,they had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board  in charge of some volunteer skipper  and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones  and she sank near the south bank 
410,asked myself what was to do there  now my boat was lost 
411,as a matter of fact  had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river 
412,had to set about it the very next day 
413,that  and the repairs when brought the pieces to the station  took some months 
414, my first interview with the manager was curious 
415,he did not ask me to sit down after my twenty mile walk that morning 
416,he was commonplace in complexion  in features  in manners  and in voice 
417,he was of middle size and of ordinary build 
418,his eyes  of the usual blue  were perhaps remarkably cold  and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an ax 
419,but even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention 
420,otherwise there was only an indefinable  faint expression of his lips  something stealthy  a smile  not a smile  remember it  but cannot explain  it was unconscious  this smile was  though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant  it came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable  he was a common trader  from his youth up employed in these parts  nothing more 
421,he was obeyed  yet he inspired neither love nor fear  nor even respect 
422,he inspired uneasiness 
423,that was it 
424,uneasiness 
425,not a definite mistrust  just uneasiness  nothing more 
426,you have no idea how effective such a       a       faculty can be 
427,he had no genius for organizing  for initiative  or for order even 
428,that was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station 
429,he had no learning  and no intelligence 
430,his position had come to him  why  perhaps because he was never ill       he had served three terms of three years out there       because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself  when he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale  pompously 
431,jack ashore  with a difference  in externals only 
432,this one could gather from his casual talk 
433,he originated nothing  he could keep the routine going  that is all  but he was great  he was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man  he never gave that secret away  perhaps there was nothing within him  such a suspicion made one pause  for out there there were no external checks 
434,once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every  agent  in the station  he was heard to say   men who come out here should have no entrails  
435,he sealed the utterance with that smile of his  as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping 
436,you fancied you had seen things  but the seal was on 
437,when annoyed at meal times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence  he ordered an immense round table to be made  for which a special house had to be built 
438,this was the station own mess room 
439,where he sat was the first place  the rest were nowhere  one felt this to be his unalterable conviction  he was neither civil nor uncivil  he was quiet  he allowed his  boy   an overfed young negro from the coast  to treat the white men  under his very eyes  with provoking insolence 
440, he began to speak as soon as he saw me  had been very long on the road 
441,he could not wait 
442,had to start without me 
443,the up river stations had to be relieved 
444,there had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive  and how they got on  and so on  and so on 
445,he paid no attention to my explanations  and  playing with a stick of sealing wax  repeated several times that the situation was  very grave  very grave  
446,there were rumors that a very important station was in jeopardy  and its chief  mr  kurtz  was ill 
447,hoped it was not true 
448,mr  kurtz was       felt weary and irritable 
449,hang kurtz  thought 
450,interrupted him by saying had heard of mr  kurtz on the coast 
451, ah  so they talk of him down there   he murmured to himself 
452,then he began again  assuring me mr  kurtz was the best agent he had  an exceptional man  of the greatest importance to the company  therefore could understand his anxiety 
453,he was  he said   very  very uneasy  
454,certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal  exclaimed   ah  mr  kurtz   broke the stick of sealing wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident 
455,next thing he wanted to know  how long it would take to        interrupted him again 
456,being hungry  you know  and kept on my feet too  was getting savage 
457, how could tell   said 
458, had not even seen the wreck yet  some months  no doubt  
459,all this talk seemed to me so futile 
460, ownome months   he said 
461, well  let us say three months before we can make a start  yes  that ought to do the affair   flung out of his hut  he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda  muttering to myself my opinion of him 
462,he was a chattering idiot 
463,afterwards took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the  affair  
464, went to work the next day  turning  so to speak  my back on that station 
465,in that way only it seemed to me could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life 
466,still  one must look about sometimes  and then saw this station  these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard 
467,asked myself sometimes what it all meant 
468,they wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands  like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence 
469,the word  ivory  rang in the air  was whispered  was sighed 
470,you would think they were praying to it 
471,a taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all  like a whiff from some corpse 
472,by jove 
473,I have never seen anything so unreal in my life 
474,and outside  the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible  like evil or truth  waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion 
475, oh  these months 
476,well  never mind 
477,various things happened 
478,one evening a grass she would full of calico  cotton prints  beads  and do not know what else  burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash 
479,was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer  and saw them all cutting capers in the light  with their arms lifted high  when the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river  a tin pail in his hand  assured me that everybody was  behaving splendidly  splendidly   dipped about a quart of water and tore back again 
480,noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail 
481, strolled up 
482,there was no hurry 
483,you see the thing had gone off like a box of matches 
484,it had been hopeless from the very first 
485,the flame had leaped high  driven everybody back  lighted up everything  and collapsed  the she would was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely  a nigger was being beaten near by  they said he had caused the fire in some way  be that as it may  he was screeching most horribly  saw him  later on  for several days  sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself  afterwards he arose and went out  and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again 
486,as approached the glow from the dark found myself at the back of two men  talking 
487,heard the name of kurtz pronounced  then the words   take advantage of this unfortunate accident  
488,one of the men was the manager 
489,wished him a good evening 
490, did you ever see anything like it  eh  it is incredible   he said  and walked off 
491,the other man remained 
492,he was a first class agent  young  gentlemanly  a bit reserved  with a forked little beard and a hooked nose 
493,he was stand offish with the other agents  and they on their side said he was the manager own spy upon them 
494,as to me  had hardly ever spoken to him before 
495,we got into talk  and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins 
496,then he asked me to his room  which was in the main building of the station 
497,he struck a match  and perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver mounted dressing case but also a whole candle all to himself 
498,just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles 
499,native mats covered the clay walls  a collection of spears  assegais  shields  knives was hung up in trophies 
500,the business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks  so had been informed  but there was not a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station  and he had been there more than a year  waiting 
501,it seems he could not make bricks without something  do not know what  straw maybe  anyways  it could not be found there  and as it was not likely to be sent from europe  it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for  an act of special creation perhaps  however  they were all waiting  all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them  for something  and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation  from the way they took it  though the only thing that ever came to them was disease  as far as could see 
502,they beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way 
503,there was an air of plotting about that station  but nothing came of it  of course 
504,it was as unreal as everything else  as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern  as their talk  as their government  as their show of work 
505,the only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading post where ivory was to be had  so that they could earn percentages 
506,they intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account   but as to effectually lifting a little finger  oh  no 
507,by heavens  there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter 
508,steal a horse straight out 
509,very well 
510,he has done it 
511,perhaps he can ride 
512,but there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick 
513, had no idea why he wanted to be sociable  but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something  in fact  pumping me  he alluded constantly to europe  to the people was supposed to know there  putting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city  and so on 
514,his little eyes glittered like mica discs  with curiosity   though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness 
515,at first was astonished  but very soon became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me  could not possibly imagine what had in me to make it worth his while 
516,it was very pretty to see how he baffled himself  for in truth my body was full of chills  and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business 
517,it was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator 
518,at last he got angry  and to conceal a movement of furious annoyance  he yawned 
519,rose 
520,then noticed a small sketch in oils  on a panel  representing a woman  draped and blindfolded  carrying a lighted torch 
521,the background was somber  almost black 
522,the movement of the woman was stately  and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister 
523, it arrested me  and he stood by civilly  holding a half pint champagne bottle  medical comforts  with the candle stuck in it 
524,to my question he said mr  kurtz had painted this  in this very station more than a year ago  while waiting for means to go to his trading post 
525, tell me  pray   said i   who is this mr  kurtz  
526,  the chief of the inner station   he answered in a short tone  looking away 
527, much obliged   said  laughing 
528, and you are the brickmaker of the central station  everyone knows that  
529,he was silent for a while 
530, he is a prodigy   he said at last 
531, he is an emissary of pity  and science  and progress  and devil knows what else  we want   he began to declaim suddenly   for the guidance of the because intrusted to us by europe  so to speak  higher intelligence  wide sympathies  a singleness of purpose    who says that   asked 
532, lots of them   he replied 
533, ownome even write that  and so  he  comes here  a special being  as you ought to know    why ought to know   interrupted  really surprised 
534,he paid no attention 
535, yes  to day he is chief of the best station  next year he will be assistant manager  two years more and       but dare say you know what he will be in two years  time 
536,you are of the new gang  the gang of virtue 
537,the same people who sent him specially also recommended you 
538,oh  do not say no 
539,I have my own eyes to trust 
540,  light dawned upon me 
541,my dear aunt own influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man  nearly burst into a laugh 
542, do you read the company own confidential correspondence   asked 
543,he had not a word to say 
544,it was great fun 
545, when mr  kurtz   continued severely   is general manager  you will not have the opportunity  
546, he blew the candle out suddenly  and we went outside 
547,the moon had risen 
548,black figures strolled about listlessly  pouring water on the glow  whence proceeded a sound of hissing  steam ascended in the moonlight  the beaten nigger groaned somewhere 
549, what a row the brute makes   said the indefatigable man with the mustaches  appearing near us 
550, ownerve him right  transgression  punishment  bang  pitiless  pitiless  that is the only way  this will prevent all conflagrations for the future  was just telling the manager       
551,he noticed my companion  and became crestfallen all at once 
552, not in bed yet   he said  with a kind of servile heartiness   it is so natural  ha  danger  agitation  
553,he vanished 
554,went on to the river side  and the other followed me  heard a scathing murmur at my ear   heap of muffs  go to   the pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating  discussing  several had still their staves in their hands  verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them  beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight  and through the dim stir  through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard  the silence of the land went home to one own very heart   its mystery  its greatness  the amazing reality of its concealed life 
555,the hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by  and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there 
556,felt a hand introducing itself under my arm 
557, my dear sir   said the fellow   do not want to be misunderstood  and especially by you  who will see mr  kurtz long before can have that pleasure  would not like him to get a false idea of my disposition        
558, let him run on  this  papier mache  mephistopheles  and it seemed to me that if tried could poke my forefinger through him  and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt  maybe  he  do not you see  had been planning to be assistant manager by and by under the present man  and could see that the coming of that kurtz had upset them both not a little  he talked precipitately  and did not try to stop him  had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer  hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal  the smell of mud  of primeval mud  by jove  was in my nostrils  the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes  there were shiny patches on the black creek  the moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver  over the rank grass  over the mud  upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple  over the great river could see through a somber gap glittering  glittering  as it flowed broadly by without a murmur  all this was great  expectant  mute  while the man jabbered about himself  wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace  what were we who had strayed in here  could we handle that dumb thing  or would it handle us  felt how big  how confoundedly big  was that thing that could not talk  and perhaps was deaf as well  what was in there  could see a little ivory coming out from there  and had heard mr  kurtz was in there  had heard enough about it too  god knows  yet somehow it did not bring any image with it  no more than if had been told an angel or a fiend was in there  believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet mars  knew once a scotch sailmaker who was certain  dead sure  there were people in mars  if you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved  he would get shy and mutter something about  walking on all fours   if you as much as smiled  he would  though a man of sixty  offer to fight you  would not have gone so far as to fight for kurtz  but went for him near enough to a lie  you know hate  detest  and cannot bear a lie  not because am straighter than the rest of us  but simply because it appalls me  there is a taint of death  a flavor of mortality in lies   which is exactly what hate and detest in the world  what want to forget  it makes me miserable and sick  like biting something rotten would do  temperament  suppose  well  went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in europe  became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims  this simply because had a notion it somehow would be of help to that kurtz whom at the time did not see  you understand  he was just a word for me  did not see the man in the name any more than you do  do you see him  do you see the story  do you see anything  it seems to me am trying to tell you a dream  making a vain attempt  because no relation of a dream can convey the dream sensation  that commingling of absurdity  surprise  and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt  that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams        
559,he was silent for a while 
560,       no  it is impossible  it is impossible to convey the life sensation of any given epoch of one own existence   that which makes its truth  its meaning  its subtle and penetrating essence  it is impossible  we live  as we dream  alone        
561,he paused again as if reflecting  then added   of course in this you fellows see more than could then  you see me  whom you know        
562,it had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another 
563,for a long time already he  sitting apart  had been no more to us than a voice 
564,there was not a word from anybody 
565,the others might have been asleep  but was awake 
566,listened  listened on the watch for the sentence  for the word  that would give me the clew to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night air of the river 
567,       yes  let him run on   marlow began again   and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me  did  and there was nothing behind me  there was nothing but that wretched  old  mangled steamboat was leaning against  while he talked fluently about  the necessity for every man to get on    and when one comes out here  you conceive  it is not to gaze at the moon   mr  kurtz was a  universal genius   but even a genius would find it easier to work with  adequate tools  intelligent men  
568,he did not make bricks  why  there was a physical impossibility in the way  as was well aware  and if he did secretarial work for the manager  it was because  no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors  
569,did see it 
570,saw it 
571,what more did want 
572,what really wanted was rivets  by heaven 
573,rivets 
574,to get on with the work  to stop the hole  rivets wanted  there were cases of them down at the coast  cases  piled up  burst  split  you kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside  rivets had rolled into the grove of death  you could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down  and there was not one rivet to be found where it was wanted 
575,we had plates that would do  but nothing to fasten them with 
576,and every week the messenger  a lone negro  letter bag on shoulder and staff in hand  left our station for the coast 
577,and several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods   ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it  glass beads value about a penny a quart  confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs 
578,and no rivets 
579,three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat 
580, he was becoming confidential now  but fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last  for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither god nor devil  let alone any mere man  said could see that very well  but what wanted was a certain quantity of rivets  and rivets were what really mr  kurtz wanted  if he had only known it  now letters went to the coast every week         my dear sir   he cried   write from dictation   demanded rivets  there was a way  for an intelligent man 
581,he changed his manner  became very cold  and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus  wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer  stuck to my salvage night and day  was not disturbed 
582,there was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds 
583,the pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him 
584,some even had sat up of nights for him 
585,all this energy was wasted  though 
586, that animal has a charmed life   he said   but you can say this only of brutes in this country  no man  you apprehend me   no man here bears a charmed life  
587,he stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew  and his mica eyes glittering without a wink  then  with a curt good night  he strode off 
588,could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled  which made me feel more hopeful than had been for days 
589,it was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend  the battered  twisted  ruined  tin pot steamboat 
590,clambered on board 
591,she rang under my feet like an empty huntley   palmer biscuit tin kicked along a gutter  she was nothing so solid in make  and rather less pretty in shape  but had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her 
592,no influential friend would have served me better 
593,she had given me a chance to come out a bit  to find out what could do  no  do not like work  had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done  do not like work  no man does  but like what is in the work   the chance to find yourself 
594,your own reality  for yourself  not for others  what no other man can ever know 
595,they can only see the mere show  and never can tell what it really means 
596, was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft  on the deck  with his legs dangling over the mud 
597,you see rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station  whom the other pilgrims naturally despised  on account of their imperfect manners  suppose  this was the foreman  a boiler maker by trade  a good worker 
598,he was a lank  bony  yellow faced man  with big intense eyes 
599,his aspect was worried  and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand  but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin  and had prospered in the new locality  for his beard hung down to his waist 
600,he was a widower with six young children  he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there   and the passion of his life was pigeon flying 
601,he was an enthusiast and a connoisseur 
602,he would rave about pigeons 
603,after work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons  at work  when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat  he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose 
604,it had loops to go over his ears 
605,in the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care  then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry 
606, slapped him on the back and shouted   we shall have rivets  
607,he scrambled to his feet exclaiming  no  rivets   as though he could not believe his ears 
608,then in a low voice   you       eh   do not know why we behaved like lunatics 
609,put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously 
610, good for you   he cried  snapped his fingers above his head  lifting one foot 
611,tried a jig 
612,we capered on the iron deck 
613,a frightful clatter came out of that hulk  and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station 
614,it must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels 
615,a dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager own hut  vanished  then  a second or so after  the doorway itself vanished too 
616,we stopped  and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land 
617,the great wall of vegetation  an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks  branches  leaves  boughs  festoons  motionless in the moonlight  was like a rioting invasion of soundless life  a rolling wave of plants  piled up  crested  ready to topple over the creek  to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence 
618,and it moved not 
619,a deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar  as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river 
620, after all   said the boiler maker in a reasonable tone   why should not we get the rivets  
621,why not  indeed  did not know of any reason why we should not 
622, they will come in three weeks   said confidently 
623, but they did not 
624,instead of rivets there came an invasion  an infliction  a visitation 
625,it came in sections during the next three weeks  each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes  bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims 
626,a quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkeys  a lot of tents  camp stools  tin boxes  white cases  brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard  and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station 
627,five such installments came  with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores  that  one would think  they were lugging  after a raid  into the wilderness for equitable division 
628,it was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving 
629, this devoted band called itself the eldorado exploring expedition  and believe they were sworn to secrecy 
630,their talk  however  was the talk of sordid buccaneers  it was reckless without hardihood  greedy without audacity  and cruel without courage  there was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them  and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world 
631,to tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire  with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe 
632,who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise do not know  but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot 
633, in exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighborhood  and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning 
634,he carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs  and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew 
635,you could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab 
636, had given up worrying myself about the rivets  one own capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose  said hang   and let things slide  had plenty of time for meditation  and now and then would give some thought to kurtz  was not very interested in him  no  still  was curious to see whether this man  who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort  would climb to the top after all  and how he would set about his work when there  
637, one evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat  i heard voices approaching  and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank  i laid my head on my arm again  and had nearly lost myself in a doze  when somebody said in my ear  as it were   i am as harmless as a little child  but i do not like to be dictated to  am i the manager  or am i not  i was ordered to send him there  it is incredible         i became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat  just below my head  i did not move  it did not occur to me to move  i was sleepy   it  is  unpleasant   grunted the uncle   he has asked the administration to be sent there   said the other   with the idea of showing what he could do  and i was instructed accordingly  look at the influence that man must have  is it not frightful   they both agreed it was frightful  then made several bizarre remarks   make rain and fine weather  one man  the council  by the nose   bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness  so that i had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said   the climate may do away with this difficulty for you  is he alone there    yes   answered the manager   he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms   clear this poor devil out of the country  and do not bother sending more of that sort  i had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me  
638,it was more than a year ago  can you imagine such impudence    anything since then   asked the other  hoarsely 
639, ivory   jerked the nephew   lots of it  prime sort  lots  most annoying  from him    and with that   questioned the heavy rumble 
640, invoice   was the reply fired out  so to speak 
641,then silence 
642,they had been talking about kurtz 
643, i was broad awake by this time  but  lying perfectly at ease  remained still  having no inducement to change my position   how did that ivory come all this way   growled the elder man  who seemed very vexed  the other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an english half caste clerk kurtz had with him  that kurtz had apparently intended to return himself  the station being by that time bare of goods and stores  but after coming three hundred miles  had suddenly decided to go back  which he started to do alone in a small dug out with four paddlers  leaving the half caste to continue down the river with the ivory  the two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing  they were at a loss for an adequate motive  as to me  i seemed to see kurtz for the first time  it was a distinct glimpse  the dug out  four paddling savages  and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters  on relief  on thoughts of home  perhaps  setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness  towards his empty and desolate station  i did not know the motive  perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake  his name  you understand  had not been pronounced once  he was  that man   the half caste  who  as far as i could see  had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck  was invariably alluded to as  that scoundrel   the  owncoundrel  had reported that the  man  had been very ill  had recovered imperfectly        the two below me moved away then a few paces  and strolled back and forth at some little distance  i heard   military post  doctor  two hundred miles  quite alone now  unavoidable delays  nine months  no news  strange rumors   they approached again  just as the manager was saying   no one  as far as i know  unless a species of wandering trader  a pestilential fellow  snapping ivory from the natives   who was it they were talking about now  i gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in kurtz own district  and of whom the manager did not approve   we will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example   he said   certainly   grunted the other   get him hanged  why not  anything  anything can be done in this country  that is what i say  nobody here  you understand   here   can endanger your position  and why  you stand the climate  you outlast them all  the danger is in europe  but there before i left i took care to    they moved off and whispered  then their voices rose again   the extraordinary series of delays is not my fault  i did my possible   the fat man sighed   very sad    and the pestiferous absurdity of his talk   continued the other   he bothered me enough when he was here   each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things  a center for trade of course  but also for humanizing  improving  instructing  
644,conceive you  that ass  and he wants to be manager  no  it is   
645,here he got choked by excessive indignation  and i lifted my head the least bit 
646,i was surprised to see how near they were  right under me  i could have spat upon their hats  they were looking on the ground  absorbed in thought  the manager was switching his leg with a slender twig  his sagacious relative lifted his head   you have been well since you came out this time   he asked  the other gave a start   who  i  oh  like a charm  like a charm  but the rest  oh  my goodness  all sick  they die so quick  too  that i have not the time to send them out of the country  it is incredible    h m  just so   grunted the uncle 
647, ah  my boy  trust to this  i say  trust to this   i saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest  the creek  the mud  the river   seemed to beckon with a dishonoring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death  to the hidden evil  to the profound darkness of its heart 
648,it was so startling that i leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest  as though i had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence 
649,you know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes 
650,the high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience  waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion 
651, they swore aloud together  out of sheer fright  i believe  then pretending not to know anything of my existence  turned back to the station 
652,the sun was low  and leaning forward side by side  they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length  that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade 
653, in a few days the eldorado expedition went into the patient wilderness  that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver 
654,long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead 
655,i know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals 
656,they  no doubt  like the rest of us  found what they deserved 
657,i did not inquire 
658,i was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting kurtz very soon 
659,when i say very soon i mean it comparatively 
660,it was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below kurtz own station 
661, going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world  when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings  an empty stream  a great silence  an impenetrable forest  the air was warm  thick  heavy  sluggish  there was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine  the long stretches of the waterway ran on  deserted  into the gloom of overshadowed distances  on silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side  the broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands  you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert  and butted all day long against shoals  trying to find the channel  till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once  somewhere  far away  in another existence perhaps  there were moments when one own past came back to one  as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself  but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream  remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants  and water  and silence  and this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace  it was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention  it looked at you with a vengeful aspect  i got used to it afterwards  i did not see it any more  i had no time  i had to keep guessing at the channel  i had to discern  mostly by inspiration  the signs of hidden banks  i watched for sunken stones  i was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out  when i shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims  i had to keep a look out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day own steaming  when you have to attend to things of that sort  to the mere incidents of the surface  the reality  the reality  i tell you  fades  the inner truth is hidden  luckily  luckily  but i felt it all the same  i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks  just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight ropes for  what is it  half a crown a tumble   
662, try to be civil  marlow   growled a voice  and i knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself 
663, i beg your pardon 
664,i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price 
665,and indeed what does the price matter  if the trick be well done 
666,you do your tricks very well 
667,and i did not do badly either  since i managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip 
668,it is a wonder to me yet 
669,imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road 
670,i sweated and shivered over that business considerably  i can tell you 
671,after all  for a seaman  to scrape the bottom of the thing that is supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin 
672,no one may know of it  but you never forget the thump  eh  a blow on the very heart  you remember it  you dream of it  you wake up at night and think of it  years after  and go hot and cold all over  i do not pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time  more than once she had to wade for a bit  with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing  we had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew  fine fellows  cannibals  in their place 
673,they were men one could work with  and i am grateful to them 
674,and  after all  they did not eat each other before my face  they had brought along a provision of hippo meat which went rotten  and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils 
675,phoo 
676,i can sniff it now 
677,i had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves  all complete 
678,sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank  clinging to the skirts of the unknown  and the white men rushing out of a tumble down hovel  with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome  seemed very strange   had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell  the word ivory would ring in the air for a while  and on we went again into the silence  along empty reaches  round the still bends  between the high walls of our winding way  reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern wheel 
679,trees  trees  millions of trees  massive  immense  running up high  and at their foot  hugging the bank against the stream  crept the little begrimed steamboat  like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico 
680,it made you feel very small  very lost  and yet it was not altogether depressing  that feeling 
681,after all  if you were small  the grimy beetle crawled on  which was just what you wanted it to do  where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to i do not know  to some place where they expected to get something  i bet  for me it crawled toward kurtz  exclusively  but when the steam pipes started leaking we crawled very slow 
682,the reaches opened before us and closed behind  as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return 
683,we penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness 
684,it was very quiet there 
685,at night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly  as if hovering in the air high over our heads  till the first break of day 
686,whether it meant war  peace  or prayer we could not tell 
687,the dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness  the woodcutters slept  their fires burned low  the snapping of a twig would make you start 
688,we were wanderers on a prehistoric earth  on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet 
689,we could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance  to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil 
690,but suddenly  as we struggled round a bend  there would be a glimpse of rush walls  of peaked grass roofs  a burst of yells  a whirl of black limbs  a mass of hands clapping  of feet stamping  of bodies swaying  of eyes rolling  under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage 
691,the steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy 
692,the prehistoric man was cursing us  praying to us  welcoming us  who could tell  we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings  we glided past like phantoms  wondering and secretly appalled  as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse  we could not understand  because we were too far and could not remember  because we were traveling in the night of first ages  of those ages that are gone  leaving hardly a sign  and no memories 
693, the earth seemed unearthly 
694,we are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster  but there  there you could look at a thing monstrous and free  it was unearthly  and the men were  no  they were not inhuman 
695,well  you know  that was the worst of it  this suspicion of their not being inhuman  it would come slowly to one  they howled  and leaped  and spun  and made horrid faces  but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity  like yours  the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar  ugly  yes  it was ugly enough  but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise  a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you  you so remote from the night of first ages  could comprehend  and why not  the mind of man is capable of anything  because everything is in it  all the past as well as all the future 
696,what was there after all 
697,joy  fear  sorrow  devotion  valor  rage  who can tell   but truth  truth stripped of its cloak of time  let the fool gape and shudder  the man knows  and can look on without a wink 
698,but he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore 
699,he must meet that truth with his own true stuff  with his own inborn strength  principles  principles will not do  acquisitions  clothes  pretty rags  rags that would fly off at the first good shake 
700,no  you want a deliberate belief 
701,an appeal to me in this fiendish row  is there  very well  i hear  i admit  but i have a voice too  and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced  of course  a fool  what with sheer fright and fine sentiments  is always safe  who is that grunting  you wonder i did not go ashore for a howl and a dance  well  no  i did not 
702,fine sentiments  you say 
703,fine sentiments  be hanged 
704,i had no time 
705,i had to mess about with white lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam pipes  i tell you 
706,i had to watch the steering  and circumvent those snags  and get the tin pot along by hook or by crook 
707,there was surface truth enough in these things to save a wiser man 
708,and between whiles i had to look after the savage who was fireman 
709,he was an improved specimen  he could fire up a vertical boiler 
710,he was there below me  and  upon my word  to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat  walking on his hind legs 
711,a few months of training had done for that really fine chap 
712,he squinted at the steam gauge and at the water gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity  and he had filed teeth too  the poor devil  and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns  and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks  he ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank  instead of which he was hard at work  a thrall to strange witchcraft  full of improving knowledge  he was useful because he had been instructed  and what he knew was this  that should the water in that transparent thing disappear  the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst  and take a terrible vengeance 
713,so he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully  with an impromptu charm  made of rags  tied to his arm  and a piece of polished bone  as big as a watch  stuck flatways through his lower lip   while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly  the short noise was left behind  the interminable miles of silence  and we crept on  towards kurtz 
714,but the snags were thick  the water was treacherous and shallow  the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it  and thus neither that fireman nor i had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts 
715, some fifty miles below the inner station we came upon a hut of reeds  an inclined and melancholy pole  with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it  and a neatly stacked woodpile 
716,this was unexpected 
717,we came to the bank  and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil writing on it 
718,when deciphered it said   wood for you  hurry up  approach cautiously  
719,there was a signature  but it was illegible  not kurtz  a much longer word 
720, hurry up  
721,where 
722,up the river 
723, approach cautiously  
724,we had not done so 
725,but the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach 
726,something was wrong above 
727,but what  and how much  that was the question  we commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style  the bush around said nothing  and would not let us look very far  either  a torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut  and flapped sadly in our faces  the dwelling was dismantled  but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago  there remained a rude table  a plank on two posts  a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner  and by the door i picked up a book 
728,it had lost its covers  and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness  but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread  which looked clean yet 
729,it was an extraordinary find 
730,its title was   an inquiry into some points of seamanship   by a man tower  towson  some such name  master in his majesty own navy 
731,the matter looked dreary reading enough  with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures  and the copy was sixty years old 
732,i handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness  lest it should dissolve in my hands 
733,within  towson or towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships  chains and tackle  and other such matters 
734,not a very enthralling book  but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention  an honest concern for the right way of going to work  which made these humble pages  thought out so many years ago  luminous with another than a professional light 
735,the simple old sailor  with his talk of chains and purchases  made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real 
736,such a book being there was wonderful enough  but still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin  and plainly referring to the text 
737,i could not believe my eyes 
738,they were in cipher 
739,yes  it looked like cipher 
740,fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying it  and making notes  in cipher at that 
741,it was an extravagant mystery 
742, i had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise  and when i lifted my eyes i saw the wood pile was gone  and the manager  aided by all the pilgrims  was shouting at me from the river side 
743,i slipped the book into my pocket 
744,i assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship 
745, i started the lame engine ahead 
746, it must be this miserable trader  this intruder   exclaimed the manager  looking back malevolently at the place we had left 
747, he must be english   i said 
748, it will not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful   muttered the manager darkly 
749,i observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world 
750, the current was more rapid now  the steamer seemed at her last gasp  the stern wheel flopped languidly  and i caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat  for in sober truth i expected the wretched thing to give up every moment 
751,it was like watching the last flickers of a life 
752,but still we crawled 
753,sometimes i would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards kurtz by  but i lost it invariably before we got abreast 
754,to keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience 
755,the manager displayed a beautiful resignation 
756,i fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no i would talk openly with kurtz  but before i could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence  indeed any action of mine  would be a mere futility 
757,what did it matter what anyone knew or ignored 
758,what did it matter who was manager 
759,one gets sometimes such a flash of insight 
760,the essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface  beyond my reach  and beyond my power of meddling 
761, towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from kurtz own station 
762,i wanted to push on  but the manager looked grave  and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable  the sun being very low already  to wait where we were till next morning 
763,moreover  he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed  we must approach in daylight  not at dusk  or in the dark  this was sensible enough  eight miles meant nearly three hours  steaming for us  and i could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach  nevertheless  i was annoyed beyond expression at the delay  and most unreasonably too  since one night more could not matter much after so many months  as we had plenty of wood  and caution was the word  i brought up in the middle of the stream  the reach was narrow  straight  with high sides like a railway cutting  the dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set  the current ran smooth and swift  but a dumb immobility sat on the banks  the living trees  lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth  might have been changed into stone  even to the slenderest twig  to the lightest leaf  it was not sleep  it seemed unnatural  like a state of trance 
764,not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard 
765,you looked on amazed  and began to suspect yourself of being deaf  then the night came suddenly  and struck you blind as well  about three in the morning some large fish leaped  and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired  when the sun rose there was a white fog  very warm and clammy  and more blinding than the night  it did not shift or drive  it was just there  standing all round you like something solid  at eight or nine  perhaps  it lifted as a shutter lifts  we had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees  of the immense matted jungle  with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it  all perfectly still  and then the white shutter came down again  smoothly  as if sliding in greased grooves  i ordered the chain  which we had begun to heave in  to be paid out again  before it stopped running with a muffled rattle  a cry  a very loud cry  as of infinite desolation  soared slowly in the opaque air  it ceased  a complaining clamor  modulated in savage discords  filled our ears  the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap  i do not know how it struck the others  to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed  so suddenly  and apparently from all sides at once  did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise  it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking  which stopped short  leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes  and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence   good god  what is the meaning     stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims   a little fat man  with sandy hair and red whiskers  who wore side spring boots  and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks 
766,two others remained open mouthed a whole minute  then dashed into the little cabin  to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances  with winchesters at  ready  in their hands 
767,what we could see was just the steamer we were on  her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving  and a misty strip of water  perhaps two feet broad  around her  and that was all 
768,the rest of the world was nowhere  as far as our eyes and ears were concerned 
769,just nowhere 
770,gone  disappeared  swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind 
771, i went forward  and ordered the chain to be hauled in short  so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary 
772, will they attack   whispered an awed voice 
773, we will all be butchered in this fog   murmured another 
774,the faces twitched with the strain  the hands trembled slightly  the eyes forgot to wink 
775,it was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew  who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we  though their homes were only eight hundred miles away 
776,the whites  of course greatly discomposed  had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row 
777,the others had an alert  naturally interested expression  but their faces were essentially quiet  even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain 
778,several exchanged short  grunting phrases  which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction 
779,their headman  a young  broad chested black  severely draped in dark blue fringed cloths  with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets  stood near me 
780, aha  
781,i said  just for good fellowship own sake 
782, catch  I am   he snapped  with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth   catch  I am  give  I am to us    to you  eh   i asked   what would you do with them    eat  I am   he said curtly  and  leaning his elbow on the rail  looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude  i would no doubt have been properly horrified  had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry  that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past  they had been engaged for six months  i do not think a single one of them had any clear idea of time  as we at the end of countless ages have  they still belonged to the beginnings of time  had no inherited experience to teach them as it were   and of course  as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river  it did not enter anybody own head to trouble how they would live 
783,certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo meat  which could not have lasted very long  anyway  even if the pilgrims had not  in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo  thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard 
784,it looked like a high handed proceeding  but it was really a case of legitimate self defense 
785,you cannot breathe dead hippo waking  sleeping  and eating  and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence 
786,besides that  they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire  each about nine inches long  and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in river side villages 
787,you can see how  that  worked 
788,there were either no villages  or the people were hostile  or the director  who like the rest of us fed out of tins  with an occasional old he goat thrown in  did not want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason 
789,so  unless they swallowed the wire itself  or made loops of it to snare the fishes with  i do not see what good their extravagant salary could be to them 
790,i must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company 
791,for the rest  the only thing to eat  though it did not look eatable in the least  i saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half cooked dough  of a dirty lavender color  they kept wrapped in leaves  and now and then swallowed a piece of  but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance 
792,why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they did not go for us  they were thirty to five  and have a good tuck in for once  amazes me now when i think of it 
793,they were big powerful men  with not much capacity to weigh the consequences  with courage  with strength  even yet  though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard 
794,and i saw that something restraining  one of those human secrets that baffle probability  had come into play there 
795,i looked at them with a swift quickening of interest  not because it occurred to me i might be eaten by them before very long  though i own to you that just then i perceived  in a new light  as it were  how unwholesome the pilgrims looked  and i hoped  yes  i positively hoped  that my aspect was not so  what shall i say   so  unappetizing  a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream sensation that pervaded all my days at that time 
796,perhaps i had a little fever too 
797,one cannot live with one own finger everlastingly on one own pulse 
798,i had often  a little fever   or a little touch of other things  the playful paw strokes of the wilderness  the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course 
799,yes  i looked at them as you would on any human being  with a curiosity of their impulses  motives  capacities  weaknesses  when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity 
800,restraint 
801,what possible restraint 
802,was it superstition  disgust  patience  fear  or some kind of primitive honor  no fear can stand up to hunger  no patience can wear it out  disgust simply does not exist where hunger is  and as to superstition  beliefs  and what you may call principles  they are less than chaff in a breeze  do not you know the devilry of lingering starvation  its exasperating torment  its black thoughts  its somber and brooding ferocity  well  i do  it takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly  it is really easier to face bereavement  dishonor  and the perdition of one own soul  than this kind of prolonged hunger 
803,sad  but true 
804,and these chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple 
805,restraint 
806,i would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield 
807,but there was the fact facing me  the fact dazzling  to be seen  like the foam on the depths of the sea  like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma  a mystery greater  when i thought of it  than the curious  inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamor that had swept by us on the river bank  behind the blind whiteness of the fog 
808, two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers as to which bank 
809, left    no  no  how can you  right  right  of course    it is very serious   said the manager own voice behind me   i would be desolated if anything should happen to mr  kurtz before we came up  
810,i looked at him  and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere 
811,he was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances 
812,that was his restraint 
813,but when he muttered something about going on at once  i did not even take the trouble to answer him 
814,i knew  and he knew  that it was impossible 
815,were we to let go our hold of the bottom  we would be absolutely in the air  in space  we would not be able to tell where we were going to  whether up or down stream  or across  till we fetched against one bank or the other   and then we would not know at first which it was 
816,of course i made no move 
817,i had no mind for a smash up 
818,you could not imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck 
819,whether drowned at once or not  we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another 
820, i authorize you to take all the risks   he said  after a short silence 
821, i refuse to take any   i said shortly  which was just the answer he expected  though its tone might have surprised him 
822, well  i must defer to your judgment  you are captain   he said  with marked civility 
823,i turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation  and looked into the fog 
824,how long would it last 
825,it was the most hopeless look out 
826,the approach to this kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle 
827, will they attack  do you think   asked the manager  in a confidential tone 
828, i did not think they would attack  for several obvious reasons 
829,the thick fog was one 
830,if they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it  as we would be if we attempted to move 
831,still  i had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable  and yet eyes were in it  eyes that had seen us 
832,the river side bushes were certainly very thick  but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable 
833,however  during the short lift i had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach  certainly not abreast of the steamer  but what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise  of the cries we had heard 
834,they had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile intention 
835,unexpected  wild  and violent as they had been  they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow 
836,the glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief 
837,the danger  if any  i expounded  was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose 
838,even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence  but more generally takes the form of apathy       
839, you should have seen the pilgrims stare 
840,they had no heart to grin  or even to revile me  but i believe they thought me gone mad  with fright  maybe 
841,i delivered a regular lecture 
842,my dear boys  it was no good bothering 
843,keep a look out 
844,well  you may guess i watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse  but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton wool 
845,it felt like it too  choking  warm  stifling  besides  all i said  though it sounded extravagant  was absolutely true to fact  what we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse  the action was very far from being aggressive  it was not even defensive  in the usual sense  it was undertaken under the stress of desperation  and in its essence was purely protective 
846, it developed itself  i should say  two hours after the fog lifted  and its commencement was at a spot  roughly speaking  about a mile and a half below kurtz own station 
847,we had just floundered and flopped round a bend  when i saw an islet  a mere grassy hummock of bright green  in the middle of the stream 
848,it was the only thing of the kind  but as we opened the reach more  i perceived it was the head of a long sandbank  or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river 
849,they were discolored  just awash  and the whole lot was seen just under the water  exactly as a man own backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin 
850,now  as far as i did see  i could go to the right or to the left of this 
851,i did not know either channel  of course 
852,the banks looked pretty well alike  the depth appeared the same  but as i had been informed the station was on the west side  i naturally headed for the western passage 
853, no sooner had we fairly entered it than i became aware it was much narrower than i had supposed 
854,to the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal  and to the right a high  steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes 
855,above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks 
856,the twigs overhung the current thickly  and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream 
857,it was then well on in the afternoon  the face of the forest was gloomy  and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water 
858,in this shadow we steamed up  very slowly  as you may imagine  i sheered her well inshore  the water being deepest near the bank  as the sounding pole informed me 
859, one of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me 
860,this steamboat was exactly like a decked scow 
861,on the deck there were two little teak wood houses  with doors and windows 
862,the boiler was in the fore end  and the machinery right astern 
863,over the whole there was a light roof  supported on stanchions 
864,the funnel projected through that roof  and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot house 
865,it contained a couch  two camp stools  a loaded martini henry leaning in one corner  a tiny table  and the steering wheel 
866,it had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side 
867,all these were always thrown open  of course 
868,i spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore end of that roof  before the door 
869,at night i slept  or tried to  on the couch 
870,an athletic black belonging to some coast tribe  and educated by my poor predecessor  was the helmsman 
871,he sported a pair of brass earrings  wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles  and thought all the world of himself 
872,he was the most unstable kind of fool i had ever seen 
873,he steered with no end of a swagger while you were by  but if he lost sight of you  he became instantly the prey of an abject funk  and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute 
874, i was looking down at the sounding pole  and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river  when i saw my poleman give up the business suddenly  and stretch himself flat on the deck  without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in 
875,he kept hold on it though  and it trailed in the water 
876,at the same time the fireman  whom i could also see below me  sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head 
877,i was amazed 
878,then i had to look at the river mighty quick  because there was a snag in the fairway 
879,sticks  little sticks  were flying about  thick  they were whizzing before my nose  dropping below me  striking behind me against my pilot house 
880,all this time the river  the shore  the woods  were very quiet  perfectly quiet 
881,i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern wheel and the patter of these things 
882,we cleared the snag clumsily 
883,arrows  by jove 
884,we were being shot at 
885,i stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land side 
886,that fool helmsman  his hands on the spokes  was lifting his knees high  stamping his feet  champing his mouth  like a reined in horse 
887,confound him 
888,and we were staggering within ten feet of the bank 
889,i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter  and i saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own  looking at me very fierce and steady  and then suddenly  as though a veil had been removed from my eyes  i made out  deep in the tangled gloom  naked breasts  arms  legs  glaring eyes   the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement  glistening  of bronze color 
890,the twigs shook  swayed  and rustled  the arrows flew out of them  and then the shutter came to 
891, ownteer her straight   i said to the helmsman 
892,he held his head rigid  face forward  but his eyes rolled  he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently  his mouth foamed a little 
893, keep quiet  
894,i said in a fury 
895,i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind 
896,i darted out 
897,below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck  confused exclamations  a voice screamed   can you turn back  
898,i caught shape of a v shaped ripple on the water ahead 
899,what 
900,another snag 
901,a fusillade burst out under my feet 
902,the pilgrims had opened with their winchesters  and were simply squirting lead into that bush 
903,a deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward 
904,i swore at it 
905,now i could not see the ripple or the snag either 
906,i stood in the doorway  peering  and the arrows came in swarms 
907,they might have been poisoned  but they looked as though they would not kill a cat 
908,the bush began to howl 
909,our wood cutters raised a warlike whoop  the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me  i glanced over my shoulder  and the pilot house was yet full of noise and smoke when i made a dash at the wheel 
910,the fool nigger had dropped everything  to throw the shutter open and let off that martini henry 
911,he stood before the wide opening  glaring  and i yelled at him to come back  while i straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat 
912,there was no room to turn even if i had wanted to  the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke  there was no time to lose  so i just crowded her into the bank  right into the bank  where i knew the water was deep 
913, we tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves 
914,the fusillade below stopped short  as i had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty 
915,i threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot house  in at one shutter hole and out at the other 
916,looking past that mad helmsman  who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore  i saw vague forms of men running bent double  leaping  gliding  distinct  incomplete  evanescent 
917,something big appeared in the air before the shutter  the rifle went overboard  and the man stepped back swiftly  looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary  profound  familiar manner  and fell upon my feet 
918,the side of his head hit the wheel twice  and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp stool 
919,it looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort 
920,the thin smoke had blown away  we were clear of the snag  and looking ahead i could see that in another hundred yards or so i would be free to sheer off  away from the bank  but my feet felt so very warm and wet that i had to look down 
921,the man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me  both his hands clutched that cane 
922,it was the shaft of a spear that  either thrown or lunged through the opening  had caught him in the side just below the ribs  the blade had gone in out of sight  after making a frightful gash  my shoes were full  a pool of blood lay very still  gleaming dark red under the wheel  his eyes shone with an amazing luster 
923,the fusillade burst out again 
924,he looked at me anxiously  gripping the spear like something precious  with an air of being afraid i would try to take it away from him 
925,i had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering 
926,with one hand i felt above my head for the line of the steam whistle  and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly 
927,the tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly  and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth 
928,there was a great commotion in the bush  the shower of arrows stopped  a few dropping shots rang out sharply  then silence  in which the languid beat of the stern wheel came plainly to my ears 
929,i put the helm hard a starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas  very hot and agitated  appeared in the doorway 
930, the manager sends me    he began in an official tone  and stopped short 
931, good god   he said  glaring at the wounded man 
932, we two whites stood over him  and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both 
933,i declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some question in an understandable language  but he died without uttering a sound  without moving a limb  without twitching a muscle 
934,only in the very last moment  as though in response to some sign we could not see  to some whisper we could not hear  he frowned heavily  and that frown gave to his black death mask an inconceivably somber  brooding  and menacing expression 
935,the luster of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness 
936, can you steer  
937,i asked the agent eagerly 
938,he looked very dubious  but i made a grab at his arm  and he understood at once i meant him to steer whether or no 
939,to tell you the truth  i was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks 
940, he is dead   murmured the fellow  immensely impressed 
941, no doubt about it   said i  tugging like mad at the shoe laces 
942, and  by the way  i suppose mr  kurtz is dead as well by this time  
943, for the moment that was the dominant thought 
944,there was a sense of extreme disappointment  as though i had found out i had been striving after something altogether without a substance 
945,i could not have been more disgusted if i had traveled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with mr  kurtz 
946,talking with 
947,      i flung one shoe overboard  and became aware that that was exactly what i had been looking forward to  a talk with kurtz 
948,i made the strange discovery that i had never imagined him as doing  you know  but as discoursing 
949,i did not say to myself   now i will never see him   or  now i will never shake him by the hand   but   now i will never hear him  
950,the man presented himself as a voice 
951,not of course that i did not connect him with some sort of action 
952,had not i been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected  bartered  swindled  or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together 
953,that was not the point 
954,the point was in his being a gifted creature  and that of all his gifts the one that stood out pre eminently  that carried with it a sense of real presence  was his ability to talk  his words  the gift of expression  the bewildering  the illuminating  the most exalted and the most contemptible  the pulsating stream of light  or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness 
955, the other shoe went flying unto the devil god of that river  i thought   by jove  it is all over  we are too late  he has vanished  the gift has vanished  by means of some spear  arrow  or club  i will never hear that chap speak after all    and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion  even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush  i could not have felt more of lonely desolation somehow  had i been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life        why do you sigh in this beastly way  somebody  absurd  well  absurd  good lord  must not a man ever  here  give me some tobacco  
956,there was a pause of profound stillness  then a match flared  and marlow own lean face appeared  worn  hollow  with downward folds and dropped eyelids  with an aspect of concentrated attention  and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe  it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame 
957,the match went out 
958, absurd   he cried 
959, this is the worst of trying to tell        here you all are  each moored with two good addresses  like a hulk with two anchors  a butcher round one corner  a policeman round another  excellent appetites  and temperature normal  you hear  normal from year own end to year own end  and you say  absurd  absurd be  exploded  absurd  my dear boys  what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes  now i think of it  it is amazing i did not she would tears  i am  upon the whole  proud of my fortitude  i was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted kurtz  of course i was wrong  the privilege was waiting for me  oh yes  i heard more than enough  and i was right  too  a voice  he was very little more than a voice  and i heard  him  it  this voice  other voices  all of them were so little more than voices  and the memory of that time itself lingers around me  impalpable  like a dying vibration of one immense jabber  silly  atrocious  sordid  savage  or simply mean  without any kind of sense  voices  voices  even the girl herself  now   
960,he was silent for a long time 
961, i laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie   he began suddenly 
962, girl 
963,what 
964,did i mention a girl 
965,oh  she is out of it  completely  they  the women  i mean  are out of it  should be out of it 
966,we must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own  lest ours gets worse 
967,oh  she had to be out of it 
968,you should have heard the disinterred body of mr  kurtz saying   my intended  
969,you would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it 
970,and the lofty frontal bone of mr  kurtz 
971,they say the hair goes on growing sometimes  but this  ah specimen  was impressively bald  the wilderness had patted him on the head  and  behold  it was like a ball  an ivory ball  it had caressed him  and  lo   he had withered  it had taken him  loved him  embraced him  got into his veins  consumed his flesh  and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation 
972,he was its spoiled and pampered favorite 
973,ivory 
974,i should think so 
975,heaps of it  stacks of it 
976,the old mud shanty was bursting with it 
977,you would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below the ground in the whole country 
978, mostly fossil   the manager had remarked disparagingly 
979,it was no more fossil than i am  but they call it fossil when it is dug up 
980,it appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimes  but evidently they could not bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted mr  kurtz from his fate  we filled the steamboat with it  and had to pile a lot on the deck  thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see  because the appreciation of this favor had remained with him to the last  you should have heard him say   my ivory   oh yes  i heard him   my intended  my ivory  my station  my river  my    everything belonged to him 
981,it made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places 
982,everything belonged to him  but that was a trifle  the thing was to know what he belonged to  how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own  that was the reflection that made you creepy all over  it was impossible  it was not good for one either  trying to imagine  he had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land  i mean literally 
983,you cannot understand 
984,how could you   with solid pavement under your feet  surrounded by kind neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you  stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman  in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums  how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man own untrammeled feet may take him into by the way of solitude  utter solitude without a policeman  by the way of silence  utter silence  where no warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard whispering of public opinion 
985,these little things make all the great difference 
986,when they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength  upon your own capacity for faithfulness 
987,of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong  too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness  i take it  no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil  the fool is too much of a fool  or the devil too much of a devil  i do not know which 
988,or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds 
989,then the earth for you is only a standing place  and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain i will not pretend to say  but most of us are neither one nor the other  the earth for us is a place to live in  where we must put up with sights  with sounds  with smells too  by jove   breathe dead hippo  so to speak  and not be contaminated 
990,and there  do not you see 
991,your strength comes in  the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in  your power of devotion  not to yourself  but to an obscure  back breaking business 
992,and that is difficult enough 
993,mind  i am not trying to excuse or even explain  i am trying to account to myself for  for  mr  kurtz  for the shade of mr  kurtz 
994,this initiated wraith from the back of nowhere honored me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether 
995,this was because it could speak english to me 
996,the original kurtz had been educated partly in england  and  as he was good enough to say himself  his sympathies were in the right place 
997,his mother was half english  his father was half french 
998,all europe contributed to the making of kurtz  and by and by i learned that  most appropriately  the international society for the suppression of savage customs had intrusted him with the making of a report  for its future guidance 
999,and he had written it too 
1000,I have seen it 
1001,I have read it 
1002,it was eloquent  vibrating with eloquence  but too high strung  i think 
1003,seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for 
1004,but this must have been before his  let us say  nerves  went wrong  and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites  which  as far as i reluctantly gathered from what i heard at various times  were offered up to him  do you understand   to mr  kurtz himself 
1005,but it was a beautiful piece of writing 
1006,the opening paragraph  however  in the light of later information  strikes me now as ominous 
1007,he began with the argument that we whites  from the point of development we had arrived at   must necessarily appear to them   in the nature of supernatural beings  we approach them with the might as of a deity   and so on  and so on   by the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded    c    c  from that point he soared and took me with him  the peroration was magnificent  though difficult to remember  you know  it gave me the notion of an exotic immensity ruled by an august benevolence  it made me tingle with enthusiasm  this was the unbounded power of eloquence  of words  of burning noble words 
1008,there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases  unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page  scrawled evidently much later  in an unsteady hand  may be regarded as the exposition of a method 
1009,it was very simple  and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you  luminous and terrifying  like a flash of lightning in a serene sky   exterminate all the brutes  
1010,the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum  because  later on  when he in a sense came to himself  he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of  my pamphlet   he called it   as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career 
1011,i had full information about all these things  and  besides  as it turned out  i was to have the care of his memory 
1012,I have done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it  if i choose  for an everlasting rest in the dust bin of progress  amongst all the sweepings and  figuratively speaking  all the dead cats of civilization 
1013,but then  you see  i cannot choose 
1014,he will not be forgotten 
1015,whatever he was  he was not common 
1016,he had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch dance in his honor  he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings  he had one devoted friend at least  and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self seeking 
1017,no  i cannot forget him  though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him 
1018,i missed my late helmsman awfully   i missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot house 
1019,perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black sahara 
1020,well  do not you see  he had done something  he had steered  for months i had him at my back  a help  an instrument 
1021,it was a kind of partnership 
1022,he steered for me  i had to look after him  i worried about his deficiencies  and thus a subtle bond had been created  of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken  and the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory  like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment 
1023, poor fool 
1024,if he had only left that shutter alone 
1025,he had no restraint  no restraint  just like kurtz  a tree swayed by the wind 
1026,as soon as i had put on a dry pair of slippers  i dragged him out  after first jerking the spear out of his side  which operation i confess i performed with my eyes shut tight 
1027,his heels leaped together over the little door step  his shoulders were pressed to my breast  i hugged him from behind desperately 
1028,oh  he was heavy  heavy  heavier than any man on earth  i should imagine 
1029,then without more ado i tipped him overboard 
1030,the current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass  and i saw the body roll over twice before i lost sight of it for ever 
1031,all the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning deck about the pilot house  chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies  and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude 
1032,what they wanted to keep that body hanging about for i cannot guess 
1033,embalm it  maybe 
1034,but i had also heard another  and a very ominous  murmur on the deck below 
1035,my friends the wood cutters were likewise scandalized  and with a better show of reason  though i admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible 
1036,oh  quite 
1037,i had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten  the fishes alone should have him 
1038,he had been a very second rate helmsman while alive  but now he was dead he might have become a first class temptation  and possibly because some startling trouble 
1039,besides  i was anxious to take the wheel  the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business 
1040, this i did directly the simple funeral was over 
1041,we were going half speed  keeping right in the middle of the stream  and i listened to the talk about me 
1042,they had given up kurtz  they had given up the station  kurtz was dead  and the station had been burnt  and so on  and so on 
1043,the red haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor kurtz had been properly revenged 
1044, ownay  we must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush  eh  what do you think  say  
1045,he positively danced  the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar 
1046,and he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man 
1047,i could not help saying   you made a glorious lot of smoke  anyhow  
1048,i had seen  from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew  that almost all the shots had gone too high 
1049,you cannot hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder  but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut 
1050,the retreat  i maintained  and i was right  was caused by the screeching of the steam whistle 
1051,upon this they forgot kurtz  and began to howl at me with indignant protests 
1052, the manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events  when i saw in the distance a clearing on the river side and the outlines of some sort of building 
1053, what is this  
1054,i asked 
1055,he clapped his hands in wonder 
1056, the station   he cried 
1057,i edged in at once  still going half speed 
1058, through my glasses i saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth 
1059,a long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass  the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar  the jungle and the woods made a background 
1060,there was no inclosure or fence of any kind  but there had been one apparently  for near the house half a dozen slim posts remained in a row  roughly trimmed  and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls 
1061,the rails  or whatever there had been between  had disappeared 
1062,of course the forest surrounded all that 
1063,the river bank was clear  and on the water side i saw a white man under a hat like a cart wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm 
1064,examining the edge of the forest above and below  i was almost certain i could see movements  human forms gliding here and there  i steamed past prudently  then stopped the engines and let her drift down  the man on the shore began to shout  urging us to land   we have been attacked   screamed the manager   i know  i know  it is all right   yelled back the other  as cheerful as you please 
1065, come along  it is all right  i am glad  
1066, his aspect reminded me of something i had seen  something funny i had seen somewhere  as i maneuvered to get alongside  i was asking myself   what does this fellow look like   suddenly i got it  he looked like a harlequin  his clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably  but it was covered with patches all over  with bright patches  blue  red  and yellow   patches on the back  patches on front  patches on elbows  on knees  colored binding round his jacket  scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers  and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal  because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done 
1067,a beardless  boyish face  very fair  no features to speak of  nose peeling  little blue eyes  smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain 
1068, look out  captain   he cried   there is a snag lodged in here last night  
1069,what 
1070,another snag 
1071,i confess i swore shamefully 
1072,i had nearly holed my cripple  to finish off that charming trip 
1073,the harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me 
1074, you english   he asked  all smiles 
1075, are you  
1076,i shouted from the wheel 
1077,the smiles vanished  and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment 
1078,then he brightened up 
1079, never mind   he cried encouragingly 
1080, are we in time  
1081,i asked 
1082, he is up there   he replied  with a toss of the head up the hill  and becoming gloomy all of a sudden 
1083,his face was like the autumn sky  overcast one moment and bright the next 
1084, when the manager  escorted by the pilgrims  all of them armed to the teeth  had gone to the house  this chap came on board 
1085, i say  i do not like this  these natives are in the bush   i said 
1086,he assured me earnestly it was all right 
1087, they are simple people   he added   well  i am glad you came  it took me all my time to keep them off    but you said it was all right   i cried 
1088, oh  they meant no harm   he said  and as i stared he corrected himself   not exactly  
1089,then vivaciously   my faith  your pilot house wants a clean up  
1090,in the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble 
1091, one good screech will do more for you than all your rifles  they are simple people   he repeated 
1092,he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me 
1093,he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence  and actually hinted  laughing  that such was the case 
1094, do not you talk with mr  kurtz  
1095,i said 
1096, you do not talk with that man  you listen to him   he exclaimed with severe exaltation   but now   
1097,he waved his arm  and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency 
1098,in a moment he came up again with a jump  possessed himself of both my hands  shook them continuously  while he gabbled   brother sailor       honor       pleasure       delight       introduce myself       russian       son of an arch priest       government of tambov       what  tobacco  english tobacco  the excellent english tobacco  now  that is brotherly  smoke  where is a sailor that does not smoke  
1099, the pipe soothed him  and gradually i made out he had run away from school  had gone to sea in a russian ship  ran away again  served some time in english ships  was now reconciled with the arch priest 
1100,he made a point of that 
1101, but when one is young one must see things  gather experience  ideas  enlarge the mind    here  
1102,i interrupted 
1103, you can never tell  here i have met mr  kurtz   he said  youthfully solemn and reproachful 
1104,i held my tongue after that 
1105,it appears he had persuaded a dutch trading house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods  and had started for the interior with a light heart  and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby 
1106,he had been wandering about that river for nearly two years alone  cut off from everybody and everything 
1107, i am not so young as i look  i am twenty five   he said 
1108, at first old van shuyten would tell me to go to the devil   he narrated with keen enjoyment   but i stuck to him  and talked and talked  till at last he got afraid i would talk the hind leg off his favorite dog  so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns  and told me he hoped he would never see my face again  good old dutchman  van shuyten  I have sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago  so that he cannot call me a little thief when i get back  i hope he got it  and for the rest i do not care  i had some wood stacked for you  that was my old house  did you see  
1109, i gave him towson own book  he made as though he would kiss me  but restrained himself   the only book i had left  and i thought i had lost it   he said  looking at it ecstatically   owno many accidents happen to a man going about alone  you know  canoes get upset sometimes  and sometimes you have got to clear out so quick when the people get angry   he thumbed the pages   you made notes in russian   i asked  he nodded   i thought they were written in cipher   i said  he laughed  then became serious   i had lots of trouble to keep these people off   he said   did they want to kill you   i asked   oh no   he cried  and checked himself   why did they attack us   i pursued  he hesitated  then said shamefacedly   they do not want him to go    do not they   i said  curiously  he nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom   i tell you   he cried   this man has enlarged my mind   he opened his arms wide  staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round  
1110, i looked at him  lost in astonishment 
1111,there he was before me  in motley  as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes  enthusiastic  fabulous 
1112,his very existence was improbable  inexplicable  and altogether bewildering 
1113,he was an insoluble problem 
1114,it was inconceivable how he had existed  how he had succeeded in getting so far  how he had managed to remain  why he did not instantly disappear   i went a little farther   he said   then still a little farther  till i had gone so far that i do not know how I will ever get back  never mind  plenty time  i can manage  you take kurtz away quick  quick  i tell you  
1115,the glamour of youth enveloped his particolored rags  his destitution  his loneliness  the essential desolation of his futile wanderings 
1116,for months  for years  his life had not been worth a day own purchase  and there he was gallantly  thoughtlessly alive  to all appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting audacity 
1117,i was seduced into something like admiration  like envy 
1118,glamour urged him on  glamour kept him unscathed 
1119,he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through 
1120,his need was to exist  and to move onwards at the greatest possible risk  and with a maximum of privation 
1121,if the absolutely pure  uncalculating  unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being  it ruled this be patched youth 
1122,i almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame 
1123,it seemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely  that  even while he was talking to you  you forgot that it was he  the man before your eyes  who had gone through these things 
1124,i did not envy him his devotion to kurtz  though 
1125,he had not meditated over it 
1126,it came to him  and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism 
1127,i must say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far 
1128, they had come together unavoidably  like two ships becalmed near each other  and lay rubbing sides at last 
1129,i suppose kurtz wanted an audience  because on a certain occasion  when encamped in the forest  they had talked all night  or more probably kurtz had talked 
1130, we talked of everything   he said  quite transported at the recollection 
1131, i forgot there was such a thing as sleep  the night did not seem to last an hour  everything  everything        of love too    ah  he talked to you of love  
1132,i said  much amused 
1133, it is not what you think   he cried  almost passionately 
1134, it was in general  he made me see things  things  
1135, he threw his arms up 
1136,we were on deck at the time  and the headman of my wood cutters  lounging near by  turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes 
1137,i looked around  and i do not know why  but i assure you that never  never before  did this land  this river  this jungle  the very arch of this blazing sky  appear to me so hopeless and so dark  so impenetrable to human thought  so pitiless to human weakness 
1138, and  ever since  you have been with him  of course  
1139,i said 
1140, on the contrary 
1141,it appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes 
1142,he had  as he informed me proudly  managed to nurse kurtz through two illnesses  he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat   but as a rule kurtz wandered alone  far in the depths of the forest 
1143, very often coming to this station  i had to wait days and days before he would turn up   he said 
1144, ah  it was worth waiting for   sometimes    what was he doing  exploring or what   i asked   oh yes  of course   he had discovered lots of villages  a lake too  he did not know exactly in what direction  it was dangerous to inquire too much  but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory   but he had no goods to trade with by that time   i objected   there is a good lot of cartridges left even yet   he answered  looking away   to speak plainly  he raided the country   i said  he nodded   not alone  surely   he muttered something about the villages round that lake   kurtz got the tribe to follow him  did he   i suggested  he fidgeted a little   they adored him   he said  the tone of these words was so extraordinary that i looked at him searchingly  it was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of kurtz  the man filled his life  occupied his thoughts  swayed his emotions   what can you expect   he burst out   he came to them with thunder and lightning  you know  and they had never seen anything like it  and very terrible  he could be very terrible  you cannot judge mr  kurtz as you would an ordinary man  no  no  no  now  just to give you an idea  i do not mind telling you  he wanted to shoot me too one day  but i do not judge him    ownhoot you  
1145,i cried 
1146, what for    well  i had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me  you see i used to shoot game for them  well  he wanted it  and would not hear reason  he declared he would shoot me unless i gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country  because he could do so  and had a fancy for it  and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased  and it was true too  i gave him the ivory  what did i care  but i did not clear out  no  no  i could not leave him  i had to be careful  of course  till we got friendly again for a time  he had his second illness then  afterwards i had to keep out of the way  but i did not mind  he was living for the most part in those villages on the lake  when he came down to the river  sometimes he would take to me  and sometimes it was better for me to be careful  this man suffered too much  he hated all this  and somehow he could not get away  when i had a chance i begged him to try and leave while there was time  i offered to go back with him  and he would say yes  and then he would remain  go off on another ivory hunt  disappear for weeks  forget himself amongst these people  forget himself  you know    why  he is mad   i said 
1147,he protested indignantly 
1148,mr  kurtz could not be mad 
1149,if i had heard him talk  only two days ago  i would not dare hint at such a thing 
1150,      i had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was looking at the shore  sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house 
1151,the consciousness of there being people in that bush  so silent  so quiet  as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hill  made me uneasy 
1152,there was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations  completed by shrugs  in interrupted phrases  in hints ending in deep sighs 
1153,the woods were unmoved  like a mask  heavy  like the closed door of a prison  they looked with their air of hidden knowledge  of patient expectation  of unapproachable silence 
1154,the russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that mr  kurtz had come down to the river  bringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe 
1155,he had been absent for several months  getting himself adored  i suppose  and had come down unexpectedly  with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream 
1156,evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the  what shall i say   less material aspirations 
1157,however he had got much worse suddenly 
1158, i heard he was lying helpless  and so i came up  took my chance   said the russian 
1159, oh  he is bad  very bad  
1160,i directed my glass to the house 
1161,there were no signs of life  but there was the ruined roof  the long mud wall peeping above the grass  with three little square window holes  no two of the same size  all this brought within reach of my hand  as it were 
1162,and then i made a brusque movement  and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass 
1163,you remember i told you i had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation  rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place 
1164,now i had suddenly a nearer view  and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow 
1165,then i went carefully from post to post with my glass  and i saw my mistake 
1166,these round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic  they were expressive and puzzling  striking and disturbing  food for thought and also for the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky  but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole  they would have been even more impressive  those heads on the stakes  if their faces had not been turned to the house  only one  the first i had made out  was facing my way  i was not so shocked as you may think  the start back i had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise  i had expected to see a knob of wood there  you know  i returned deliberately to the first i had seen  and there it was  black  dried  sunken  with closed eyelids   a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole  and  with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth  was smiling too  smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber 
1167, i am not disclosing any trade secrets 
1168,in fact the manager said afterwards that mr  kurtz own methods had ruined the district 
1169,i have no opinion on that point  but i want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there 
1170,they only showed that mr  kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts  that there was something wanting in him  some small matter which  when the pressing need arose  could not be found under his magnificent eloquence  whether he knew of this deficiency himself i cannot say  i think the knowledge came to him at last  only at the very last 
1171,but the wilderness had found him out early  and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion 
1172,i think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know  things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude  and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating 
1173,it echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core 
1174,      i put down the glass  and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance 
1175, the admirer of mr  kurtz was a bit crestfallen 
1176,in a hurried  indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take these  say  symbols  down 
1177,he was not afraid of the natives  they would not stir till mr  kurtz gave the word 
1178,his ascendency was extraordinary 
1179,the camps of these people surrounded the place  and the chiefs came every day to see him 
1180,they would crawl 
1181,       i do not want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching mr  kurtz   i shouted 
1182,curious  this feeling that came over me that such details would be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under mr  kurtz own windows 
1183,after all  that was only a savage sight  while i seemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors  where pure  uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief  being something that had a right to exist  obviously  in the sunshine 
1184,the young man looked at me with surprise 
1185,i suppose it did not occur to him mr  kurtz was no idol of mine 
1186,he forgot i had not heard any of these splendid monologues on  what was it 
1187,on love  justice  conduct of life  or what not  if it had come to crawling before mr  kurtz  he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all  i had no idea of the conditions  he said  these heads were the heads of rebels  i shocked him excessively by laughing  rebels  what would be the next definition i was to hear  there had been enemies  criminals  workers  and these were rebels 
1188,those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks 
1189, you do not know how such a life tries a man like kurtz   cried kurtz own last disciple 
1190, well  and you  
1191,i said 
1192, i  i  i am a simple man  i have no great thoughts  i want nothing from anybody  how can you compare me to        
1193,his feelings were too much for speech  and suddenly he broke down 
1194, i do not understand   he groaned 
1195, I have been doing my best to keep him alive  and that is enough  i had no hand in all this  i have no abilities  there has not been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here  he was shamefully abandoned  a man like this  with such ideas  shamefully  shamefully  i  i  have not slept for the last ten nights        
1196, his voice lost itself in the calm of the evening 
1197,the long shadows of the forest had slipped down hill while we talked  had gone far beyond the ruined hovel  beyond the symbolic row of stakes 
1198,all this was in the gloom  while we down there were yet in the sunshine  and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendor  with a murky and over shadowed bend above and below 
1199,not a living soul was seen on the shore 
1200,the bushes did not rustle 
1201, suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared  as though they had come up from the ground 
1202,they waded waist deep in the grass  in a compact body  bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst 
1203,instantly  in the emptiness of the landscape  a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land  and  as if by enchantment  streams of human beings  of naked human beings  with spears in their hands  with bows  with shields  with wild glances and savage movements  were poured into the clearing by the dark faced and pensive forest 
1204,the bushes shook  the grass swayed for a time  and then everything stood still in attentive immobility 
1205,  now  if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for   said the russian at my elbow 
1206,the knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too  half way to the steamer  as if petrified 
1207,i saw the man on the stretcher sit up  lank and with an uplifted arm  above the shoulders of the bearers 
1208, let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time   i said 
1209,i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation  as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring necessity 
1210,i could not hear a sound  but through my glasses i saw the thin arm extended commandingly  the lower jaw moving  the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks 
1211,kurtz  kurtz  that means short in german  do not it  well  the name was as true as everything else in his life  and death 
1212,he looked at least seven feet long 
1213,his covering had fallen off  and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding sheet 
1214,i could see the cage of his ribs all astir  the bones of his arm waving 
1215,it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze 
1216,i saw him open his mouth wide  it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect  as though he had wanted to swallow all the air  all the earth  all the men before him 
1217,a deep voice reached me faintly 
1218,he must have been shouting 
1219,he fell back suddenly 
1220,the stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again  and almost at the same time i noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat  as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration 
1221, some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms  two shot guns  a heavy rifle  and a light revolver carbine  the thunderbolts of that pitiful jupiter  the manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head  they laid him down in one of the little cabins  just a room for a bed place and a camp stool or two  you know 
1222,we had brought his belated correspondence  and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed 
1223,his hand roamed feebly amongst these papers 
1224,i was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of his expression 
1225,it was not so much the exhaustion of disease 
1226,he did not seem in pain 
1227,this shadow looked satiated and calm  as though for the moment it had had its fill of all the emotions 
1228, he rustled one of the letters  and looking straight in my face said   i am glad  
1229,somebody had been writing to him about me 
1230,these special recommendations were turning up again 
1231,the volume of tone he emitted without effort  almost without the trouble of moving his lips  amazed me 
1232,a voice  a voice 
1233,it was grave  profound  vibrating  while the man did not seem capable of a whisper 
1234,however  he had enough strength in him  factitious no doubt  to very nearly make an end of us  as you shall hear directly 
1235, the manager appeared silently in the doorway  i stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me 
1236,the russian  eyed curiously by the pilgrims  was staring at the shore 
1237,i followed the direction of his glance 
1238, dark human shapes could be made out in the distance  flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest  and near the river two bronze figures  leaning on tall spears  stood in the sunlight under fantastic headdresses of spotted skins  warlike and still in statuesque repose 
1239,and from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman 
1240, she walked with measured steps  draped in striped and fringed cloths  treading the earth proudly  with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments 
1241,she carried her head high  her hair was done in the shape of a helmet  she had brass leggings to the knee  brass wire gauntlets to the elbow  a crimson spot on her tawny cheek  innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck  bizarre things  charms  gifts of witch men  that hung about her  glittered and trembled at every step 
1242,she must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her 
1243,she was savage and superb  wild eyed and magnificent  there was something ominous and stately in her deliberate progress 
1244,and in the hush that had fallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land  the immense wilderness  the colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her  pensive  as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul 
1245, she came abreast of the steamer  stood still  and faced us 
1246,her long shadow fell to the water own edge 
1247,her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling  half shaped resolve 
1248,she stood looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself  with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose 
1249,a whole minute passed  and then she made a step forward 
1250,there was a low jingle  a glint of yellow metal  a sway of fringed draperies  and she stopped as if her heart had failed her 
1251,the young fellow by my side growled 
1252,the pilgrims murmured at my back 
1253,she looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her glance 
1254,suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head  as though in an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky  and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the earth  swept around on the river  gathering the steamer into a shadowy embrace 
1255,a formidable silence hung over the scene 
1256, she turned away slowly  walked on  following the bank  and passed into the bushes to the left 
1257,once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared 
1258,  if she had offered to come aboard i really think i would have tried to shoot her   said the man of patches  nervously 
1259, i had been risking my life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house  she got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags i picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with  i was not decent  at least it must have been that  for she talked like a fury to kurtz for an hour  pointing at me now and then  i do not understand the dialect of this tribe  luckily for me  i fancy kurtz felt too ill that day to care  or there would have been mischief  i do not understand        no  it is too much for me  ah  well  it is all over now  
1260, at this moment i heard kurtz own deep voice behind the curtain   ownave me   save the ivory  you mean  do not tell me  save  me   why  I have had to save you  you are interrupting my plans now  sick  sick  not so sick as you would like to believe  never mind  I will carry my ideas out yet  i will return 
1261,I will show you what can be done 
1262,you with your little peddling notions  you are interfering with me  i will return 
1263, the manager came out  he did me the honor to take me under the arm and lead me aside   he is very low  very low   he said  he considered it necessary to sigh  but neglected to be consistently sorrowful   we have done all we could for him  have not we  but there is no disguising the fact  mr  kurtz has done more harm than good to the company  he did not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action  cautiously  cautiously  that is my principle  we must be cautious yet  the district is closed to us for a time  deplorable  upon the whole  the trade will suffer  i do not deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory  mostly fossil  we must save it  at all events  but look how precarious the position is  and why  because the method is unsound    do you   said i  looking at the shore   call it  unsound method     without doubt   he exclaimed  hotly   do not you          no method at all   i murmured after a while   exactly   he exulted   i anticipated this  shows a complete want of judgment  it is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter    oh   said i   that fellow  what is his name   the brickmaker  will make a readable report for you   he appeared confounded for a moment  it seemed to me i had never breathed an atmosphere so vile  and i turned mentally to kurtz for relief  positively for relief 
1264, nevertheless i think mr  kurtz is a remarkable man   i said with emphasis 
1265,he started  dropped on me a cold heavy glance  said very quietly   he  was    and turned his back on me 
1266,my hour of favor was over  i found myself lumped along with kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe  i was unsound 
1267,ah  but it was something to have at least a choice of nightmares 
1268, i had turned to the wilderness really  not to mr  kurtz  who  i was ready to admit  was as good as buried 
1269,and for a moment it seemed to me as if i also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets 
1270,i felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast  the smell of the damp earth  the unseen presence of victorious corruption  the darkness of an impenetrable night 
1271,      the russian tapped me on the shoulder 
1272,i heard him mumbling and stammering something about  brother seaman  could not conceal  knowledge of matters that would affect mr  kurtz own reputation  
1273,i waited 
1274,for him evidently mr  kurtz was not in his grave  i suspect that for him mr  kurtz was one of the immortals 
1275, well   said i at last   ownpeak out  as it happens  i am mr  kurtz own friend  in a way  
1276, he stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been  of the same profession   he would have kept the matter to himself without regard to consequences 
1277, he suspected there was an active ill will towards him on the part of these white men that     you are right   i said  remembering a certain conversation i had overheard   the manager thinks you ought to be hanged   he showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at first   i had better get out of the way quietly   he said  earnestly   i can do no more for kurtz now  and they would soon find some excuse  what is to stop them  there is a military post three hundred miles from here    well  upon my word   said i   perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by    plenty   he said   they are simple people  and i want nothing  you know  
1278,he stood biting his lips  then   i do not want any harm to happen to these whites here  but of course i was thinking of mr  kurtz own reputation  but you are a brother seaman and     right   said i  after a time 
1279, mr  kurtz own reputation is safe with me  
1280,i did not know how truly i spoke 
1281, he informed me  lowering his voice  that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer 
1282, he hated sometimes the idea of being taken away  and then again        but i do not understand these matters  i am a simple man  he thought it would scare you away  that you would give it up  thinking him dead  i could not stop him  oh  i had an awful time of it this last month    very well   i said 
1283, he is all right now    ye e es   he muttered  not very convinced apparently 
1284, thanks   said i   i shall keep my eyes open    but quiet  eh   he urged  anxiously   it would be awful for his reputation if anybody here   
1285,i promised a complete discretion with great gravity 
1286, i have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far  i am off  could you give me a few martini henry cartridges  
1287,i could  and did  with proper secrecy 
1288,he helped himself  with a wink at me  to a handful of my tobacco 
1289, between sailors  you know  good english tobacco  
1290,at the door of the pilot house he turned round   
1291,i say  have not you a pair of shoes you could spare  
1292,he raised one leg 
1293, look  
1294,the soles were tied with knotted strings sandal wise under his bare feet 
1295,i rooted out an old pair  at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm 
1296,one of his pockets  bright red  was bulging with cartridges  from the other  dark blue  peeped  towson own inquiry    c 
1297,he seemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness 
1298, ah  I will never  never meet such a man again  you ought to have heard him recite poetry  his own too it was  he told me  poetry   he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights   oh  he enlarged my mind    goodby   said i  he shook hands and vanished in the night  sometimes i ask myself whether i had ever really seen him  whether it was possible to meet such a phenomenon 
1299, when i woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed  in the starred darkness  real enough to make me get up for the purpose of having a look round 
1300,on the hill a big fire burned  illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the station house 
1301,one of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks  armed for the purpose  was keeping guard over the ivory  but deep within the forest  red gleams that wavered  that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness  showed the exact position of the camp where mr  kurtz own adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil 
1302,the monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration 
1303,a steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black  flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive  and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half awake senses 
1304,i believe i dozed off leaning over the rail  till an abrupt burst of yells  an overwhelming outbreak of a pent up and mysterious frenzy  woke me up in a bewildered wonder 
1305,it was cut short all at once  and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence 
1306,i glanced casually into the little cabin 
1307,a light was burning within  but mr  kurtz was not there 
1308, i think i would have raised an outcry if i had believed my eyes 
1309,but i did not believe them at first  the thing seemed so impossible  the fact is i was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright  pure abstract terror  unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger  what made this emotion so overpowering was  how shall i define it   the moral shock i received  as if something altogether monstrous  intolerable to thought and odious to the soul  had been thrust upon me unexpectedly 
1310,this lasted of course the merest fraction of a second  and then the usual sense of commonplace  deadly danger  the possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre  or something of the kind  which i saw impending  was positively welcome and composing 
1311,it pacified me  in fact  so much  that i did not raise an alarm 
1312, there was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of me 
1313,the yells had not awakened him  he snored very slightly  i left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore 
1314,i did not betray mr  kurtz  it was ordered i should never betray him  it was written i should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice 
1315,i was anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone   and to this day i do not know why i was so jealous of sharing with anyone the peculiar blackness of that experience 
1316, as soon as i got on the bank i saw a trail  a broad trail through the grass  i remember the exultation with which i said to myself   he cannot walk  he is crawling on all fours  I have got him   the grass was wet with dew  i strode rapidly with clenched fists  i fancy i had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing  i do not know  i had some imbecile thoughts  the knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair  i saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of winchesters held to the hip  i thought i would never get back to the steamer  and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age  such silly things  you know 
1317,and i remember i confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart  and was pleased at its calm regularity 
1318, i kept to the track though  then stopped to listen  the night was very clear  a dark blue space  sparkling with dew and starlight  in which black things stood very still  i thought i could see a kind of motion ahead of me  i was strangely cocksure of everything that night  i actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle  i verily believe chuckling to myself  so as to get in front of that stir  of that motion i had seen  if indeed i had seen anything 
1319,i was circumventing kurtz as though it had been a boyish game 
1320, i came upon him  and  if he had not heard me coming  i would have fallen over him too  but he got up in time 
1321,he rose  unsteady  long  pale  indistinct  like a vapor exhaled by the earth  and swayed slightly  misty and silent before me  while at my back the fires loomed between the trees  and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest 
1322,i had cut him off cleverly  but when actually confronting him i seemed to come to my senses  i saw the danger in its right proportion 
1323,it was by no means over yet 
1324,suppose he began to shout 
1325,though he could hardly stand  there was still plenty of vigor in his voice 
1326, go away  hide yourself   he said  in that profound tone  it was very awful  i glanced back  we were within thirty yards from the nearest fire  a black figure stood up  strode on long black legs  waving long black arms  across the glow  it had horns  antelope horns  i think  on its head 
1327,some sorcerer  some witch man  no doubt  it looked fiend like enough 
1328, do you know what you are doing  
1329,i whispered 
1330, perfectly   he answered  raising his voice for that single word  it sounded to me far off and yet loud  like a hail through a speaking trumpet 
1331, if he makes a row we are lost   i thought to myself 
1332,this clearly was not a case for fisticuffs  even apart from the very natural aversion i had to beat that shadow  this wandering and tormented thing   you will be lost   i said   utterly lost 
1333,  one gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration  you know 
1334,i did say the right thing  though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment  when the foundations of our intimacy were being laid  to endure  to endure  even to the end  even beyond 
1335,  i had immense plans   he muttered irresolutely 
1336, yes   said i   but if you try to shout I will smash your head with    there was not a stick or a stone near   i will throttle you for good   i corrected myself   i was on the threshold of great things   he pleaded  in a voice of longing  with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold   and now for this stupid scoundrel     your success in europe is assured in any case   i affirmed  steadily 
1337,i did not want to have the throttling of him  you understand  and indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose  i tried to break the spell  the heavy  mute spell of the wilderness  that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts  by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions  this alone  i was convinced  had driven him out to the edge of the forest  to the bush  towards the gleam of fires  the throb of drums  the drone of weird incantations  this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations  and  do not you see  the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the head  though i had a very lively sense of that danger too  but in this  that i had to deal with a being to whom i could not appeal in the name of anything high or low  i had  even like the niggers  to invoke him  himself his own exalted and incredible degradation 
1338,there was nothing either above or below him  and i knew it 
1339,he had kicked himself loose of the earth 
1340,confound the man  he had kicked the very earth to pieces 
1341,he was alone  and i before him did not know whether i stood on the ground or floated in the air 
1342,I have been telling you what we said  repeating the phrases we pronounced   but what is the good 
1343,they were common everyday words   the familiar  vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life  but what of that  they had behind them  to my mind  the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams  of phrases spoken in nightmares  soul  if anybody had ever struggled with a soul  i am the man  and i was not arguing with a lunatic either  believe me or not  his intelligence was perfectly clear  concentrated  it is true  upon himself with horrible intensity  yet clear  and therein was my only chance  barring  of course  the killing him there and then  which was not so good  on account of unavoidable noise  but his soul was mad  being alone in the wilderness  it had looked within itself  and  by heavens  i tell you  it had gone mad  i had  for my sins  i suppose  to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself  no eloquence could have been so withering to one own belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity  he struggled with himself  too  i saw it   i heard it 
1344,i saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint  no faith  and no fear  yet struggling blindly with itself 
1345,i kept my head pretty well  but when i had him at last stretched on the couch  i wiped my forehead  while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my back down that hill 
1346,and yet i had only supported him  his bony arm clasped round my neck  and he was not much heavier than a child 
1347, when next day we left at noon  the crowd  of whose presence behind the curtain of trees i had been acutely conscious all the time  flowed out of the woods again  filled the clearing  covered the slope with a mass of naked  breathing  quivering  bronze bodies 
1348,i steamed up a bit  then swung down stream  and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing  thumping  fierce river demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air 
1349,in front of the first rank  along the river  three men  plastered with bright red earth from head to foot  strutted to and fro restlessly 
1350,when we came abreast again  they faced the river  stamped their feet  nodded their horned heads  swayed their scarlet bodies  they shook towards the fierce river demon a bunch of black feathers  a mangy skin with a pendent tail  something that looked like a dried gourd  they shouted periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language  and the deep murmurs of the crowd  interrupted suddenly  were like the response of some satanic litany 
1351, we had carried kurtz into the pilot house  there was more air there 
1352,lying on the couch  he stared through the open shutter 
1353,there was an eddy in the mass of human bodies  and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream 
1354,she put out her hands  shouted something  and all that wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of articulated  rapid  breathless utterance 
1355,  do you understand this  
1356,i asked 
1357, he kept on looking out past me with fiery  longing eyes  with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate 
1358,he made no answer  but i saw a smile  a smile of indefinable meaning  appear on his colorless lips that a moment after twitched convulsively 
1359, do i not   he said slowly  gasping  as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural power 
1360, i pulled the string of the whistle  and i did this because i saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark 
1361,at the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged mass of bodies 
1362, do not  do not you frighten them away   cried someone on deck disconsolately 
1363,i pulled the string time after time 
1364,they broke and ran  they leaped  they crouched  they swerved  they dodged the flying terror of the sound 
1365,the three red chaps had fallen flat  face down on the shore  as though they had been shot dead 
1366,only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch  and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the somber and glittering river 
1367, and then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun  and i could see nothing more for smoke 
1368, the brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness  bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress  and kurtz own life was running swiftly too  ebbing  ebbing out of his heart into the sea of inexorable time 
1369,the manager was very placid  he had no vital anxieties now  he took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance  the  affair  had come off as well as could be wished 
1370,i saw the time approaching when i would be left alone of the party of  unsound method  
1371,the pilgrims looked upon me with disfavor 
1372,i was  so to speak  numbered with the dead 
1373,it is strange how i accepted this unforeseen partnership  this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms 
1374, kurtz discoursed 
1375,a voice  a voice 
1376,it rang deep to the very last 
1377,it survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness of his heart 
1378,oh  he struggled  he struggled 
1379,the wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now  images of wealth and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression  my intended  my station  my career  my ideas  these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments 
1380,the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow sham  whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mold of primeval earth 
1381,but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions  avid of lying fame  of sham distinction  of all the appearances of success and power 
1382, sometimes he was contemptibly childish 
1383,he desired to have kings meet him at railway stations on his return from some ghastly nowhere  where he intended to accomplish great things 
1384, you show them you have in you something that is really profitable  and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your ability   he would say 
1385, of course you must take care of the motives  right motives  always  
1386,the long reaches that were like one and the same reach  monotonous bends that were exactly alike  slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world  the forerunner of change  of conquest  of trade  of massacres  of blessings 
1387,i looked ahead  piloting 
1388, close the shutter   said kurtz suddenly one day   i cannot bear to look at this  
1389,i did so 
1390,there was a silence 
1391, oh  but i will wring your heart yet   he cried at the invisible wilderness 
1392, we broke down  as i had expected  and had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island 
1393,this delay was the first thing that shook kurtz own confidence 
1394,one morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photograph   the lot tied together with a shoe string 
1395, keep this for me   he said 
1396, this noxious fool   meaning the manager   is capable of prying into my boxes when i am not looking  
1397,in the afternoon i saw him 
1398,he was lying on his back with closed eyes  and i withdrew quietly  but i heard him mutter   live rightly  die  die       
1399,i listened 
1400,there was nothing more 
1401,was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep  or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article 
1402,he had been writing for the papers and meant to do so again   for the furthering of my ideas  it is a duty  
1403, his was an impenetrable darkness 
1404,i looked at him as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines 
1405,but i had not much time to give him  because i was helping the engine driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders  to straighten a bent connecting rod  and in other such matters 
1406,i lived in an infernal mess of rust  filings  nuts  bolts  spanners  hammers  ratchet drills  things i abominate  because i do not get on with them 
1407,i tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard  i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap  unless i had the shakes too bad to stand 
1408, one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously   i am lying here in the dark waiting for death  
1409,the light was within a foot of his eyes 
1410,i forced myself to murmur   oh  nonsense   and stood over him as if transfixed 
1411, anything approaching the change that came over his features i have never seen before  and hope never to see again 
1412,oh  i was not touched 
1413,i was fascinated 
1414,it was as though a veil had been rent 
1415,i saw on that ivory face the expression of somber pride  of ruthless power  of craven terror  of an intense and hopeless despair  did he live his life again in every detail of desire  temptation  and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge  he cried in a whisper at some image  at some vision   he cried out twice  a cry that was no more than a breath  
1416,  the horror 
1417,the horror  
1418, i blew the candle out and left the cabin 
1419,the pilgrims were dining in the mess room  and i took my place opposite the manager  who lifted his eyes to give me a questioning glance  which i successfully ignored 
1420,he leaned back  serene  with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness 
1421,a continuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp  upon the cloth  upon our hands and faces 
1422,suddenly the manager own boy put his insolent black head in the doorway  and said in a tone of scathing contempt  
1423,  mistah kurtz  he dead 
1424, all the pilgrims rushed out to see 
1425,i remained  and went on with my dinner 
1426,i believe i was considered brutally callous 
1427,however  i did not eat much 
1428,there was a lamp in there  light  do not you know  and outside it was so beastly  beastly dark 
1429,i went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth 
1430,the voice was gone 
1431,what else had been there 
1432,but i am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole 
1433, and then they very nearly buried me 
1434, however  as you see  i did not go to join kurtz there and then 
1435,i did not 
1436,i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end  and to show my loyalty to kurtz once more 
1437,destiny 
1438,my destiny 
1439,droll thing life is  that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose  the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself  that comes too late  a crop of unextinguishable regrets 
1440,i have wrestled with death 
1441,it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine 
1442,it takes place in an impalpable grayness  with nothing underfoot  with nothing around  without spectators  without clamor  without glory  without the great desire of victory  without the great fear of defeat  in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism  without much belief in your own right  and still less in that of your adversary 
1443,if such is the form of ultimate wisdom  then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be 
1444,i was within a hair own breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement  and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say 
1445,this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man 
1446,he had something to say 
1447,he said it 
1448,since i had peeped over the edge myself  i understand better the meaning of his stare  that could not see the flame of the candle  but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe  piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness 
1449,he had summed up  he had judged   the horror   he was a remarkable man  after all  this was the expression of some sort of belief  it had candor  it had conviction  it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper  it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth  the strange commingling of desire and hate 
1450,and it is not my own extremity i remember best  a vision of grayness without form filled with physical pain  and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things  even of this pain itself 
1451,it is his extremity that i seem to have lived through 
1452,true  he had made that last stride  he had stepped over the edge  while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot 
1453,and perhaps in this is the whole difference  perhaps all the wisdom  and all truth  and all sincerity  are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible 
1454,perhaps 
1455,i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt 
1456,better his cry  much better 
1457,it was an affirmation  a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats  by abominable terrors  by abominable satisfactions 
1458,but it was a victory 
1459,that is why i have remained loyal to kurtz to the last  and even beyond  when a long time after i heard once more  not his own voice  but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal 
1460, no  they did not bury me  though there is a period of time which i remember mistily  with a shuddering wonder  like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire 
1461,i found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other  to devour their infamous cookery  to gulp their unwholesome beer  to dream their insignificant and silly dreams 
1462,they trespassed upon my thoughts 
1463,they were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense  because i felt so sure they could not possibly know the things i knew 
1464,their bearing  which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety  was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend 
1465,i had no particular desire to enlighten them  but i had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces  so full of stupid importance 
1466,i dare say i was not very well at that time 
1467,i tottered about the streets  there were various affairs to settle  grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons 
1468,i admit my behavior was inexcusable  but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days 
1469,my dear aunt own endeavors to  nurse up my strength  seemed altogether beside the mark 
1470,it was not my strength that wanted nursing  it was my imagination that wanted soothing 
1471,i kept the bundle of papers given me by kurtz  not knowing exactly what to do with it 
1472,his mother had died lately  watched over  as i was told  by his intended 
1473,a clean shaved man  with an official manner and wearing gold rimmed spectacles  called on me one day and made inquiries  at first circuitous  afterwards suavely pressing  about what he was pleased to denominate certain  documents  
1474,i was not surprised  because i had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there 
1475,i had refused to give up the smallest scrap out of that package  and i took the same attitude with the spectacled man 
1476,he became darkly menacing at last  and with much heat argued that the company had the right to every bit of information about its  territories  
1477,and  said he   mr  kurtz own knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiar  owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed  therefore   i assured him mr  kurtz own knowledge  however extensive  did not bear upon the problems of commerce or administration 
1478,he invoked then the name of science 
1479, it would be an incalculable loss if    c 
1480,i offered him the report on the  ownuppression of savage customs   with the postscriptum torn off 
1481,he took it up eagerly  but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt 
1482, this is not what we had a right to expect   he remarked 
1483, expect nothing else   i said 
1484, there are only private letters  
1485,he withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings  and i saw him no more  but another fellow  calling himself kurtz own cousin  appeared two days later  and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative own last moments 
1486,incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been essentially a great musician 
1487, there was the making of an immense success   said the man  who was an organist  i believe  with lank gray hair flowing over a greasy coat collar 
1488,i had no reason to doubt his statement  and to this day i am unable to say what was kurtz own profession  whether he ever had any  which was the greatest of his talents  i had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers  or else for a journalist who could paint  but even the cousin  who took snuff during the interview  could not tell me what he had been  exactly  he was a universal genius  on that point i agreed with the old chap  who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agitation  bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance 
1489,ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his  dear colleague  turned up 
1490,this visitor informed me kurtz own proper sphere ought to have been politics  on the popular side  
1491,he had furry straight eyebrows  bristly hair cropped short  an eye glass on a broad ribbon  and  becoming expansive  confessed his opinion that kurtz really could not write a bit   but heavens  how that man could talk  he electrified large meetings  he had faith  do not you see   he had the faith  he could get himself to believe anything  anything 
1492,he would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party 
1493,   what party  
1494,i asked 
1495, any party   answered the other 
1496, he was an  an  extremist  
1497,did i not think so 
1498,i assented 
1499,did i know  he asked  with a sudden flash of curiosity   what it was that had induced him to go out there    yes   said i  and forthwith handed him the famous report for publication  if he thought fit 
1500,he glanced through it hurriedly  mumbling all the time  judged  it would do   and took himself off with this plunder 
1501, thus i was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl own portrait 
1502,she struck me as beautiful  i mean she had a beautiful expression  i know that the sunlight can be made to lie too  yet one felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features  she seemed ready to listen without mental reservation  without suspicion  without a thought for herself  i concluded i would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself  curiosity  yes  and also some other feeling perhaps  all that had been kurtz own had passed out of my hands  his soul  his body  his station  his plans  his ivory  his career  there remained only his memory and his intended  and i wanted to give that up too to the past  in a way   to surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate 
1503,i do not defend myself 
1504,i had no clear perception of what it was i really wanted 
1505,perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty  or the fulfillment of one of these ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence 
1506,i do not know 
1507,i cannot tell 
1508,but i went 
1509, i thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every man own life   a vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage  but before the high and ponderous door  between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well kept alley in a cemetery  i had a vision of him on the stretcher  opening his mouth voraciously  as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind 
1510,he lived then before me  he lived as much as he had ever lived  a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances  of frightful realities  a shadow darker than the shadow of the night  and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence  the vision seemed to enter the house with me  the stretcher  the phantom bearers  the wild crowd of obedient worshipers  the gloom of the forests  the glitter of the reach between the murky bends  the beat of the drum  regular and muffled like the beating of a heart  the heart of a conquering darkness  it was a moment of triumph for the wilderness  an invading and vengeful rush which  it seemed to me  i would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul  and the memory of what i had heard him say afar there  with the horned shapes stirring at my back  in the glow of fires  within the patient woods  those broken phrases came back to me  were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity  i remembered his abject pleading  his abject threats  the colossal scale of his vile desires  the meanness  the torment  the tempestuous anguish of his soul  and later on i seemed to see his collected languid manner  when he said one day   this lot of ivory now is really mine  the company did not pay for it  i collected it myself at a very great personal risk  i am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though  h m  it is a difficult case  what do you think i ought to do  resist 
1511,i want no more than justice 
1512,        he wanted no more than justice  no more than justice  i rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor  and while i waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel  stare with that wide and immense stare embracing  condemning  loathing all the universe 
1513,i seemed to hear the whispered cry   the horror 
1514,the horror  
1515, the dusk was falling 
1516,i had to wait in a lofty drawing room with three long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped columns 
1517,the bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct curves 
1518,the tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness 
1519,a grand piano stood massively in a corner  with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a somber and polished sarcophagus 
1520,a high door opened  closed 
1521,i rose 
1522, she came forward  all in black  with a pale head  floating towards me in the dusk 
1523,she was in mourning 
1524,it was more than a year since his death  more than a year since the news came  she seemed as though she would remember and mourn for ever 
1525,she took both my hands in hers and murmured   i had heard you were coming  
1526,i noticed she was not very young  i mean not girlish  she had a mature capacity for fidelity  for belief  for suffering  the room seemed to have grown darker  as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead  this fair hair  this pale visage  this pure brow  seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me  their glance was guileless  profound  confident  and trustful  she carried her sorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow  as though she would say   i  i alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves  
1527,but while we were still shaking hands  such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that i perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of time 
1528,for her he had died only yesterday 
1529,and  by jove  the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died only yesterday  nay  this very minute  i saw her and him in the same instant of time  his death and her sorrow  i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death  do you understand  i saw them together  i heard them together 
1530,she had said  with a deep catch of the breath   i have survived   while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly  mingled with her tone of despairing regret  the summing up whisper of his eternal condemnation 
1531,i asked myself what i was doing there  with a sensation of panic in my heart as though i had blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold 
1532,she motioned me to a chair 
1533,we sat down 
1534,i laid the packet gently on the little table  and she put her hand over it 
1535,       you knew him well   she murmured  after a moment of mourning silence 
1536,  intimacy grows quick out there   i said 
1537, i knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another  
1538,  and you admired him   she said 
1539, it was impossible to know him and not to admire him  was it  
1540,  he was a remarkable man   i said  unsteadily 
1541,then before the appealing fixity of her gaze  that seemed to watch for more words on my lips  i went on   it was impossible not to   
1542,  love him   she finished eagerly  silencing me into an appalled dumbness 
1543, how true  how true  but when you think that no one knew him so well as i  i had all his noble confidence  i knew him best  
1544,  you knew him best   i repeated 
1545,and perhaps she did 
1546,but with every word spoken the room was growing darker  and only her forehead  smooth and white  remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief and love 
1547,  you were his friend   she went on 
1548, his friend   she repeated  a little louder 
1549, you must have been  if he had given you this  and sent you to me  i feel i can speak to you  and oh  i must speak  i want you  you who have heard his last words  to know i have been worthy of him        it is not pride        yes  i am proud to know i understood him better than anyone on earth  he told me so himself  and since his mother died i have had no one  no one  to  to   
1550, i listened 
1551,the darkness deepened 
1552,i was not even sure whether he had given me the right bundle 
1553,i rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of his papers which  after his death  i saw the manager examining under the lamp 
1554,and the girl talked  easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy  she talked as thirsty men drink 
1555,i had heard that her engagement with kurtz had been disapproved by her people 
1556,he was not rich enough or something 
1557,and indeed i do not know whether he had not been a pauper all his life 
1558,he had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there 
1559,who was not his friend who had heard him speak once   she was saying 
1560, he drew men towards him by what was best in them  
1561,she looked at me with intensity 
1562, it is the gift of the great   she went on  and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds  full of mystery  desolation  and sorrow  i had ever heard  the ripple of the river  the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind  the murmurs of wild crowds  the faint ring of incomprehensible words cried from afar  the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness 
1563, but you have heard him  you know   she cried 
1564,  yes  i know   i said with something like despair in my heart  but bowing my head before the faith that was in her  before that great and saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness  in the triumphant darkness from which i could not have defended her  from which i could not even defend myself 
1565,  what a loss to me  to us    she corrected herself with beautiful generosity  then added in a murmur   to the world  
1566,by the last gleams of twilight i could see the glitter of her eyes  full of tears  of tears that would not fall 
1567,  i have been very happy  very fortunate  very proud   she went on 
1568, too fortunate  too happy for a little while  and now i am unhappy for  for life  
1569, she stood up  her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a glimmer of gold 
1570,i rose too 
1571,  and of all this   she went on  mournfully   of all his promise  and of all his greatness  of his generous mind  of his noble heart  nothing remains  nothing but a memory  you and i   
1572,  we shall always remember him   i said  hastily 
1573,  no   she cried 
1574, it is impossible that all this should be lost  that such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing  but sorrow  you know what vast plans he had  i knew of them too  i could not perhaps understand   but others knew of them  something must remain  his words  at least  have not died  
1575,  his words will remain   i said 
1576,  and his example   she whispered to herself 
1577, men looked up to him   his goodness shone in every act  his example   
1578,  true   i said   his example too  yes  his example  i forgot that  
1579,  but i do not 
1580,i cannot  i cannot believe  not yet 
1581,i cannot believe that i shall never see him again  that nobody will see him again  never  never  never 
1582, she put out her arms as if after a retreating figure  stretching them black and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of the window 
1583,never see him 
1584,i saw him clearly enough then 
1585,i shall see this eloquent phantom as long as i live  and i shall see her too  a tragic and familiar shade  resembling in this gesture another one  tragic also  and bedecked with powerless charms  stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream  the stream of darkness 
1586,she said suddenly very low   he died as he lived 
1587,  his end   said i  with dull anger stirring in me   was in every way worthy of his life  
1588,  and i was not with him   she murmured 
1589,my anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity 
1590,  everything that could be done   
1591,i mumbled 
1592,  ah  but i believed in him more than anyone on earth  more than his own mother  more than  himself 
1593,he needed me 
1594,i would have treasured every sigh  every word  every sign  every glance 
1595, i felt like a chill grip on my chest 
1596, do not   i said  in a muffled voice 
1597,  forgive me 
1598,i  i  have mourned so long in silence  in silence        you were with him  to the last 
1599,i think of his loneliness 
1600,nobody near to understand him as i would have understood 
1601,perhaps no one to hear
1602,  to the very end   i said  shakily 
1603, i heard his very last words        
1604,i stopped in a fright 
1605,  repeat them   she said in a heart broken tone 
1606, i want  i want  something  something  to  to live with  
1607, i was on the point of crying at her   do not you hear them  
1608,the dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us  in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind 
1609, the horror  the horror  
1610,  his last word  to live with   she murmured   do not you understand i loved him  i loved him  i loved him  
1611, i pulled myself together and spoke slowly 
1612,  the last word he pronounced was  your name 
1613, i heard a light sigh  and then my heart stood still  stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry  by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain   i knew it  i was sure         she knew  she was sure  i heard her weeping  she had hidden her face in her hands  it seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape  that the heavens would fall upon my head  but nothing happened  the heavens do not fall for such a trifle  would they have fallen  i wonder  if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due  had not he said he wanted only justice  but i could not  i could not tell her  it would have been too dark  too dark altogether        
1614,marlow ceased  and sat apart  indistinct and silent  in the pose of a meditating buddha 
1615,nobody moved for a time 
1616, we have lost the first of the ebb   said the director  suddenly 
1617,i raised my head 
1618,the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds  and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under an overcast sky  seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
