0,0,0,0,318,636,"The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide.

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.
The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
and the greatest, town on earth.

The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

Between us there was, as have already said somewhere, the bond of
the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's
yarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,
because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow
sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had
sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the
Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded
rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the
gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more somber
every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.

And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,
as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men.

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled
and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from
the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be
visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,
to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never
returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from
Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;
kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the
dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals""
of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all
had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,
messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river
into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed
of commonwealths, the germs of empires.

The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear
along the shore. The Chapman lighthouse, a three-legged thing erect on a
mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a great
stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper
reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on
the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.

""And this also,"" said Marlow suddenly, ""has been one of the dark places
of the earth.""

He was the only man of us who still ""followed the sea."" The worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a
seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home
order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.
For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine.

His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.
It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and
presently he said, very slow--

""was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here,
nineteen hundred years ago--the other day. . . . Light came out of this
river since--you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on
a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the
flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But
darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of
a fine--what d'ye call 'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered
suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in
charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a wonderful lot of handy
men they must have been too--used to build, apparently by the hundred,
in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here--the
very end of the world, a sea the color of lead, a sky the color of
smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina--and going up this
river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sandbanks, marshes,
forests, savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,
nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going
ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a
needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and
death,--death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must
have been dying like flies here. Oh yes--he did it. Did it very well,
too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except
afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.
They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered
by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna
by-and-by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful
climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too
much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or
tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,
march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the
utter savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of
wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And
it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination
of the abomination--you know. Imagine the growing regrets, the longing
to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.""

He paused.

""Mind,"" he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the
hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the
pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a
lotus-flower--""Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves
us is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not
much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was
merely a squeeze, and nothing more, suspect. They were conquerors, and
for that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have
it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to
be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great
scale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle
a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking
it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter
noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too
much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not
a sentimental pretense but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the
idea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a
sacrifice to. . . .""

He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red
flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each
other--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,
waiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in
a hesitating voice, ""suppose you fellows remember did once turn
fresh-water sailor for a bit,"" that we knew we were fated, before
the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive
experiences.

""don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,""
he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to
hear; ""yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how got out there, what saw, how went up that river to the place where first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of
light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was somber enough
too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear either.
No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.

""had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of
Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years
or so, and was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and
invading your homes, just as though had got a heavenly mission to
civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit did get
tired of resting. Then began to look for a ship--should think the
hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And got
tired of that game too.

""Now when was a little chap had a passion for maps. would look for
hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all
the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on
the earth, and when saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map
(but they all look that) would put my finger on it and say, 'When
grow up will go there.' The North Pole was one of these places, remember. Well, haven't been there yet, and shall not try now. The
glamour's off. Other places were scattered about the Equator, and in
every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres. have been in some
of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that. But there was one
yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that had a hankering
after.

""True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled
since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be
a blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream
gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it
one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map,
resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its
body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the
depths of the land. And as looked at the map of it in a shop-window,
it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.
Dash it all! thought to myself, they can't trade without using some
kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't try to get charge of one? went on along Fleet Street, but could not
shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.

""You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but
have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it's cheap
and not so nasty as it looks, they say.

""am sorry to own began to worry them. This was already a fresh
departure for me. was not used to get things that way, you know. always went my own road and on my own legs where had a mind to go. wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--felt somehow
must get there by hook or by crook. So worried them. The men said
'My dear fellow,' and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--tried
the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.
Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul. She wrote: 'It will be delightful. am ready to do
anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. know the wife of a
very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,' &c., &c. She was determined to make no end of fuss
to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

""got my appointment--of course; and got it very quick. It appears
the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the
more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,
two black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise
me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that
Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people
watched him, thunderstruck, till some man,--was told the chief's
son,--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,
the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of
the engineer, believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about Fresleven's remains, till got out and stepped into his shoes. couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped
black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity
had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had
scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had
never returned. What became of the hens don't know either. should
think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this
glorious affair got my appointment, before had fairly begun to hope
for it.

""flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the
contract. In a very few hours arrived in a city that always makes me
think of a whited sepulcher. Prejudice no doubt. had no difficulty in
finding the Company's offices. It was the biggest thing in the town,
and everybody met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea
empire, and make no end of coin by trade.

""A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable
windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting between
the stones, imposing carriage archways right and left, immense double
doors standing ponderously ajar. slipped through one of these cracks,
went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and
opened the first door came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim,
sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up
and walked straight at me--still knitting with downcast eyes--and only
just as began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a
somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an
umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me
into a waiting-room. gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in
the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining
map, marked with all the colors of a rainbow. There was a vast amount of
red--good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work
is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of
orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly
pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, wasn't going
into any of these. was going into the yellow. Dead in the center. And
the river was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake. Ough! A door
opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate
expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the
sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in
the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale
plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five feet
six, should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many
millions. He shook hands, fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with
my French. Bon voyage.

""In about forty-five seconds found myself again in the waiting-room
with the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy,
made me sign some document. believe undertook amongst other things
not to disclose any trade secrets. Well, am not going to.

""began to feel slightly uneasy. You know am not used to such
ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It
was just as though had been let into some conspiracy--don't
know--something not quite right; and was glad to get out. In the outer
room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving,
and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The
old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on
a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched
white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed
spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the
glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.
Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over,
and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She
seemed to know all about them and about me too. An eerie feeling came
over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there thought
of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for
a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown,
the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old
eyes. Ave! Old knitter of black wool. Morituri te salutant. Not many of
those she looked at ever saw her again--not half, by a long way.

""There was yet a visit to the doctor. 'A simple formality,' assured me
the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows.
Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some
clerk suppose,--there must have been clerks in the business, though
the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead,--came from
somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with
ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and
billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a
little too early for the doctor, so proposed a drink, and thereupon he
developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified
the Company's business, and by-and-by expressed casually my surprise
at him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at
once. 'am not such a fool as look, quoth Plato to his disciples,'
he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we
rose.

""The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else
the while. 'Good, good for there,' he mumbled, and then with a certain
eagerness asked me whether would let him measure my head. Rather
surprised, said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got
the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He
was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with
his feet in slippers, and thought him a harmless fool. 'always ask
leave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those going
out there,' he said. 'And when they come back, too?' asked. 'Oh, never see them,' he remarked; 'and, moreover, the changes take place
inside, you know.' He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. 'So you are
going out there. Famous. Interesting too.' He gave me a searching
glance, and made another note. 'Ever any madness in your family?' he
asked, in a matter-of-fact tone. felt very annoyed. 'Is that question
in the interests of science too?' 'It would be,' he said, without taking
notice of my irritation, 'interesting for science to watch the mental
changes of individuals, on the spot, but . . .' 'Are you an alienist?' interrupted. 'Every doctor should be--a little,' answered that original,
imperturbably. 'have a little theory which you Messieurs who go out
there must help me to prove. This is my share in the advantages my
country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency.
The mere wealth leave to others. Pardon my questions, but you are
the first Englishman coming under my observation. . . .' hastened
to assure him was not in the least typical. 'If were,' said I,
'wouldn't be talking like this with you.' 'What you say is rather
profound, and probably erroneous,' he said, with a laugh. 'Avoid
irritation more than exposure to the sun. Adieu. How do you English
say, eh? Good-by. Ah! Good-by. Adieu. In the tropics one must before
everything keep calm.' . . . He lifted a warning forefinger. . . . 'Du
calme, du calme. Adieu.'

""One thing more remained to do--say good-by to my excellent aunt. found her triumphant. had a cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for
many days--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would
expect a lady's drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the
fireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me
had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness
knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted
creature--a piece of good fortune for the Company--a man you don't get
hold of every day. Good heavens! and was going to take charge of a
two-penny-halfpenny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! It
appeared, however, was also one of the Workers, with a capital--you
know. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort
of apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk
just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush
of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about 'weaning
those ignorant millions from their horrid ways,' till, upon my word, she
made me quite uncomfortable. ventured to hint that the Company was run
for profit.

""'You forget, dear Charlie, that the laborer is worthy of his hire,' she
said, brightly. It's queer how out of touch with truth women are. They
live in a world of their own, and there had never been anything like it,
and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to
set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded
fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of
creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.

""After this got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write
often, and so on--and left. In the street--don't know why--a queer
feeling came to me that was an impostor. Odd thing that I, who used to
clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours' notice, with
less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a
moment--won't say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this
commonplace affair. The best way can explain it to you is by saying
that, for a second or two, felt as though, instead of going to the
center of a continent, were about to set off for the center of the
earth.

""left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they
have out there, for, as far as could see, the sole purpose of landing
soldiers and custom-house officers. watched the coast. Watching a
coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There
it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or
savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, 'Come and find out.'
This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with
an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so
dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight,
like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was
blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to
glisten and drip with steam. Here and there grayish-whitish specks
showed up, clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above
them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than
pin-heads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded
along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to
levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed
and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the
custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, heard, got drowned in the surf;
but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They
were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast
looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various
places--trading places--with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo, names
that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister
backcloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these
men with whom had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the
uniform somberness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth
of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The
voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the
speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that
had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary
contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see
from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang;
their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque
masks--these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an
intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf
along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a
great comfort to look at. For a time would feel belonged still to
a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long.
Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, remember, we came upon
a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn't even a shed there, and
she was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars
going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles
of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy,
slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin
masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was,
incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the
eight-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little
white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble
screech--and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch
of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the
sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me
earnestly there was a camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden
out of sight somewhere.

""We gave her her letters (heard the men in that lonely ship were dying
of fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at some more
places with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade
goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb;
all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature
herself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams
of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters,
thickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves, that seemed to
writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair. Nowhere did we
stop long enough to get a particularized impression, but the general
sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary
pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.

""It was upward of thirty days before saw the mouth of the big river.
We anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin
till some two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as could made a
start for a place thirty miles higher up.

""had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a
Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a
young man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait.
As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously
at the shore. 'Been living there?' he asked. said, 'Yes.' 'Fine lot
these government chaps--are they not?' he went on, speaking English
with great precision and considerable bitterness. 'It is funny what some
people will do for a few francs a month. wonder what becomes of that
kind when it goes up country?' said to him expected to see that
soon. 'So-o-o!' he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead
vigilantly. 'Don't be too sure,' he continued. 'The other day took
up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a Swede, too.'
'Hanged himself! Why, in God's name?' cried. He kept on looking
out watchfully. 'Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the country
perhaps.'

""At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up
earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others, with iron roofs, amongst a
waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of
the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A
lot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty
projected into the river. A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times
in a sudden recrudescence of glare. 'There's your Company's station,'
said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the
rocky slope. 'will send your things up. Four boxes did you say? So.
Farewell.'

""came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path
leading up the hill. It turned aside for the bowlders, and also for an
undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in
the air. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some
animal. came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty
rails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark things
seemed to stir feebly. blinked, the path was steep. A horn tooted to
the right, and saw the black people run. A heavy and dull detonation
shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and that was
all. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were building a
railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless
blasting was all the work going on.

""A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men
advanced in a file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow,
balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept
time with their footsteps. Black rags were wound round their loins, and
the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails. could see every
rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an
iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain
whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking. Another report
from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war had seen
firing into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous voice; but
these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. They
were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells,
had come to them, an insoluble mystery from over the sea. All their
meager breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered,
the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me within six inches,
without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy
savages. Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed, the product of
the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its
middle. He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white
man on the path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This
was simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that
he could not tell who might be. He was speedily reassured, and with a
large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take
me into partnership in his exalted trust. After all, also was a part
of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.

""Instead of going up, turned and descended to the left. My idea was to
let that chain-gang get out of sight before climbed the hill. You know
am not particularly tender; I've had to strike and to fend off.
I've had to resist and to attack sometimes--that's only one way of
resisting--without counting the exact cost, according to the demands
of such sort of life as had blundered into. I've seen the devil of
violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by
all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed
and drove men--men, tell you. But as stood on this hillside, foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land would become
acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and
pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, was only to find out
several months later and a thousand miles farther. For a moment stood appalled, as though by a warning. Finally descended the hill,
obliquely, towards the trees had seen.

""avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the
slope, the purpose of which found it impossible to divine. It wasn't
a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have
been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals
something to do. don't know. Then nearly fell into a very narrow
ravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside. discovered that
a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in
there. There wasn't one that was not broken. It was a wanton smash-up.
At last got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade
for a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me had stepped
into a gloomy circle of some Inferno. The rapids were near, and an
uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful
stillness of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved,
with a mysterious sound--as though the tearing pace of the launched
earth had suddenly become audible.

""Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees, leaning against the
trunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within
the dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair.
Another mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder of the
soil under my feet. The work was going on. The work! And this was the
place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die.

""They were dying slowly--it was very clear. They were not enemies, they
were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now,--nothing but black
shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish
gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality
of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar
food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl
away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air--and nearly as
thin. began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees. Then,
glancing down, saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined at
full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids
rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of
blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly.
The man seemed young--almost a boy--but you know with them it's hard to
tell. found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede's
ship's biscuits had in my pocket. The fingers closed slowly on it and
held--there was no other movement and no other glance. He had tied a
bit of white worsted round his neck--Why? Where did he get it? Was it a
badge--an ornament--a charm--a propitiatory act? Was there any idea at
all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck, this
bit of white thread from beyond the seas.

""Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs
drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing,
in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its
forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all about others
were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture
of a massacre or a pestilence. While stood horror-struck, one of these
creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards
the river to drink. He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the
sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after a time let his
woolly head fall on his breastbone.

""didn't want any more loitering in the shade, and made haste towards
the station. When near the buildings met a white man, in such an
unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment took him for
a sort of vision. saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light
alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clear necktie, and varnished boots. No
hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a
big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.

""shook hands with this miracle, and learned he was the Company's
chief accountant, and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station.
He had come out for a moment, he said, 'to get a breath of fresh air.'
The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary
desk-life. wouldn't have mentioned the fellow to you at all, only
it was from his lips that first heard the name of the man who is
so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time. Moreover, respected the fellow. Yes; respected his collars, his vast cuffs,
his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser's
dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up
his appearance. That's backbone. His starched collars and got-up
shirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out nearly
three years; and, later on, could not help asking him how he managed
to sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly,
'I've been teaching one of the native women about the station. It
was difficult. She had a distaste for the work.' This man had verily
accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in
apple-pie order.

""Everything else in the station was in a muddle,--heads, things,
buildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and
departed; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads,
and brass-wire sent into the depths of darkness, and in return came a
precious trickle of ivory.

""had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity. lived in a
hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos would sometimes get into
the accountant's office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly
put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from
neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to
open the big shutter to see. It was hot there too; big flies buzzed
fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. sat generally on the
floor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented),
perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for
exercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalided agent from
up-country) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. 'The
groans of this sick person,' he said, 'distract my attention. And without
that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this
climate.'

""One day he remarked, without lifting his head, 'In the interior you
will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.' On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he
said he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at
this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, 'He is a very
remarkable person.' Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz
was at present in charge of a trading post, a very important one, in the
true ivory-country, at 'the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory
as all the others put together. . . .' He began to write again. The sick
man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace.

""Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of
feet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst
out on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking
together, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the
chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tearfully for the twentieth time
that day. . . . He rose slowly. 'What a frightful row,' he said. He
crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to
me, 'He does not hear.' 'What! Dead?' asked, startled. 'No, not yet,'
he answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the
head to the tumult in the station-yard, 'When one has got to make
correct entries, one comes to hate those savages--hate them to the
death.' He remained thoughtful for a moment. 'When you see Mr. Kurtz,'
he went on, 'tell him from me that everything here'--he glanced at the
desk--'is very satisfactory. don't like to write to him--with those
messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter--at
that Central Station.' He stared at me for a moment with his mild,
bulging eyes. 'Oh, he will go far, very far,' he began again. 'He
will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above--the
Council in Europe, you know--mean him to be.'

""He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently
in going out stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the
homeward-bound agent was lying flushed and insensible; the other,
bent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct
transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep could see the still
tree-tops of the grove of death.

""Next day left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for
a two-hundred-mile tramp.

""No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a
stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through
long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly
ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a
solitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long
time ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of
fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between Deal and
Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for
them, fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very
soon. Only here the dwellings were gone too. Still passed through
several abandoned villages. There's something pathetically childish in
the ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of
sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp,
cook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness,
at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and
his long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above.
Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking,
swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing, suggestive,
and wild--and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells
in a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform,
camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very
hospitable and festive--not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep
of the road, he declared. Can't say saw any road or any upkeep, unless
the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead,
upon which absolutely stumbled three miles farther on, may be
considered as a permanent improvement. had a white companion too, not
a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of
fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade
and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over
a man's head while he is coming-to. couldn't help asking him once what
he meant by coming there at all. 'To make money, of course. What do you
think?' he said, scornfully. Then he got fever, and had to be carried in
a hammock slung under a pole. As he weighed sixteen stone had no end
of rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their
loads in the night--quite a mutiny. So, one evening, made a speech in
English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of
eyes before me, and the next morning started the hammock off in front
all right. An hour afterwards came upon the whole concern wrecked in
a bush--man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had
skinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody,
but there wasn't the shadow of a carrier near. remembered the old
doctor,--'It would be interesting for science to watch the mental
changes of individuals, on the spot.' felt was becoming
scientifically interesting. However, all that is to no purpose. On the
fifteenth day came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into
the Central Station. It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and
forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three
others inclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was all the
gate it had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see
the flabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in
their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up
to take a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of
them, a stout, excitable chap with black mustaches, informed me with
great volubility and many digressions, as soon as told him who was,
that my steamer was at the bottom of the river. was thunderstruck.
What, how, why? Oh, it was 'all right.' The 'manager himself' was there.
All quite correct. 'Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly!'--'you
must,' he said in agitation, 'go and see the general manager at once. He
is waiting!'

""did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. fancy see it now, but am not sure--not at all. Certainly the affair was too
stupid--when think of it--to be altogether natural. Still. . . . But
at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The
steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry
up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer
skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom
out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. asked myself
what was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, had
plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. had to set about
it the very next day. That, and the repairs when brought the pieces to
the station, took some months.

""My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to
sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in
complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle
size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps
remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as
trenchant and heavy as an ax. But even at these times the rest of his
person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only
an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy--a
smile--not a smile--remember it, but can't explain. It was
unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it
got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like
a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase
appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth
up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired
neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That
was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing
more. You have no idea how effective such a . . . a . . . faculty can
be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even.
That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station.
He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to
him--why? Perhaps because he was never ill . . . He had served three
terms of three years out there . . . Because triumphant health in the
general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went
home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously. Jack ashore--with
a difference--in externals only. This one could gather from his casual
talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's
all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was
impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that
secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion
made one pause--for out there there were no external checks. Once when
various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the
station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out here should have no
entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though
it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping.
You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When annoyed at
meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence,
he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house
had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where he sat was the
first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable
conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed
his 'boy'--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the white
men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.

""He began to speak as soon as he saw me. had been very long on the
road. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations
had to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did
not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on--and so on,
and so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with
a stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation
was 'very grave, very grave.' There were rumors that a very important
station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was
not true. Mr. Kurtz was . . . felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz,
thought. interrupted him by saying had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the
coast. 'Ah! So they talk of him down there,' he murmured to himself.
Then he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an
exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore
could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.'
Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, 'Ah, Mr.
Kurtz!' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumbfounded by the
accident. Next thing he wanted to know 'how long it would take to' . . .
interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet
too, was getting savage. 'How could tell,' said. 'hadn't even
seen the wreck yet--some months, no doubt.' All this talk seemed to me
so futile. 'Some months,' he said. 'Well, let us say three months before
we can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.' flung out
of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda)
muttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering idiot.
Afterwards took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly
with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the
'affair.'

""went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that
station. In that way only it seemed to me could keep my hold on the
redeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then
saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine
of the yard. asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered
here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot
of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word 'ivory'
rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were
praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a
whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in
my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared
speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like
evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic
invasion.

""Oh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One
evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and don't
know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have
thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that
trash. was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw
them all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when
the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin
pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly,
splendidly,' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.

""strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like
a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame
had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and
collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A
nigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in
some way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. saw him,
later on, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick
and trying to recover himself: afterwards he arose and went out--and
the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As approached the glow from the dark found myself at the back of two men,
talking. heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, 'take
advantage of this unfortunate accident.' One of the men was the manager.
wished him a good evening. 'Did you ever see anything like it--eh? it
is incredible,' he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was
a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked
little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other
agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's spy upon them.
As to me, had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and
by-and-by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to
his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck
a match, and perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a
silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself.
Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any
right to candles. Native mats covered the clay walls; a collection of
spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies. The business
intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks--so had been
informed; but there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the
station, and he had been there more than a year--waiting. It seems he
could not make bricks without something, don't know what--straw maybe.
Anyways, it could not be found there, and as it was not likely to be
sent from Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for.
An act of special creation perhaps. However, they were all waiting--all
the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them--for something; and upon my word
it did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it,
though the only thing that ever came to them was disease--as far as could see. They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against
each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about
that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as
everything else--as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern, as
their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real
feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory
was to be had, so that they could earn percentages. They intrigued
and slandered and hated each other only on that account,--but as to
effectually lifting a little finger--oh, no. By heavens! there is
something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while
another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very
well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking
at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a
kick.

""had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in there
it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something--in
fact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people was
supposed to know there--putting leading questions as to my acquaintances
in the sepulchral city, and so on. His little eyes glittered like
mica discs--with curiosity,--though he tried to keep up a bit of
superciliousness. At first was astonished, but very soon became
awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. couldn't
possibly imagine what had in me to make it worth his while. It was
very pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full
of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat
business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless
prevaricator. At last he got angry, and to conceal a movement of furious
annoyance, he yawned. rose. Then noticed a small sketch in oils,
on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a
lighted torch. The background was somber--almost black. The movement of
the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face was
sinister.

""It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding a half-pint champagne
bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my question he
said Mr. Kurtz had painted this--in this very station more than a year
ago--while waiting for means to go to his trading-post. 'Tell me, pray,'
said I, 'who is this Mr. Kurtz?'

""'The chief of the Inner Station,' he answered in a short tone, looking
away. 'Much obliged,' said, laughing. 'And you are the brickmaker of
the Central Station. Everyone knows that.' He was silent for a while.
'He is a prodigy,' he said at last. 'He is an emissary of pity, and
science, and progress, and devil knows what else. We want,' he began
to declaim suddenly, 'for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by
Europe, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness
of purpose.' 'Who says that?' asked. 'Lots of them,' he replied. 'Some
even write that; and so _he_ comes here, a special being, as you ought
to know.' 'Why ought to know?' interrupted, really surprised. He
paid no attention. 'Yes. To-day he is chief of the best station, next
year he will be assistant-manager, two years more and . . . but dare
say you know what he will be in two years' time. You are of the new
gang--the gang of virtue. The same people who sent him specially also
recommended you. Oh, don't say no. I've my own eyes to trust.' Light
dawned upon me. My dear aunt's influential acquaintances were producing
an unexpected effect upon that young man. nearly burst into a laugh.
'Do you read the Company's confidential correspondence?' asked. He
hadn't a word to say. It was great fun. 'When Mr. Kurtz,' continued
severely, 'is General Manager, you won't have the opportunity.'

""He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had
risen. Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on
the glow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the
moonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere. 'What a row the brute
makes!' said the indefatigable man with the mustaches, appearing
near us. 'Serve him right. Transgression--punishment--bang! Pitiless,
pitiless. That's the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations
for the future. was just telling the manager . . .' He noticed my
companion, and became crestfallen all at once. 'Not in bed yet,'
he said, with a kind of servile heartiness; 'it's so natural. Ha!
Danger--agitation.' He vanished. went on to the river-side, and
the other followed me. heard a scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap
of muffs--go to.' The pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating,
discussing. Several had still their staves in their hands. verily
believe they took these sticks to bed with them. Beyond the fence the
forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir,
through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of
the land went home to one's very heart,--its mystery, its greatness,
the amazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned feebly
somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my
pace away from there. felt a hand introducing itself under my arm.
'My dear sir,' said the fellow, 'don't want to be misunderstood, and
especially by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before can have that
pleasure. wouldn't like him to get a false idea of my
disposition. . . .'


""let him run on, this _papier-mache_ Mephistopheles, and it seemed to
me that if tried could poke my forefinger through him, and would find
nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don't you see, had
been planning to be assistant-manager by-and-by under the present man,
and could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a
little. He talked precipitately, and did not try to stop him. had my
shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a
carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud,
by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was
before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon
had spread over everything a thin layer of silver--over the rank grass,
over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than
the wall of a temple, over the great river could see through a somber
gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur.
All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about
himself. wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity
looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we
who had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it
handle us? felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that
couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? could
see a little ivory coming out from there, and had heard Mr. Kurtz was
in there. had heard enough about it too--God knows! Yet somehow it
didn't bring any image with it--no more than if had been told an angel
or a fiend was in there. believed it in the same way one of you might
believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. knew once a Scotch
sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you
asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy
and mutter something about 'walking on all-fours.' If you as much as
smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to fight you. would not
have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but went for him near enough
to a lie. You know hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because
am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me.
There is a taint of death, a flavor of mortality in lies,--which is
exactly what hate and detest in the world--what want to forget.
It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do.
Temperament, suppose. Well, went near enough to it by letting the
young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence
in Europe. became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of
the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because had a notion it somehow
would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time did not see--you
understand. He was just a word for me. did not see the man in the name
any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see
anything? It seems to me am trying to tell you a dream--making a vain
attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation,
that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of
struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which
is of the very essence of dreams. . . .""

He was silent for a while.

"". . . No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the
life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence,--that which
makes its truth, its meaning--its subtle and penetrating essence. It is
impossible. We live, as we dream--alone. . . .""

He paused again as if reflecting, then added--""Of course in this you
fellows see more than could then. You see me, whom you know. . . .""

It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one
another. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more
to us than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. The others might
have been asleep, but was awake. listened, listened on the watch
for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clew to the
faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself
without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.

"". . . Yes--let him run on,"" Marlow began again, ""and think what
he pleased about the powers that were behind me. did! And there was
nothing behind me! There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled
steamboat was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the
necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you
conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal
genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate
tools--intelligent men.' He did not make bricks--why, there was a
physical impossibility in the way--as was well aware; and if he
did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man
rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did see it? saw
it. What more did want? What really wanted was rivets, by heaven!
Rivets. To get on with the work--to stop the hole. Rivets wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled
up--burst--split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that
station yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death.
You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping
down--and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had
plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week
the messenger, a lone negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand,
left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan
came in with trade goods,--ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder
only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded
spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have
brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.

""He was becoming confidential now, but fancy my unresponsive attitude
must have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform
me he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. said could see that very well, but what wanted was a certain quantity of
rivets--and rivets were what really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only
known it. Now letters went to the coast every week. . . . 'My dear
sir,' he cried, 'write from dictation.' demanded rivets. There was
a way--for an intelligent man. He changed his manner; became very
cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether
sleeping on board the steamer (stuck to my salvage night and day)
wasn't disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of
getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds.
The pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could
lay hands on at him. Some even had sat up o' nights for him. All this
energy was wasted, though. 'That animal has a charmed life,' he said;
'but you can say this only of brutes in this country. No man--you
apprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life.' He stood there for
a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little
askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt
Good night, he strode off. could see he was disturbed and considerably
puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than had been for days. It
was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend, the
battered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. clambered on board. She
rang under my feet like an empty Huntley & Palmer biscuit-tin kicked
along a gutter; she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty
in shape, but had expended enough hard work on her to make me love
her. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given
me a chance to come out a bit--to find out what could do. No, don't
like work. had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that
can be done. don't like work--no man does--but like what is in the
work,--the chance to find yourself. Your own reality--for yourself, not
for others--what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere
show, and never can tell what it really means.

""was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with
his legs dangling over the mud. You see rather chummed with the few
mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally
despised--on account of their imperfect manners, suppose. This was the
foreman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good worker. He was a lank, bony,
yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his
head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed
to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality,
for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young
children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out
there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an
enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work
hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his
children and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under
the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind
of white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to go over
his ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing
that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on
a bush to dry.

""slapped him on the back and shouted, 'We shall have rivets!' He
scrambled to his feet exclaiming 'No! Rivets!' as though he couldn't
believe his ears. Then in a low voice, 'You . . . eh?' don't know why
we behaved like lunatics. put my finger to the side of my nose and
nodded mysteriously. 'Good for you!' he cried, snapped his fingers above
his head, lifting one foot. tried a jig. We capered on the iron deck.
A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on
the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the
sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their
hovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager's hut,
vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished too.
We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet
flowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great wall of
vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves,
boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting
invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested,
ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out
of his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty
splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had
been taking a bath of glitter in the great river. 'After all,' said the
boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't we get the rivets?'
Why not, indeed! did not know of any reason why we shouldn't. 'They'll
come in three weeks,' said confidently.

""But they didn't. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an
infliction, a visitation. It came in sections during the next three
weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new
clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the
impressed pilgrims. A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on
the heels of the donkeys; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white
cases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of
mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station. Five such
installments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the
loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one
would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for
equitable division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in
themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.

""This devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and
believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk
of sordid buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without
audacity, and cruel without courage; there was not an atom of foresight
or of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not
seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world. To tear
treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more
moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into
a safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise don't know; but
the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.

""In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighborhood, and his eyes
had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with ostentation
on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the station
spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two roaming about
all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab.

""had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One's capacity for
that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose. said
Hang!--and let things slide. had plenty of time for meditation,
and now and then would give some thought to Kurtz. wasn't very
interested in him. No. Still, was curious to see whether this man, who
had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to the
top after all, and how he would set about his work when there.""",the nellie  a cruising yawl  swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails  and was at rest  the flood had made  the wind was

had a hankering after    true  by this time it was not a blank space any more  it had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names  it had ceased to be a blank space of delightful

immense snake uncoiled  with its head in the sea  its body at rest curving afar over a vast country  and its tail lost in the depths of the land  and as looked at the map of it in a shop window  it fascinated me as a snake would a bird  a silly little bird  then remembered there was a big concern  a company for trade on that river  dash it all  thought to myself  they cannot trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water  steamboats  why should not try to get charge of one  went on along fleet street  but could not shake off the idea  the snake had charmed me    you understand it was a continental concern  that trading society  but have a lot of relations living on the continent  because it is cheap and not so nasty as it looks  they say    am sorry to own began to worry them  this was already a fresh departure for me  was not used to get things that way  you know  always went my own road and on my own legs where had a mind to go  would not have believed it

fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat  if such was my fancy    got my appointment  of course  and got it very quick  it appears the company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives  this was my chance  and it made me the more anxious to go  it was only months and months afterwards  when made the attempt to recover what was left of the body  that heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens  yes  two black hens  fresleven  that was the fellow own name  a dane  thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain  so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick  oh  it did not surprise me in the least to hear this  and at the same time to be told that fresleven was the gentlest  quietest creature that ever walked on two legs  no doubt he was  but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble because  you know  and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self respect in some way  therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly  while a big crowd of his people watched him  thunderstruck  till some man   was told the chief own son   in desperation at hearing the old chap yell  made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man  and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder blades  then the whole population cleared into the forest  expecting all kinds of calamities to happen  while  on the other hand  the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic  in charge of the engineer  believe  afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about fresleven own remains  till got out and stepped into his shoes  could not let it rest  though  but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor  the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones  they were all there  the supernatural being had not been touched after he fell  and the village was deserted  the huts gaped black  rotting  all askew within the fallen enclosures  a calamity had come to it  sure enough  the people had vanished  mad terror had scattered them  men  women  and children  through the bush  and they had never returned  what became of the hens do not know either  should think the because of progress got them  anyhow  however  through this glorious affair got my appointment  before had fairly begun to hope for it    flew around like mad to get ready  and before forty eight hours was crossing the channel to show myself to my employers  and sign the contract  in a very few hours arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulcher  prejudice no doubt  had no difficulty in finding the company own offices  it was the biggest thing in the town  and everybody met was full of it  they were going to run an over sea empire  and make no end of coin by trade    a narrow and deserted street in deep shadow  high houses  innumerable windows with venetian blinds  a dead silence  grass sprouting between the stones  imposing carriage archways right and left  immense double doors standing ponderously ajar  slipped through one of these cracks  went up a swept and ungarnished staircase  as arid as a desert  and opened the first door came to  two women  one fat and the other slim  sat on straw bottomed chairs  knitting black wool  the slim one got up and walked straight at me  still knitting with downcast eyes  and only just as began to think of getting out of her way  as you would for a somnambulist  stood still  and looked up  her dress was as plain as an umbrella cover  and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting room  gave my name  and looked about  deal table in the middle  plain chairs all round the walls  on one end a large shining map  marked with all the colors of a rainbow  there was a vast amount of red  good to see at any time  because one knows that some real work is done in there  a deuce of a lot of blue  a little green  smears of orange  and  on the east coast  a purple patch  to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager beer  however  was not going into any of these  was going into the yellow  dead in the center  and the river was there  fascinating  deadly  like a snake  ough  a door opened  a white haired secretarial head  but wearing a compassionate expression  appeared  and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary  its light was dim  and a heavy writing desk squatted in the middle  from behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock coat  the great man himself  he was five feet six  should judge  and had his grip on the handle end of ever so many millions  he shook hands  fancy  murmured vaguely  was satisfied with my french  bon voyage    in about forty five seconds found myself again in the waiting room with the compassionate secretary  who  full of desolation and sympathy  made me sign some document  believe undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets  well  am not going to    began to feel slightly uneasy  you know am not used to such ceremonies  and there was something ominous in the atmosphere  it was just as though had been let into some conspiracy  do not know  something not quite right  and was glad to get out  in the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly  people were arriving  and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them  the old one sat on her chair  her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot warmer  and a cat reposed on her lap  she wore a starched white affair on her head  had a wart on one cheek  and silver rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose  she glanced at me above the glasses  the swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me  two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over  and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom  she seemed to know all about them and about me too  an eerie feeling came over me  she seemed uncanny and fateful  often far away there thought of these two  guarding the door of darkness  knitting black wool as for a warm pall  one introducing  introducing continuously to the unknown  the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes  ave  old knitter of black wool  morituri te salutant  not many of those she looked at ever saw her again  not half  by a long way    there was yet a visit to the doctor   a simple formality   assured me the secretary  with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows  accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow  some clerk suppose   there must have been clerks in the business  though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead   came from somewhere up stairs  and led me forth  he was shabby and careless  with ink stains on the sleeves of his jacket  and his cravat was large and billowy  under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot  it was a little too early for the doctor  so proposed a drink  and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality  as we sat over our vermouths he glorified the company own business  and by and by expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there  he became very cool and collected all at once   not such a fool as look  quoth plato to his disciples   he said sententiously  emptied his glass with great resolution  and we rose    the old doctor felt my pulse  evidently thinking of something else the while   good  good for there   he mumbled  and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether would let him measure my head  rather surprised  said yes  when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way  taking notes carefully  he was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine  with his feet in slippers  and thought him a harmless fool   always ask leave  in the interests of science  to measure the crania of those going out there   he said   and when they come back  too   asked   oh  never see them   he remarked   and  moreover  the changes take place inside  you know   he smiled  as if at some quiet joke   owno you are going out there  famous  interesting too   he gave me a searching glance  and made another note   ever any madness in your family   he asked  in a matter of fact tone  felt very annoyed   is that question in the interests of science too    it would be   he said  without taking notice of my irritation   interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals  on the spot  but         are you an alienist   interrupted   every doctor should be  a little   answered that original  imperturbably   have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must help me to prove  this is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency  the mere wealth leave to others  pardon my questions  but you are the first englishman coming under my observation         hastened to assure him was not in the least typical   if were   said i   would not be talking like this with you    what you say is rather profound  and probably erroneous   he said  with a laugh   avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun  adieu  how do you english say  eh  good by  ah  good by  adieu  in the tropics one must before everything keep calm         he lifted a warning forefinger         du calme  du calme  adieu     one thing more remained to do  say good by to my excellent aunt  found her triumphant  had a cup of tea  the last decent cup of tea for many days  and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady own drawing room to look  we had a long quiet chat by the fireside  in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary  and goodness knows to how many more people besides  as an exceptional and gifted creature  a piece of good fortune for the company  a man you do not get hold of every day  good heavens  and was going to take charge of a two penny halfpenny river steamboat with a penny whistle attached  it appeared  however  was also one of the workers  with a capital  you know  something like an emissary of light  something like a lower sort of apostle  there had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time  and the excellent woman  living right in the rush of all that humbug  got carried off her feet  she talked about  weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways   till  upon my word  she made me quite uncomfortable  ventured to hint that the company was run for profit     you forget  dear charlie  that the laborer is worthy of his hire   she said  brightly  it is queer how out of touch with truth women are  they live in a world of their own  and there had never been anything like it  and never can be  it is too beautiful altogether  and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset  some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over    after this got embraced  told to wear flannel  be sure to write often  and so on  and left  in the street  do not know why  a queer feeling came to me that was an impostor  odd thing that i  who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty four hours  notice  with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street  had a moment  will not say of hesitation  but of startled pause  before this commonplace affair  the best way can explain it to you is by saying that  for a second or two  felt as though  instead of going to the center of a continent  were about to set off for the center of the earth    left in a french steamer  and she called in every blamed port they have out there  for  as far as could see  the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom house officers  watched the coast  watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma  there it is before you  smiling  frowning  inviting  grand  mean  insipid  or savage  and always mute with an air of whispering   come and find out   this one was almost featureless  as if still in the making  with an aspect of monotonous grimness  the edge of a colossal jungle  so dark green as to be almost black  fringed with white surf  ran straight  like a ruled line  far  far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist  the sun was fierce  the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam  here and there grayish whitish specks showed up  clustered inside the white surf  with a flag flying above them perhaps  settlements some centuries old  and still no bigger than pin heads on the untouched expanse of their background  we pounded along  stopped  landed soldiers  went on  landed custom house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a god forsaken wilderness  with a tin she would and a flag pole lost in it  landed more soldiers  to take care of the custom house clerks  presumably  some  heard  got drowned in the surf  but whether they did or not  nobody seemed particularly to care  they were just flung out there  and on we went  every day the coast looked the same  as though we had not moved  but we passed various places  trading places  with names like gran  bassam little popo  names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth  the idleness of a passenger  my isolation amongst all these men with whom had no point of contact  the oily and languid sea  the uniform somberness of the coast  seemed to keep me away from the truth of things  within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion  the voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure  like the speech of a brother  it was something natural  that had its reason  that had a meaning  now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality  it was paddled by black fellows  you could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening  they shouted  sang  their bodies streamed with perspiration  they had faces like grotesque masks  these chaps  but they had bone  muscle  a wild vitality  an intense energy of movement  that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast  they wanted no excuse for being there  they were a great comfort to look at  for a time would feel belonged still to a world of straightforward facts  but the feeling would not last long  something would turn up to scare it away  once  remember  we came upon a man of war anchored off the coast  there was not even a she would there  and she was shelling the bush  it appears the french had one of their wars going on thereabouts  her ensign dropped limp like a rag  the muzzles of the long eight inch guns stuck out all over the low hull  the greasy  slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down  swaying her thin masts  in the empty immensity of earth  sky  and water  there she was  incomprehensible  firing into a continent  pop  would go one of the eight inch guns  a small flame would dart and vanish  a little white smoke would disappear  a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech  and nothing happened  nothing could happen  there was a touch of insanity in the proceeding  a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight  and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives  he called them enemies   hidden out of sight somewhere    we gave her her letters  heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day  and went on  we called at some more places with farcical names  where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb  all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf  as if nature herself had tried to ward off intruders  in and out of rivers  streams of death in life  whose banks were rotting into mud  whose waters  thickened into slime  invaded the contorted mangroves  that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair  nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression  but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me  it was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares    it was upward of thirty days before saw the mouth of the big river  we anchored off the seat of the government  but my work would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on  so as soon as could made a start for a place thirty miles higher up    had my passage on a little sea going steamer  her captain was a swede  and knowing me for a seaman  invited me on the bridge  he was a young man  lean  fair  and morose  with lanky hair and a shuffling gait  as we left the miserable little wharf  he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore   been living there   he asked  said   yes    fine lot these government chaps  are they not   he went on  speaking english with great precision and considerable bitterness   it is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month  wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes up country   said to him expected to see that soon   owno o o   he exclaimed  he shuffled athwart  keeping one eye ahead vigilantly   do not be too sure   he continued   the other day took up a man who hanged himself on the road  he was a swede  too    hanged himself  why  in god own name   cried  he kept on looking out watchfully   who knows  the sun too much for him  or the country perhaps     at last we opened a reach  a rocky cliff appeared  mounds of turned up earth by the shore  houses on a hill  others  with iron roofs  amongst a waste of excavations  or hanging to the declivity  a continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation  a lot of people  mostly black and naked  moved about like ants  a jetty projected into the river  a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare   there is your company own station   said the swede  pointing to three wooden barrack like structures on the rocky slope   will send your things up  four boxes did you say  so  farewell     came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass  then found a path leading up the hill  it turned aside for the bowlders  and also for an undersized railway truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air  one was off  the thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal  came upon more pieces of decaying machinery  a stack of rusty rails  to the left a clump of trees made a shady spot  where dark things seemed to stir feebly  blinked  the path was steep  a horn tooted to the right  and saw the black people run  a heavy and dull detonation shook the ground  a puff of smoke came out of the cliff  and that was all  no change appeared on the face of the rock  they were building a railway  the cliff was not in the way or anything  but this objectless blasting was all the work going on    a slight clinking behind me made me turn my head  six black men advanced in a file  toiling up the path  they walked erect and slow  balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads  and the clink kept time with their footsteps  black rags were wound round their loins  and the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails  could see every rib  the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope  each had an iron collar on his neck  and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them  rhythmically clinking  another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war had seen firing into a continent  it was the same kind of ominous voice  but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies  they were called criminals  and the outraged law  like the bursting shells  had come to them  an insoluble mystery from over the sea  all their meager breasts panted together  the violently dilated nostrils quivered  the eyes stared stonily uphill  they passed me within six inches  without a glance  with that complete  deathlike indifference of unhappy savages  behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed  the product of the new forces at work  strolled despondently  carrying a rifle by its middle  he had a uniform jacket with one button off  and seeing a white man on the path  hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity  this was simple prudence  white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who might be  he was speedily reassured  and with a large  white  rascally grin  and a glance at his charge  seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust  after all  also was a part of the great because of these high and just proceedings    instead of going up  turned and descended to the left  my idea was to let that chain gang get out of sight before climbed the hill  you know am not particularly tender  I have had to strike and to fend off  I have had to resist and to attack sometimes  that is only one way of resisting  without counting the exact cost  according to the demands of such sort of life as had blundered into  I have seen the devil of violence  and the devil of greed  and the devil of hot desire  but  by all the stars  these were strong  lusty  red eyed devils  that swayed and drove men  men  tell you  but as stood on this hillside  foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land would become acquainted with a flabby  pretending  weak eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly  how insidious he could be  too  was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther  for a moment stood appalled  as though by a warning  finally descended the hill  obliquely  towards the trees had seen    avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope  the purpose of which found it impossible to divine  it was not a quarry or a sandpit  anyhow  it was just a hole  it might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do  do not know  then nearly fell into a very narrow ravine  almost no more than a scar in the hillside  discovered that a lot of imported drainage pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there  there was not one that was not broken  it was a wanton smash up  at last got under the trees  my purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment  but no sooner within than it seemed to me had stepped into a gloomy circle of some inferno  the rapids were near  and an uninterrupted  uniform  headlong  rushing noise filled the mournful stillness of the grove  where not a breath stirred  not a leaf moved  with a mysterious sound  as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible    black shapes crouched  lay  sat between the trees  leaning against the trunks  clinging to the earth  half coming out  half effaced within the dim light  in all the attitudes of pain  abandonment  and despair  another mine on the cliff went off  followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet  the work was going on  the work  and this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die    they were dying slowly  it was very clear  they were not enemies  they were not criminals  they were nothing earthly now   nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation  lying confusedly in the greenish gloom  brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts  lost in uncongenial surroundings  fed on unfamiliar food  they sickened  became inefficient  and were then allowed to crawl away and rest  these moribund shapes were free as air  and nearly as thin  began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees  then  glancing down  saw a face near my hand  the black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree  and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me  enormous and vacant  a kind of blind  white flicker in the depths of the orbs  which died out slowly  the man seemed young  almost a boy  but you know with them it is hard to tell  found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good swede own ship own biscuits had in my pocket  the fingers closed slowly on it and held  there was no other movement and no other glance  he had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck  why  where did he get it  was it a badge  an ornament  a charm  a propitiatory act  was there any idea at all connected with it  it looked startling round his black neck  this bit of white thread from beyond the seas    near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up  one  with his chin propped on his knees  stared at nothing  in an intolerable and appalling manner  his brother phantom rested its forehead  as if overcome with a great weariness  and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse  as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence  while stood horror struck  one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees  and went off on all fours towards the river to drink  he lapped out of his hand  then sat up in the sunlight  crossing his shins in front of him  and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone    did not want any more loitering in the shade  and made haste towards the station  when near the buildings met a white man  in such an unexpected elegance of get up that in the first moment took him for a sort of vision  saw a high starched collar  white cuffs  a light alpaca jacket  snowy trousers  a clear necktie  and varnished boots  no hat  hair parted  brushed  oiled  under a green lined parasol held in a big white hand  he was amazing  and had a penholder behind his ear    shook hands with this miracle  and learned he was the company own chief accountant  and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station  he had come out for a moment  he said   to get a breath of fresh air   the expression sounded wonderfully odd  with its suggestion of sedentary desk life  would not have mentioned the fellow to you at all  only it was from his lips that first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time  moreover  respected the fellow  yes  respected his collars  his vast cuffs  his brushed hair  his appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser own dummy  but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance  that is backbone  his starched collars and got up shirt fronts were achievements of character  he had been out nearly three years  and  later on  could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen  he had just the faintest blush  and said modestly   I have been teaching one of the native women about the station  it was difficult  she had a distaste for the work   this man had verily accomplished something  and he was devoted to his books  which were in apple pie order    everything else in the station was in a muddle   heads  things  buildings  strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed  a stream of manufactured goods  rubbishy cottons  beads  and brass wire sent into the depths of darkness  and in return came a precious trickle of ivory    had to wait in the station for ten days  an eternity  lived in a hut in the yard  but to be out of the chaos would sometimes get into the accountant own office  it was built of horizontal planks  and so badly put together that  as he bent over his high desk  he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight  there was no need to open the big shutter to see  it was hot there too  big flies buzzed fiendishly  and did not sting  but stabbed  sat generally on the floor  while  of faultless appearance  and even slightly scented   perching on a high stool  he wrote  he wrote  sometimes he stood up for exercise  when a truckle bed with a sick man  some invalided agent from up country  was put in there  he exhibited a gentle annoyance   the groans of this sick person   he said   distract my attention  and without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate     one day he remarked  without lifting his head   in the interior you will no doubt meet mr  kurtz   on my asking who mr  kurtz was  he said he was a first class agent  and seeing my disappointment at this information  he added slowly  laying down his pen   he is a very remarkable person   further questions elicited from him that mr  kurtz was at present in charge of a trading post  a very important one  in the true ivory country  at  the very bottom of there  sends in as much ivory as all the others put together         he began to write again  the sick man was too ill to groan  the flies buzzed in a great peace    suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet  a caravan had come in  a violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks  all the carriers were speaking together  and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard  giving it up  tearfully for the twentieth time that day        he rose slowly   what a frightful row   he said  he crossed the room gently to look at the sick man  and returning  said to me   he does not hear    what  dead   asked  startled   no  not yet   he answered  with great composure  then  alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station yard   when one has got to make correct entries  one comes to hate those savages  hate them to the death   he remained thoughtful for a moment   when you see mr  kurtz   he went on   tell him from me that everything here   he glanced at the desk   is very satisfactory  do not like to write to him  with those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter  at that central station   he stared at me for a moment with his mild  bulging eyes   oh  he will go far  very far   he began again   he will be a somebody in the administration before long  they  above  the council in europe  you know  mean him to be     he turned to his work  the noise outside had ceased  and presently in going out stopped at the door  in the steady buzz of flies the homeward bound agent was lying flushed and insensible  the other  bent over his books  was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions  and fifty feet below the doorstep could see the still tree tops of the grove of death    next day left that station at last  with a caravan of sixty men  for a two hundred mile tramp    no use telling you much about that  paths  paths  everywhere  a stamped in network of paths spreading over the empty land  through long grass  through burnt grass  through thickets  down and up chilly ravines  up and down stony hills ablaze with heat  and a solitude  a solitude  nobody  not a hut  the population had cleared out a long time ago  well  if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between deal and gravesend  catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them  fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon  only here the dwellings were gone too  still passed through several abandoned villages  there is something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls  day after day  with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me  each pair under a   lb  load  camp  cook  sleep  strike camp  march  now and then a carrier dead in harness  at rest in the long grass near the path  with an empty water gourd and his long staff lying by his side  a great silence around and above  perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far off drums  sinking  swelling  a tremor vast  faint  a sound weird  appealing  suggestive  and wild  and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells in a christian country  once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform  camping on the path with an armed escort of lank zanzibaris  very hospitable and festive  not to say drunk  was looking after the upkeep of the road  he declared  cannot say saw any road or any upkeep  unless the body of a middle aged negro  with a bullet hole in the forehead  upon which absolutely stumbled three miles farther on  may be considered as a permanent improvement  had a white companion too  not a bad chap  but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides  miles away from the least bit of shade and water  annoying  you know  to hold your own coat like a parasol over a man own head while he is coming to  could not help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all   to make money  of course  what do you think   he said  scornfully  then he got fever  and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole  as he weighed sixteen stone had no end of rows with the carriers  they jibbed  ran away  sneaked off with their loads in the night  quite a mutiny  so  one evening  made a speech in english with gestures  not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me  and the next morning started the hammock off in front all right  an hour afterwards came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush  man  hammock  groans  blankets  horrors  the heavy pole had skinned his poor nose  he was very anxious for me to kill somebody  but there was not the shadow of a carrier near  remembered the old doctor    it would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals  on the spot   felt was becoming scientifically interesting  however  all that is to no purpose  on the fifteenth day came in sight of the big river again  and hobbled into the central station  it was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest  with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side  and on the three others inclosed by a crazy fence of rushes  a neglected gap was all the gate it had  and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show  white men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings  strolling up to take a look at me  and then retired out of sight somewhere  one of them  a stout  excitable chap with black mustaches  informed me with great volubility and many digressions  as soon as told him who was  that my steamer was at the bottom of the river  was thunderstruck  what  how  why  oh  it was  right   the  manager himself  was there  all quite correct   everybody had behaved splendidly  splendidly     you must   he said in agitation   go and see the general manager at once  he is waiting     did not see the real significance of that wreck at once  fancy see it now  but am not sure  not at all  certainly the affair was too stupid  when think of it  to be altogether natural  still        but at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance  the steamer was sunk  they had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board  in charge of some volunteer skipper  and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones  and she sank near the south bank  asked myself what was to do there  now my boat was lost  as a matter of fact  had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river  had to set about it the very next day  that  and the repairs when brought the pieces to the station  took some months    my first interview with the manager was curious  he did not ask me to sit down after my twenty mile walk that morning  he was commonplace in complexion  in features  in manners  and in voice  he was of middle size and of ordinary build  his eyes  of the usual blue  were perhaps remarkably cold  and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an ax  but even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention  otherwise there was only an indefinable  faint expression of his lips  something stealthy  a smile  not a smile  remember it  but cannot explain  it was unconscious  this smile was  though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant  it came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable  he was a common trader  from his youth up employed in these parts  nothing more  he was obeyed  yet he inspired neither love nor fear  nor even respect  he inspired uneasiness  that was it  uneasiness  not a definite mistrust  just uneasiness  nothing more  you have no idea how effective such a       a       faculty can be  he had no genius for organizing  for initiative  or for order even  that was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station  he had no learning  and no intelligence  his position had come to him  why  perhaps because he was never ill       he had served three terms of three years out there       because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself  when he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale  pompously  jack ashore  with a difference  in externals only  this one could gather from his casual talk  he originated nothing  he could keep the routine going  that is all  but he was great  he was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man  he never gave that secret away  perhaps there was nothing within him  such a suspicion made one pause  for out there there were no external checks  once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every  agent  in the station  he was heard to say   men who come out here should have no entrails   he sealed the utterance with that smile of his  as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping  you fancied you had seen things  but the seal was on  when annoyed at meal times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence  he ordered an immense round table to be made  for which a special house had to be built  this was the station own mess room  where he sat was the first place  the rest were nowhere  one felt this to be his unalterable conviction  he was neither civil nor uncivil  he was quiet  he allowed his  boy   an overfed young negro from the coast  to treat the white men  under his very eyes  with provoking insolence    he began to speak as soon as he saw me  had been very long on the road  he could not wait  had to start without me  the up river stations had to be relieved  there had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive  and how they got on  and so on  and so on  he paid no attention to my explanations  and  playing with a stick of sealing wax  repeated several times that the situation was  very grave  very grave   there were rumors that a very important station was in jeopardy  and its chief  mr  kurtz  was ill  hoped it was not true  mr  kurtz was       felt weary and irritable  hang kurtz  thought  interrupted him by saying had heard of mr  kurtz on the coast   ah  so they talk of him down there   he murmured to himself  then he began again  assuring me mr  kurtz was the best agent he had  an exceptional man  of the greatest importance to the company  therefore could understand his anxiety  he was  he said   very  very uneasy   certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal  exclaimed   ah  mr  kurtz   broke the stick of sealing wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident  next thing he wanted to know  how long it would take to        interrupted him again  being hungry  you know  and kept on my feet too  was getting savage   how could tell   said   had not even seen the wreck yet  some months  no doubt   all this talk seemed to me so futile   ownome months   he said   well  let us say three months before we can make a start  yes  that ought to do the affair   flung out of his hut  he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda  muttering to myself my opinion of him  he was a chattering idiot  afterwards took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the  affair     went to work the next day  turning  so to speak  my back on that station  in that way only it seemed to me could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life  still  one must look about sometimes  and then saw this station  these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard  asked myself sometimes what it all meant  they wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands  like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence  the word  ivory  rang in the air  was whispered  was sighed  you would think they were praying to it  a taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all  like a whiff from some corpse  by jove  I have never seen anything so unreal in my life  and outside  the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible  like evil or truth  waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion    oh  these months  well  never mind  various things happened  one evening a grass she would full of calico  cotton prints  beads  and do not know what else  burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash  was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer  and saw them all cutting capers in the light  with their arms lifted high  when the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river  a tin pail in his hand  assured me that everybody was  behaving splendidly  splendidly   dipped about a quart of water and tore back again  noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail    strolled up  there was no hurry  you see the thing had gone off like a box of matches  it had been hopeless from the very first  the flame had leaped high  driven everybody back  lighted up everything  and collapsed  the she would was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely  a nigger was being beaten near by  they said he had caused the fire in some way  be that as it may  he was screeching most horribly  saw him  later on  for several days  sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself  afterwards he arose and went out  and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again  as approached the glow from the dark found myself at the back of two men  talking  heard the name of kurtz pronounced  then the words   take advantage of this unfortunate accident   one of the men was the manager  wished him a good evening   did you ever see anything like it  eh  it is incredible   he said  and walked off  the other man remained  he was a first class agent  young  gentlemanly  a bit reserved  with a forked little beard and a hooked nose  he was stand offish with the other agents  and they on their side said he was the manager own spy upon them  as to me  had hardly ever spoken to him before  we got into talk  and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins  then he asked me to his room  which was in the main building of the station  he struck a match  and perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver mounted dressing case but also a whole candle all to himself  just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles  native mats covered the clay walls  a collection of spears  assegais  shields  knives was hung up in trophies  the business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks  so had been informed  but there was not a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station  and he had been there more than a year  waiting  it seems he could not make bricks without something  do not know what  straw maybe  anyways  it could not be found there  and as it was not likely to be sent from europe  it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for  an act of special creation perhaps  however  they were all waiting  all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them  for something  and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation  from the way they took it  though the only thing that ever came to them was disease  as far as could see  they beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way  there was an air of plotting about that station  but nothing came of it  of course  it was as unreal as everything else  as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern  as their talk  as their government  as their show of work  the only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading post where ivory was to be had  so that they could earn percentages  they intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account   but as to effectually lifting a little finger  oh  no  by heavens  there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter  steal a horse straight out  very well  he has done it  perhaps he can ride  but there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick    had no idea why he wanted to be sociable  but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something  in fact  pumping me  he alluded constantly to europe  to the people was supposed to know there  putting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city  and so on  his little eyes glittered like mica discs  with curiosity   though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness  at first was astonished  but very soon became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me  could not possibly imagine what had in me to make it worth his while  it was very pretty to see how he baffled himself  for in truth my body was full of chills  and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business  it was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator  at last he got angry  and to conceal a movement of furious annoyance  he yawned  rose  then noticed a small sketch in oils  on a panel  representing a woman  draped and blindfolded  carrying a lighted torch  the background was somber  almost black  the movement of the woman was stately  and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister    it arrested me  and he stood by civilly  holding a half pint champagne bottle  medical comforts  with the candle stuck in it  to my question he said mr  kurtz had painted this  in this very station more than a year ago  while waiting for means to go to his trading post   tell me  pray   said i   who is this mr  kurtz      the chief of the inner station   he answered in a short tone  looking away   much obliged   said  laughing   and you are the brickmaker of the central station  everyone knows that   he was silent for a while   he is a prodigy   he said at last   he is an emissary of pity  and science  and progress  and devil knows what else  we want   he began to declaim suddenly   for the guidance of the because intrusted to us by europe  so to speak  higher intelligence  wide sympathies  a singleness of purpose    who says that   asked   lots of them   he replied   ownome even write that  and so  he  comes here  a special being  as you ought to know    why ought to know   interrupted  really surprised  he paid no attention   yes  to day he is chief of the best station  next year he will be assistant manager  two years more and       but dare say you know what he will be in two years  time  you are of the new gang  the gang of virtue  the same people who sent him specially also recommended you  oh  do not say no  I have my own eyes to trust   light dawned upon me  my dear aunt own influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man  nearly burst into a laugh   do you read the company own confidential correspondence   asked  he had not a word to say  it was great fun   when mr  kurtz   continued severely   is general manager  you will not have the opportunity     he blew the candle out suddenly  and we went outside  the moon had risen  black figures strolled about listlessly  pouring water on the glow  whence proceeded a sound of hissing  steam ascended in the moonlight  the beaten nigger groaned somewhere   what a row the brute makes   said the indefatigable man with the mustaches  appearing near us   ownerve him right  transgression  punishment  bang  pitiless  pitiless  that is the only way  this will prevent all conflagrations for the future  was just telling the manager        he noticed my companion  and became crestfallen all at once   not in bed yet   he said  with a kind of servile heartiness   it is so natural  ha  danger  agitation   he vanished  went on to the river side  and the other followed me  heard a scathing murmur at my ear   heap of muffs  go to   the pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating  discussing  several had still their staves in their hands  verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them  beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight  and through the dim stir  through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard  the silence of the land went home to one own very heart   its mystery  its greatness  the amazing reality of its concealed life  the hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by  and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there  felt a hand introducing itself under my arm   my dear sir   said the fellow   do not want to be misunderstood  and especially by you  who will see mr  kurtz long before can have that pleasure  would not like him to get a false idea of my disposition            let him run on  this  papier mache  mephistopheles  and it seemed to me that if tried could poke my forefinger through him  and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt  maybe  he  do not you see  had been planning to be assistant manager by and by under the present man  and could see that the coming of that kurtz had upset them both not a little  he talked precipitately  and did not try to stop him  had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer  hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal  the smell of mud  of primeval mud  by jove  was in my nostrils  the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes  there were shiny patches on the black creek  the moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver  over the rank grass  over the mud  upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple  over the great river could see through a somber gap glittering  glittering  as it flowed broadly by without a murmur  all this was great  expectant  mute  while the man jabbered about himself  wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace  what were we who had strayed in here  could we handle that dumb thing  or would it handle us  felt how big  how confoundedly big  was that thing that could not talk  and perhaps was deaf as well  what was in there  could see a little ivory coming out from there  and had heard mr  kurtz was in there  had heard enough about it too  god knows  yet somehow it did not bring any image with it  no more than if had been told an angel or a fiend was in there  believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet mars  knew once a scotch sailmaker who was certain  dead sure  there were people in mars  if you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved  he would get shy and mutter something about  walking on all fours   if you as much as smiled  he would  though a man of sixty  offer to fight you  would not have gone so far as to fight for kurtz  but went for him near enough to a lie  you know hate  detest  and cannot bear a lie  not because am straighter than the rest of us  but simply because it appalls me  there is a taint of death  a flavor of mortality in lies   which is exactly what hate and detest in the world  what want to forget  it makes me miserable and sick  like biting something rotten would do  temperament  suppose  well  went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in europe  became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims  this simply because had a notion it somehow would be of help to that kurtz whom at the time did not see  you understand  he was just a word for me  did not see the man in the name any more than you do  do you see him  do you see the story  do you see anything  it seems to me am trying to tell you a dream  making a vain attempt  because no relation of a dream can convey the dream sensation  that commingling of absurdity  surprise  and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt  that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams          he was silent for a while          no  it is impossible  it is impossible to convey the life sensation of any given epoch of one own existence   that which makes its truth  its meaning  its subtle and penetrating essence  it is impossible  we live  as we dream  alone          he paused again as if reflecting  then added   of course in this you fellows see more than could then  you see me  whom you know          it had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another  for a long time already he  sitting apart  had been no more to us than a voice  there was not a word from anybody  the others might have been asleep  but was awake  listened  listened on the watch for the sentence  for the word  that would give me the clew to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night air of the river          yes  let him run on   marlow began again   and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me  did  and there was nothing behind me  there was nothing but that wretched  old  mangled steamboat was leaning against  while he talked fluently about  the necessity for every man to get on    and when one comes out here  you conceive  it is not to gaze at the moon   mr  kurtz was a  universal genius   but even a genius would find it easier to work with  adequate tools  intelligent men   he did not make bricks  why  there was a physical impossibility in the way  as was well aware  and if he did secretarial work for the manager  it was because  no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors   did see it  saw it  what more did want  what really wanted was rivets  by heaven  rivets  to get on with the work  to stop the hole  rivets wanted  there were cases of them down at the coast  cases  piled up  burst  split  you kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station yard on the hillside  rivets had rolled into the grove of death  you could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down  and there was not one rivet to be found where it was wanted  we had plates that would do  but nothing to fasten them with  and every week the messenger  a lone negro  letter bag on shoulder and staff in hand  left our station for the coast  and several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods   ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it  glass beads value about a penny a quart  confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs  and no rivets  three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat    he was becoming confidential now  but fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last  for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither god nor devil  let alone any mere man  said could see that very well  but what wanted was a certain quantity of rivets  and rivets were what really mr  kurtz wanted  if he had only known it  now letters went to the coast every week         my dear sir   he cried   write from dictation   demanded rivets  there was a way  for an intelligent man  he changed his manner  became very cold  and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus  wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer  stuck to my salvage night and day  was not disturbed  there was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds  the pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him  some even had sat up of nights for him  all this energy was wasted  though   that animal has a charmed life   he said   but you can say this only of brutes in this country  no man  you apprehend me   no man here bears a charmed life   he stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew  and his mica eyes glittering without a wink  then  with a curt good night  he strode off  could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled  which made me feel more hopeful than had been for days  it was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend  the battered  twisted  ruined  tin pot steamboat  clambered on board  she rang under my feet like an empty huntley   palmer biscuit tin kicked along a gutter  she was nothing so solid in make  and rather less pretty in shape  but had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her  no influential friend would have served me better  she had given me a chance to come out a bit  to find out what could do  no  do not like work  had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done  do not like work  no man does  but like what is in the work   the chance to find yourself  your own reality  for yourself  not for others  what no other man can ever know  they can only see the mere show  and never can tell what it really means    was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft  on the deck  with his legs dangling over the mud  you see rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station  whom the other pilgrims naturally despised  on account of their imperfect manners  suppose  this was the foreman  a boiler maker by trade  a good worker  he was a lank  bony  yellow faced man  with big intense eyes  his aspect was worried  and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand  but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin  and had prospered in the new locality  for his beard hung down to his waist  he was a widower with six young children  he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there   and the passion of his life was pigeon flying  he was an enthusiast and a connoisseur  he would rave about pigeons  after work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons  at work  when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat  he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose  it had loops to go over his ears  in the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care  then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry    slapped him on the back and shouted   we shall have rivets   he scrambled to his feet exclaiming  no  rivets   as though he could not believe his ears  then in a low voice   you       eh   do not know why we behaved like lunatics  put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously   good for you   he cried  snapped his fingers above his head  lifting one foot  tried a jig  we capered on the iron deck  a frightful clatter came out of that hulk  and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station  it must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels  a dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager own hut  vanished  then  a second or so after  the doorway itself vanished too  we stopped  and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land  the great wall of vegetation  an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks  branches  leaves  boughs  festoons  motionless in the moonlight  was like a rioting invasion of soundless life  a rolling wave of plants  piled up  crested  ready to topple over the creek  to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence  and it moved not  a deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar  as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river   after all   said the boiler maker in a reasonable tone   why should not we get the rivets   why not  indeed  did not know of any reason why we should not   they will come in three weeks   said confidently    but they did not  instead of rivets there came an invasion  an infliction  a visitation  it came in sections during the next three weeks  each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes  bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims  a quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkeys  a lot of tents  camp stools  tin boxes  white cases  brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard  and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station  five such installments came  with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores  that  one would think  they were lugging  after a raid  into the wilderness for equitable division  it was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving    this devoted band called itself the eldorado exploring expedition  and believe they were sworn to secrecy  their talk  however  was the talk of sordid buccaneers  it was reckless without hardihood  greedy without audacity  and cruel without courage  there was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them  and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world  to tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire  with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe  who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise do not know  but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot    in exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighborhood  and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning  he carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs  and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew  you could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab    had given up worrying myself about the rivets  one own capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose  said hang   and let things slide  had plenty of time for meditation  and now and then would give some thought to kurtz  was not very interested in him  no  still  was curious to see whether this man  who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort  would climb to the top after all  and how he would set about his work when there

""One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard
voices approaching--and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling
along the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost
myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: 'I am as
harmless as a little child, but I don't like to be dictated to. Am I the
manager--or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It's incredible.'
. . . I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside
the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it
did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. 'It _is_ unpleasant,' grunted
the uncle. 'He has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the
other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed
accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not
frightful?' They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre
remarks: 'Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--by the
nose'--bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness,
so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle
said, 'The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone
there?' 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent his assistant down the
river with a note to me in these terms: ""Clear this poor devil out of
the country, and don't bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be
alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me."" It was more
than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!' 'Anything since
then?' asked the other, hoarsely. 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew; 'lots
of it--prime sort--lots--most annoying, from him.' 'And with that?'
questioned the heavy rumble. 'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to
speak. Then silence. They had been talking about Kurtz.

""I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained
still, having no inducement to change my position. 'How did that ivory
come all this way?' growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The
other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an
English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently
intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods
and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided
to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dug-out with four
paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the
ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such
a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed
to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dug-out,
four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly
on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home--perhaps; setting
his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and
desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply
a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you
understand, had not been pronounced once. He was 'that man.' The
half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult
trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that
scoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very
ill--had recovered imperfectly. . . . The two below me moved away then a
few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard:
'Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--quite alone now--unavoidable
delays--nine months--no news--strange rumors.' They approached again,
just as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know, unless a
species of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from
the natives.' Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in
snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and
of whom the manager did not approve. 'We will not be free from unfair
competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,'
he said. 'Certainly,' grunted the other; 'get him hanged! Why not?
Anything--anything can be done in this country. That's what I say;
nobody here, you understand, _here_, can endanger your position. And
why? You stand the climate--you outlast them all. The danger is in
Europe; but there before I left I took care to--' They moved off and
whispered, then their voices rose again. 'The extraordinary series of
delays is not my fault. I did my possible.' The fat man sighed, 'Very
sad.' 'And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other;
'he bothered me enough when he was here. ""Each station should be like a
beacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course,
but also for humanizing, improving, instructing."" Conceive you--that
ass! And he wants to be manager! No, it's--' Here he got choked by
excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was
surprised to see how near they were--right under me. I could have spat
upon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.
The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious
relative lifted his head. 'You have been well since you came out this
time?' he asked. The other gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a charm--like
a charm. But the rest--oh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick,
too, that I haven't the time to send them out of the country--it's
incredible!' 'H'm. Just so,' grunted the uncle. 'Ah! my boy, trust to
this--I say, trust to this.' I saw him extend his short flipper of
an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the
river,--seemed to beckon with a dishonoring flourish before the sunlit
face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the
hidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling
that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as
though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of
confidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The
high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience,
waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.

""They swore aloud together--out of sheer fright, I believe--then
pretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the
station. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed
to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal
length, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without
bending a single blade.

""In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness,
that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the
news came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate
of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found
what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at
the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say very soon I mean
it comparatively. It was just two months from the day we left the creek
when we came to the bank below Kurtz's station.

""Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings
of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were
kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air
was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of
sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into
the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sandbanks hippos and
alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed
through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you
would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to
find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for
ever from everything you had known once--somewhere--far away--in another
existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to one,
as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself;
but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered
with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of
plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in
the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force
brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful
aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no
time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by
inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I
was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I
shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the
life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to
keep a look-out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night
for next day's steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort,
to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality--the reality, I tell
you--fades. The inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily. But I felt it
all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at
my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your
respective tight-ropes for--what is it? half-a-crown a tumble--""

""Try to be civil, Marlow,"" growled a voice, and I knew there was at
least one listener awake besides myself.

""I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of
the price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well
done? You do your tricks very well. And I didn't do badly either, since
I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. It's a wonder to
me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road.
I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell
you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that's
supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.
No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the
very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and
think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend
to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to
wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.
We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine
fellows--cannibals--in their place. They were men one could work with,
and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other
before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat
which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three
or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came upon
a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and
the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of
joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the appearance
of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in
the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence, along empty
reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our
winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the
stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running
up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept
the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the
floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and
yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you
were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted
it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know.
To some place where they expected to get something, I bet! For me it
crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started
leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed
behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar
the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart
of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of
drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain
sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till
the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could
not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness;
the woodcutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig
would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an
earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied
ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance,
to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But
suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush
walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs,
a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes
rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer
toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.
The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who
could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings;
we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane
men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not
understand, because we were too far and could not remember, because we
were traveling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone,
leaving hardly a sign--and no memories.

""The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled
form of a conquered monster, but there--there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were
not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion of
their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled, and
leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just
the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote
kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly
enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that
there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible
frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it
which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend.
And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything
is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after
all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valor, rage--who can tell?--but
truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and
shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at
least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that
truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles?
Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would
fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An
appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit,
but I have a voice too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that
cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine
sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go
ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you
say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with
white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on
those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and
circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.
There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And
between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was
an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there
below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a
dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs.
A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted
at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of
intrepidity--and he had filed teeth too, the poor devil, and the wool of
his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each
of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping
his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to
strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because
he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should the water
in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler
would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible
vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully
(with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of
polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip),
while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left
behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept on, towards
Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow,
the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither
that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.

""Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds,
an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of
what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked
woodpile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of
firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing
on it. When deciphered it said: 'Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach
cautiously.' There was a signature, but it was illegible--not
Kurtz--a much longer word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the river? 'Approach
cautiously.' We had not done so. But the warning could not have been
meant for the place where it could be only found after approach.
Something was wrong above. But what--and how much? That was the
question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic
style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far,
either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and
flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could
see a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude
table--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner,
and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the
pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the
back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which
looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, 'An
Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a man Tower, Towson--some
such name--Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary
reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of
figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing
antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve
in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the
breaking strain of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not
a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a
singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going
to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,
luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor,
with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and
the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something
unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but
still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin, and plainly
referring to the text. I couldn't believe my eyes! They were in cipher!
Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that
description into this nowhere and studying it--and making notes--in
cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.

""I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I
lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by
all the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the river-side. I slipped the
book into my pocket. I assure you to leave off reading was like tearing
myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship.

""I started the lame engine ahead. 'It must be this miserable
trader--this intruder,' exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently
at the place we had left. 'He must be English,' I said. 'It will not
save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful,' muttered the
manager darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe
from trouble in this world.

""The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp,
the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on
tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the
wretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last
flickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a
tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but
I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long
on one thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed
a beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with
myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could
come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,
indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter
what anyone knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One
gets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair
lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of
meddling.

""Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight
miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked
grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it
would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we
were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning
to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in
daylight--not at dusk, or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight
miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us, and I could also see
suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was
annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since
one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had
plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle
of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a
railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had
set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on
the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every
living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone,
even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep--it
seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any
kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself
of being deaf--then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as
well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud
splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose
there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the
night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round
you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a
shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees,
of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun
hanging over it--all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came
down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the
chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it
stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of
infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A
complaining clamor, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The
sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know
how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had
screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did
this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried
outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short,
leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately
listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. 'Good God!
What is the meaning--?' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims,--a
little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore side-spring
boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained
open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush
out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at
'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we
were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of
dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around
her--and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our
eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off
without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.

""I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to
be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.
'Will they attack?' whispered an awed voice. 'We will all be butchered
in this fog,' murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the
hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious
to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black
fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the
river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The
whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of
being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an
alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially
quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the
chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle
the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested
black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils
and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me.
'Aha!' I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,
with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth--'catch
'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with
them?' 'Eat 'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,
looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude.
I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to
me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been
growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been
engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any
clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still
belonged to the beginnings of time--had no inherited experience to teach
them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper
written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the
river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live.
Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which
couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in
the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it
overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really
a case of legitimate self-defense. You can't breathe dead hippo waking,
sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on
existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of
brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to
buy their provisions with that currency in river-side villages. You can
see how _that_ worked. There were either no villages, or the people were
hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with
an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for
some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire
itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what
good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid
with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company. For
the rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eatable in the
least--I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like
half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender color, they kept wrapped in
leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it
seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose
of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they
didn't go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good tuck in for
once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men,
with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with
strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their
muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of
those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there.
I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest--not because it
occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I
own to you that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--how
unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped,
that my aspect was not so--what shall I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch
of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that
pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever too. One
can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had
often 'a little fever,' or a little touch of other things--the playful
paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more
serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you
would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives,
capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable
physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it
superstition, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive honor?
No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust
simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs,
and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.
Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating
torment, its black thoughts, its somber and brooding ferocity? Well,
I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.
It's really easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition of
one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these
chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I
would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst
the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me--the fact
dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a
ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought
of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this
savage clamor that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind
whiteness of the fog.

""Two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers as to which bank.
'Left.' 'No, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.' 'It is very
serious,' said the manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if
anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.' I looked at him,
and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of
man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But
when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take
the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.
Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in
the air--in space. We wouldn't be able to tell where we were going
to--whether up or down stream, or across--till we fetched against one
bank or the other,--and then we wouldn't know at first which it was.
Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn't
imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether drowned at once or
not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. 'I authorize
you to take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence. 'I refuse to
take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer he expected, though
its tone might have surprised him. 'Well, I must defer to your judgment.
You are captain,' he said, with marked civility. I turned my shoulder to
him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog. How long would
it last? It was the most hopeless look-out. The approach to this Kurtz
grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as
though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle.
'Will they attack, do you think?' asked the manager, in a confidential
tone.

""I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The
thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get
lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also
judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes were
in it, eyes that had seen us. The river-side bushes were certainly very
thick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable.
However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the
reach--certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of
attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise--of the cries we
had heard. They had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile
intention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had
given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the
steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained
grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a
great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent
itself in violence--but more generally takes the form of apathy. . . .

""You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or
even to revile me; but I believe they thought me gone mad--with fright,
maybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good
bothering. Keep a look-out? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for
the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else our
eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep
in a heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it too--choking, warm, stifling.
Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely
true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an
attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive--it
was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the
stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.

""It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and
its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a
half below Kurtz's station. We had just floundered and flopped round a
bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in
the middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we
opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sandbank,
or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of
the river. They were discolored, just awash, and the whole lot was seen
just under the water, exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down
the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could
go to the right or to the left of this. I didn't know either channel, of
course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same;
but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally
headed for the western passage.

""No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much
narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long
uninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily
overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.
The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a
large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then
well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a
broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow
we steamed up--very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well
inshore--the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole
informed me.

""One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just
below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck
there were two little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows. The
boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over the
whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel
projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin
built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch,
two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny
table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad
shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I
spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,
before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An
athletic black belonging to some coast tribe, and educated by my poor
predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore
a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the
world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.
He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost
sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would
let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.

""I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to
see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw
my poleman give up the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on
the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept
hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the
fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his
furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the
river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks,
little sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my
nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All
this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly
quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel
and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by
Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter
on the land side. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was
lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a
reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of
the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw
a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very
fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed
from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,
arms, legs, glaring eyes,--the bush was swarming with human limbs in
movement, glistening, of bronze color. The twigs shook, swayed, and
rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.
'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid,
face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down
his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep quiet!' I said in a
fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.
I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron
deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?'
I caught shape of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another
snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with
their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A
deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at
it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the
doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been
poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat. The bush
began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a
rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the
pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the
wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter
open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening,
glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the
sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I
had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded
smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the
bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.

""We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs
and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen
it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting
whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out
at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty
rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent
double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something
big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,
and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an
extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The
side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared
a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It
looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had
lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were
clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred
yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my
feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had
rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched
that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged
through the opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the
blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes
were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the
wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing luster. The fusillade burst out
again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something
precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from
him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend
to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of
the steam-whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The
tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from
the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of
mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight
of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the
bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out
sharply--then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came
plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when
the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the
doorway. 'The manager sends me--' he began in an official tone, and
stopped short. 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the wounded man.

""We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance
enveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put
to us some question in an understandable language; but he died without
uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle.
Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we
could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily,
and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably somber,
brooding, and menacing expression. The luster of inquiring glance faded
swiftly into vacant glassiness. 'Can you steer?' I asked the agent
eagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he
understood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you
the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. 'He is
dead,' murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. 'No doubt about it,'
said I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. 'And, by the way, I suppose
Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.'

""For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of
extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving
after something altogether without a substance. I couldn't have been
more disgusted if I had traveled all this way for the sole purpose of
talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with. . . . I flung one shoe overboard,
and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward
to--a talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never
imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn't say to
myself, 'Now I will never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by
the hand,' but, 'Now I will never hear him.' The man presented himself
as a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of
action. Hadn't I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration
that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all
the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his
being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood
out pre-eminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was
his ability to talk, his words--the gift of expression, the bewildering,
the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the
pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an
impenetrable darkness.

""The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I thought,
'By Jove! it's all over. We are too late; he has vanished--the gift has
vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that
chap speak after all,'--and my sorrow had a startling extravagance
of emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these
savages in the bush. I couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation
somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in
life. . . . Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well,
absurd. Good Lord! mustn't a man ever--Here, give me some tobacco."" . . .

There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and
Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and
dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he
took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of
the night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame. The match went out.

""Absurd!"" he cried. ""This is the worst of trying to tell. . . . Here
you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with
two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another,
excellent appetites, and temperature normal--you hear--normal from
year's end to year's end. And you say, Absurd! Absurd be--exploded!
Absurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer
nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes. Now I think of
it, it is amazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud
of my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the
inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I
was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh yes, I heard more than
enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a
voice. And I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them were
so little more than voices--and the memory of that time itself lingers
around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber,
silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of
sense. Voices, voices--even the girl herself--now--""

He was silent for a long time.

""I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,"" he began suddenly.
""Girl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it--completely.
They--the women, I mean--are out of it--should be out of it. We must
help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours
gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the
disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.' You would have
perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty
frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,
but this--ah specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted
him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball--an ivory ball; it had
caressed him, and--lo!--he had withered; it had taken him, loved him,
embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed
his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish
initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favorite. Ivory? I should
think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting
with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above
or below the ground in the whole country. 'Mostly fossil,' the manager
had remarked disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they
call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury
the tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn't bury this parcel
deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the
steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could
see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this
favor had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say,
'My ivory.' Oh yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my
river, my--' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in
expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of
laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything
belonged to him--but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he
belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That
was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible--it
was not good for one either--trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat
amongst the devils of the land--I mean literally. You can't understand.
How could you?--with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind
neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately
between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and
gallows and lunatic asylums--how can you imagine what particular region
of the first ages a man's untrammeled feet may take him into by the way
of solitude--utter solitude without a policeman--by the way of silence,
utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard
whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the great
difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate
strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may
be too much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you are being
assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a
bargain for his soul with the devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or
the devil too much of a devil--I don't know which. Or you may be such
a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to
anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only
a standing place--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain
I won't pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other.
The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with
sights, with sounds, with smells too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo,
so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don't you see?
Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of
unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--your power of devotion,
not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that's
difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain--I am
trying to account to myself for--for--Mr. Kurtz--for the shade of Mr.
Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honored me with
its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because
it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated
partly in England, and--as he was good enough to say himself--his
sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his
father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz;
and by-and-by I learned that, most appropriately, the International
Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the
making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it too.
I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence,
but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had
found time for! But this must have been before his--let us say--nerves,
went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending
with unspeakable rites, which--as far as I reluctantly gathered
from what I heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you
understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece
of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later
information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument
that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must
necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural
beings--we approach them with the might as of a deity,' and so on, and
so on. 'By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good
practically unbounded,' &c., &c. From that point he soared and took me
with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember,
you know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an
august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the
unbounded power of eloquence--of words--of burning noble words. There
were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,
unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently
much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of
a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to
every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying,
like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!'
The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that
valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to
himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet'
(he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence
upon his career. I had full information about all these things, and,
besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I've
done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I
choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst
all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of
civilization. But then, you see, I can't choose. He won't be forgotten.
Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or
frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his
honor; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter
misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered
one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with
self-seeking. No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm
the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I
missed my late helmsman awfully,--I missed him even while his body
was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing
strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of
sand in a black Sahara. Well, don't you see, he had done something, he
had steered; for months I had him at my back--a help--an instrument. It
was a kind of partnership. He steered for me--I had to look after him, I
worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,
of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the
intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt
remains to this day in my memory--like a claim of distant kinship
affirmed in a supreme moment.

""Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint,
no restraint--just like Kurtz--a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as
I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first
jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed
with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little
door-step; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from
behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on
earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.
The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I
saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the
pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck
about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited
magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.
What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can't guess.
Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous,
murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise
scandalized, and with a better show of reason--though I admit that the
reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind
that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have
him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was
dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause
some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the
man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

""This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going
half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened
to the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the
station; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and so on--and
so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that
at least this poor Kurtz had been properly revenged. 'Say! We must have
made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think?
Say?' He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.
And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help
saying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.' I had seen, from the
way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots
had gone too high. You can't hit anything unless you take aim and fire
from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes
shut. The retreat, I maintained--and I was right--was caused by the
screeching of the steam-whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began
to howl at me with indignant protests.

""The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the
necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events,
when I saw in the distance a clearing on the river-side and the outlines
of some sort of building. 'What's this?' I asked. He clapped his hands
in wonder. 'The station!' he cried. I edged in at once, still going
half-speed.

""Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare
trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on
the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the
peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a
background. There was no inclosure or fence of any kind; but there had
been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained
in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with
round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had
disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank
was clear, and on the water-side I saw a white man under a hat like a
cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the
edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see
movements--human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently,
then stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore
began to shout, urging us to land. 'We have been attacked,' screamed
the manager. 'I know--I know. It's all right,' yelled back the other, as
cheerful as you please. 'Come along. It's all right. I am glad.'

""His aspect reminded me of something I had seen--something funny I had
seen somewhere. As I maneuvered to get alongside, I was asking myself,
'What does this fellow look like?' Suddenly I got it. He looked like
a harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown
holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright
patches, blue, red, and yellow,--patches on the back, patches on front,
patches on elbows, on knees; colored binding round his jacket, scarlet
edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him look
extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see how
beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish face,
very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes,
smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like
sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain. 'Look out, captain!' he
cried; 'there's a snag lodged in here last night.' What! Another snag? I
confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off
that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose
up to me. 'You English?' he asked, all smiles. 'Are you?' I shouted from
the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for
my disappointment. Then he brightened up. 'Never mind!' he cried
encouragingly. 'Are we in time?' I asked. 'He is up there,' he replied,
with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a
sudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright
the next.

""When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the
teeth, had gone to the house, this chap came on board. 'I say, I
don't like this. These natives are in the bush,' I said. He assured me
earnestly it was all right. 'They are simple people,' he added; 'well,
I am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.' 'But you
said it was all right,' I cried. 'Oh, they meant no harm,' he said; and
as I stared he corrected himself, 'Not exactly.' Then vivaciously, 'My
faith, your pilot-house wants a clean up!' In the next breath he advised
me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any
trouble. 'One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.
They are simple people,' he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate
he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of
silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. 'Don't
you talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said. 'You don't talk with that man--you
listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe exaltation. 'But now--' He
waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost
depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a jump,
possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he
gabbled: 'Brother sailor . . . honor . . . pleasure . . . delight . . .
introduce myself . . . Russian . . . son of an arch-priest . . .
Government of Tambov . . . What? Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent
English tobacco! Now, that's brotherly. Smoke? Where's a sailor that
does not smoke?'

""The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from
school, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some
time in English ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made
a point of that. 'But when one is young one must see things, gather
experience, ideas; enlarge the mind.' 'Here!' I interrupted. 'You can
never tell! Here I have met Mr. Kurtz,' he said, youthfully solemn and
reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a
Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods,
and had started for the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of
what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that
river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything.
'I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five,' he said. 'At first old
Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,' he narrated with keen
enjoyment; 'but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he
got afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favorite dog, so he gave
me some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never
see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten. I've sent him one
small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can't call me a little thief
when I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I don't care. I had
some wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you see?'

""I gave him Towson's book. He made as though he would kiss me, but
restrained himself. 'The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost
it,' he said, looking at it ecstatically. 'So many accidents happen to
a man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes--and
sometimes you've got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.'
He thumbed the pages. 'You made notes in Russian?' I asked. He nodded.
'I thought they were written in cipher,' I said. He laughed, then became
serious. 'I had lots of trouble to keep these people off,' he said. 'Did
they want to kill you?' I asked. 'Oh no!' he cried, and checked
himself. 'Why did they attack us?' I pursued. He hesitated, then
said shamefacedly, 'They don't want him to go.' 'Don't they?' I said,
curiously. He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. 'I tell you,' he
cried, 'this man has enlarged my mind.' He opened his arms wide, staring
at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round.""

",   one evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat  i heard voices approaching  and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank  i laid my head on my arm again  and had nearly lost myself in a doze  when somebody said in my ear  as it were   i am as harmless as a little child  but i do not like to be dictated to  am i the manager  or am i not  i was ordered to send him there  it is incredible         i became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat  just below my head  i did not move  it did not occur to me to move  i was sleepy   it  is  unpleasant   grunted the uncle   he has asked the administration to be sent there   said the other   with the idea of showing what he could do  and i was instructed accordingly  look at the influence that man must have  is it not frightful   they both agreed it was frightful  then made several bizarre remarks   make rain and fine weather  one man  the council  by the nose   bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness  so that i had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said   the climate may do away with this difficulty for you  is he alone there    yes   answered the manager   he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms   clear this poor devil out of the country  and do not bother sending more of that sort  i had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me   it was more than a year ago  can you imagine such impudence    anything since then   asked the other  hoarsely   ivory   jerked the nephew   lots of it  prime sort  lots  most annoying  from him    and with that   questioned the heavy rumble   invoice   was the reply fired out  so to speak  then silence  they had been talking about kurtz    i was broad awake by this time  but  lying perfectly at ease  remained still  having no inducement to change my position   how did that ivory come all this way   growled the elder man  who seemed very vexed  the other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an english half caste clerk kurtz had with him  that kurtz had apparently intended to return himself  the station being by that time bare of goods and stores  but after coming three hundred miles  had suddenly decided to go back  which he started to do alone in a small dug out with four paddlers  leaving the half caste to continue down the river with the ivory  the two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing  they were at a loss for an adequate motive  as to me  i seemed to see kurtz for the first time  it was a distinct glimpse  the dug out  four paddling savages  and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters  on relief  on thoughts of home  perhaps  setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness  towards his empty and desolate station  i did not know the motive  perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake  his name  you understand  had not been pronounced once  he was  that man   the half caste  who  as far as i could see  had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck  was invariably alluded to as  that scoundrel   the  owncoundrel  had reported that the  man  had been very ill  had recovered imperfectly        the two below me moved away then a few paces  and strolled back and forth at some little distance  i heard   military post  doctor  two hundred miles  quite alone now  unavoidable delays  nine months  no news  strange rumors   they approached again  just as the manager was saying   no one  as far as i know  unless a species of wandering trader  a pestilential fellow  snapping ivory from the natives   who was it they were talking about now  i gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in kurtz own district  and of whom the manager did not approve   we will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example   he said   certainly   grunted the other   get him hanged  why not  anything  anything can be done in this country  that is what i say  nobody here  you understand   here   can endanger your position  and why  you stand the climate  you outlast them all  the danger is in europe  but there before i left i took care to    they moved off and whispered  then their voices rose again   the extraordinary series of delays is not my fault  i did my possible   the fat man sighed   very sad    and the pestiferous absurdity of his talk   continued the other   he bothered me enough when he was here   each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things  a center for trade of course  but also for humanizing  improving  instructing   conceive you  that ass  and he wants to be manager  no  it is    here he got choked by excessive indignation  and i lifted my head the least bit  i was surprised to see how near they were  right under me  i could have spat upon their hats  they were looking on the ground  absorbed in thought  the manager was switching his leg with a slender twig  his sagacious relative lifted his head   you have been well since you came out this time   he asked  the other gave a start   who  i  oh  like a charm  like a charm  but the rest  oh  my goodness  all sick  they die so quick  too  that i have not the time to send them out of the country  it is incredible    h m  just so   grunted the uncle   ah  my boy  trust to this  i say  trust to this   i saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest  the creek  the mud  the river   seemed to beckon with a dishonoring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death  to the hidden evil  to the profound darkness of its heart  it was so startling that i leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest  as though i had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence  you know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes  the high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience  waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion    they swore aloud together  out of sheer fright  i believe  then pretending not to know anything of my existence  turned back to the station  the sun was low  and leaning forward side by side  they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length  that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade    in a few days the eldorado expedition went into the patient wilderness  that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver  long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead  i know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals  they  no doubt  like the rest of us  found what they deserved  i did not inquire  i was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting kurtz very soon  when i say very soon i mean it comparatively  it was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below kurtz own station    going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world  when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings  an empty stream  a great silence  an impenetrable forest  the air was warm  thick  heavy  sluggish  there was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine  the long stretches of the waterway ran on  deserted  into the gloom of overshadowed distances  on silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side  the broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands  you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert  and butted all day long against shoals  trying to find the channel  till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once  somewhere  far away  in another existence perhaps  there were moments when one own past came back to one  as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself  but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream  remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants  and water  and silence  and this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace  it was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention  it looked at you with a vengeful aspect  i got used to it afterwards  i did not see it any more  i had no time  i had to keep guessing at the channel  i had to discern  mostly by inspiration  the signs of hidden banks  i watched for sunken stones  i was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out  when i shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims  i had to keep a look out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day own steaming  when you have to attend to things of that sort  to the mere incidents of the surface  the reality  the reality  i tell you  fades  the inner truth is hidden  luckily  luckily  but i felt it all the same  i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks  just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight ropes for  what is it  half a crown a tumble      try to be civil  marlow   growled a voice  and i knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself    i beg your pardon  i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price  and indeed what does the price matter  if the trick be well done  you do your tricks very well  and i did not do badly either  since i managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip  it is a wonder to me yet  imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road  i sweated and shivered over that business considerably  i can tell you  after all  for a seaman  to scrape the bottom of the thing that is supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin  no one may know of it  but you never forget the thump  eh  a blow on the very heart  you remember it  you dream of it  you wake up at night and think of it  years after  and go hot and cold all over  i do not pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time  more than once she had to wade for a bit  with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing  we had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew  fine fellows  cannibals  in their place  they were men one could work with  and i am grateful to them  and  after all  they did not eat each other before my face  they had brought along a provision of hippo meat which went rotten  and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils  phoo  i can sniff it now  i had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves  all complete  sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank  clinging to the skirts of the unknown  and the white men rushing out of a tumble down hovel  with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome  seemed very strange   had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell  the word ivory would ring in the air for a while  and on we went again into the silence  along empty reaches  round the still bends  between the high walls of our winding way  reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern wheel  trees  trees  millions of trees  massive  immense  running up high  and at their foot  hugging the bank against the stream  crept the little begrimed steamboat  like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico  it made you feel very small  very lost  and yet it was not altogether depressing  that feeling  after all  if you were small  the grimy beetle crawled on  which was just what you wanted it to do  where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to i do not know  to some place where they expected to get something  i bet  for me it crawled toward kurtz  exclusively  but when the steam pipes started leaking we crawled very slow  the reaches opened before us and closed behind  as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return  we penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness  it was very quiet there  at night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly  as if hovering in the air high over our heads  till the first break of day  whether it meant war  peace  or prayer we could not tell  the dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness  the woodcutters slept  their fires burned low  the snapping of a twig would make you start  we were wanderers on a prehistoric earth  on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet  we could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance  to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil  but suddenly  as we struggled round a bend  there would be a glimpse of rush walls  of peaked grass roofs  a burst of yells  a whirl of black limbs  a mass of hands clapping  of feet stamping  of bodies swaying  of eyes rolling  under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage  the steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy  the prehistoric man was cursing us  praying to us  welcoming us  who could tell  we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings  we glided past like phantoms  wondering and secretly appalled  as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse  we could not understand  because we were too far and could not remember  because we were traveling in the night of first ages  of those ages that are gone  leaving hardly a sign  and no memories    the earth seemed unearthly  we are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster  but there  there you could look at a thing monstrous and free  it was unearthly  and the men were  no  they were not inhuman  well  you know  that was the worst of it  this suspicion of their not being inhuman  it would come slowly to one  they howled  and leaped  and spun  and made horrid faces  but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity  like yours  the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar  ugly  yes  it was ugly enough  but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise  a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you  you so remote from the night of first ages  could comprehend  and why not  the mind of man is capable of anything  because everything is in it  all the past as well as all the future  what was there after all  joy  fear  sorrow  devotion  valor  rage  who can tell   but truth  truth stripped of its cloak of time  let the fool gape and shudder  the man knows  and can look on without a wink  but he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore  he must meet that truth with his own true stuff  with his own inborn strength  principles  principles will not do  acquisitions  clothes  pretty rags  rags that would fly off at the first good shake  no  you want a deliberate belief  an appeal to me in this fiendish row  is there  very well  i hear  i admit  but i have a voice too  and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced  of course  a fool  what with sheer fright and fine sentiments  is always safe  who is that grunting  you wonder i did not go ashore for a howl and a dance  well  no  i did not  fine sentiments  you say  fine sentiments  be hanged  i had no time  i had to mess about with white lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam pipes  i tell you  i had to watch the steering  and circumvent those snags  and get the tin pot along by hook or by crook  there was surface truth enough in these things to save a wiser man  and between whiles i had to look after the savage who was fireman  he was an improved specimen  he could fire up a vertical boiler  he was there below me  and  upon my word  to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat  walking on his hind legs  a few months of training had done for that really fine chap  he squinted at the steam gauge and at the water gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity  and he had filed teeth too  the poor devil  and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns  and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks  he ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank  instead of which he was hard at work  a thrall to strange witchcraft  full of improving knowledge  he was useful because he had been instructed  and what he knew was this  that should the water in that transparent thing disappear  the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst  and take a terrible vengeance  so he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully  with an impromptu charm  made of rags  tied to his arm  and a piece of polished bone  as big as a watch  stuck flatways through his lower lip   while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly  the short noise was left behind  the interminable miles of silence  and we crept on  towards kurtz  but the snags were thick  the water was treacherous and shallow  the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it  and thus neither that fireman nor i had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts    some fifty miles below the inner station we came upon a hut of reeds  an inclined and melancholy pole  with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it  and a neatly stacked woodpile  this was unexpected  we came to the bank  and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil writing on it  when deciphered it said   wood for you  hurry up  approach cautiously   there was a signature  but it was illegible  not kurtz  a much longer word   hurry up   where  up the river   approach cautiously   we had not done so  but the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach  something was wrong above  but what  and how much  that was the question  we commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style  the bush around said nothing  and would not let us look very far  either  a torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut  and flapped sadly in our faces  the dwelling was dismantled  but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago  there remained a rude table  a plank on two posts  a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner  and by the door i picked up a book  it had lost its covers  and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness  but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread  which looked clean yet  it was an extraordinary find  its title was   an inquiry into some points of seamanship   by a man tower  towson  some such name  master in his majesty own navy  the matter looked dreary reading enough  with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures  and the copy was sixty years old  i handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness  lest it should dissolve in my hands  within  towson or towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships  chains and tackle  and other such matters  not a very enthralling book  but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention  an honest concern for the right way of going to work  which made these humble pages  thought out so many years ago  luminous with another than a professional light  the simple old sailor  with his talk of chains and purchases  made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real  such a book being there was wonderful enough  but still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin  and plainly referring to the text  i could not believe my eyes  they were in cipher  yes  it looked like cipher  fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying it  and making notes  in cipher at that  it was an extravagant mystery    i had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise  and when i lifted my eyes i saw the wood pile was gone  and the manager  aided by all the pilgrims  was shouting at me from the river side  i slipped the book into my pocket  i assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship    i started the lame engine ahead   it must be this miserable trader  this intruder   exclaimed the manager  looking back malevolently at the place we had left   he must be english   i said   it will not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful   muttered the manager darkly  i observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world    the current was more rapid now  the steamer seemed at her last gasp  the stern wheel flopped languidly  and i caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat  for in sober truth i expected the wretched thing to give up every moment  it was like watching the last flickers of a life  but still we crawled  sometimes i would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards kurtz by  but i lost it invariably before we got abreast  to keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience  the manager displayed a beautiful resignation  i fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no i would talk openly with kurtz  but before i could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence  indeed any action of mine  would be a mere futility  what did it matter what anyone knew or ignored  what did it matter who was manager  one gets sometimes such a flash of insight  the essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface  beyond my reach  and beyond my power of meddling    towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from kurtz own station  i wanted to push on  but the manager looked grave  and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable  the sun being very low already  to wait where we were till next morning  moreover  he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed  we must approach in daylight  not at dusk  or in the dark  this was sensible enough  eight miles meant nearly three hours  steaming for us  and i could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach  nevertheless  i was annoyed beyond expression at the delay  and most unreasonably too  since one night more could not matter much after so many months  as we had plenty of wood  and caution was the word  i brought up in the middle of the stream  the reach was narrow  straight  with high sides like a railway cutting  the dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set  the current ran smooth and swift  but a dumb immobility sat on the banks  the living trees  lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth  might have been changed into stone  even to the slenderest twig  to the lightest leaf  it was not sleep  it seemed unnatural  like a state of trance  not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard  you looked on amazed  and began to suspect yourself of being deaf  then the night came suddenly  and struck you blind as well  about three in the morning some large fish leaped  and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired  when the sun rose there was a white fog  very warm and clammy  and more blinding than the night  it did not shift or drive  it was just there  standing all round you like something solid  at eight or nine  perhaps  it lifted as a shutter lifts  we had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees  of the immense matted jungle  with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it  all perfectly still  and then the white shutter came down again  smoothly  as if sliding in greased grooves  i ordered the chain  which we had begun to heave in  to be paid out again  before it stopped running with a muffled rattle  a cry  a very loud cry  as of infinite desolation  soared slowly in the opaque air  it ceased  a complaining clamor  modulated in savage discords  filled our ears  the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap  i do not know how it struck the others  to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed  so suddenly  and apparently from all sides at once  did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise  it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking  which stopped short  leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes  and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence   good god  what is the meaning     stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims   a little fat man  with sandy hair and red whiskers  who wore side spring boots  and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks  two others remained open mouthed a whole minute  then dashed into the little cabin  to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances  with winchesters at  ready  in their hands  what we could see was just the steamer we were on  her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving  and a misty strip of water  perhaps two feet broad  around her  and that was all  the rest of the world was nowhere  as far as our eyes and ears were concerned  just nowhere  gone  disappeared  swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind    i went forward  and ordered the chain to be hauled in short  so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary   will they attack   whispered an awed voice   we will all be butchered in this fog   murmured another  the faces twitched with the strain  the hands trembled slightly  the eyes forgot to wink  it was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew  who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we  though their homes were only eight hundred miles away  the whites  of course greatly discomposed  had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row  the others had an alert  naturally interested expression  but their faces were essentially quiet  even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain  several exchanged short  grunting phrases  which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction  their headman  a young  broad chested black  severely draped in dark blue fringed cloths  with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets  stood near me   aha   i said  just for good fellowship own sake   catch  I am   he snapped  with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth   catch  I am  give  I am to us    to you  eh   i asked   what would you do with them    eat  I am   he said curtly  and  leaning his elbow on the rail  looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude  i would no doubt have been properly horrified  had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry  that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past  they had been engaged for six months  i do not think a single one of them had any clear idea of time  as we at the end of countless ages have  they still belonged to the beginnings of time  had no inherited experience to teach them as it were   and of course  as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river  it did not enter anybody own head to trouble how they would live  certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo meat  which could not have lasted very long  anyway  even if the pilgrims had not  in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo  thrown a considerable quantity of it overboard  it looked like a high handed proceeding  but it was really a case of legitimate self defense  you cannot breathe dead hippo waking  sleeping  and eating  and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence  besides that  they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire  each about nine inches long  and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in river side villages  you can see how  that  worked  there were either no villages  or the people were hostile  or the director  who like the rest of us fed out of tins  with an occasional old he goat thrown in  did not want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason  so  unless they swallowed the wire itself  or made loops of it to snare the fishes with  i do not see what good their extravagant salary could be to them  i must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company  for the rest  the only thing to eat  though it did not look eatable in the least  i saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half cooked dough  of a dirty lavender color  they kept wrapped in leaves  and now and then swallowed a piece of  but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance  why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they did not go for us  they were thirty to five  and have a good tuck in for once  amazes me now when i think of it  they were big powerful men  with not much capacity to weigh the consequences  with courage  with strength  even yet  though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard  and i saw that something restraining  one of those human secrets that baffle probability  had come into play there  i looked at them with a swift quickening of interest  not because it occurred to me i might be eaten by them before very long  though i own to you that just then i perceived  in a new light  as it were  how unwholesome the pilgrims looked  and i hoped  yes  i positively hoped  that my aspect was not so  what shall i say   so  unappetizing  a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream sensation that pervaded all my days at that time  perhaps i had a little fever too  one cannot live with one own finger everlastingly on one own pulse  i had often  a little fever   or a little touch of other things  the playful paw strokes of the wilderness  the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course  yes  i looked at them as you would on any human being  with a curiosity of their impulses  motives  capacities  weaknesses  when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity  restraint  what possible restraint  was it superstition  disgust  patience  fear  or some kind of primitive honor  no fear can stand up to hunger  no patience can wear it out  disgust simply does not exist where hunger is  and as to superstition  beliefs  and what you may call principles  they are less than chaff in a breeze  do not you know the devilry of lingering starvation  its exasperating torment  its black thoughts  its somber and brooding ferocity  well  i do  it takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly  it is really easier to face bereavement  dishonor  and the perdition of one own soul  than this kind of prolonged hunger  sad  but true  and these chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple  restraint  i would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield  but there was the fact facing me  the fact dazzling  to be seen  like the foam on the depths of the sea  like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma  a mystery greater  when i thought of it  than the curious  inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamor that had swept by us on the river bank  behind the blind whiteness of the fog    two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers as to which bank   left    no  no  how can you  right  right  of course    it is very serious   said the manager own voice behind me   i would be desolated if anything should happen to mr  kurtz before we came up   i looked at him  and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere  he was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances  that was his restraint  but when he muttered something about going on at once  i did not even take the trouble to answer him  i knew  and he knew  that it was impossible  were we to let go our hold of the bottom  we would be absolutely in the air  in space  we would not be able to tell where we were going to  whether up or down stream  or across  till we fetched against one bank or the other   and then we would not know at first which it was  of course i made no move  i had no mind for a smash up  you could not imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck  whether drowned at once or not  we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another   i authorize you to take all the risks   he said  after a short silence   i refuse to take any   i said shortly  which was just the answer he expected  though its tone might have surprised him   well  i must defer to your judgment  you are captain   he said  with marked civility  i turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation  and looked into the fog  how long would it last  it was the most hopeless look out  the approach to this kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle   will they attack  do you think   asked the manager  in a confidential tone    i did not think they would attack  for several obvious reasons  the thick fog was one  if they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it  as we would be if we attempted to move  still  i had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable  and yet eyes were in it  eyes that had seen us  the river side bushes were certainly very thick  but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable  however  during the short lift i had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach  certainly not abreast of the steamer  but what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise  of the cries we had heard  they had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile intention  unexpected  wild  and violent as they had been  they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow  the glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief  the danger  if any  i expounded  was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose  even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence  but more generally takes the form of apathy          you should have seen the pilgrims stare  they had no heart to grin  or even to revile me  but i believe they thought me gone mad  with fright  maybe  i delivered a regular lecture  my dear boys  it was no good bothering  keep a look out  well  you may guess i watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse  but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton wool  it felt like it too  choking  warm  stifling  besides  all i said  though it sounded extravagant  was absolutely true to fact  what we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse  the action was very far from being aggressive  it was not even defensive  in the usual sense  it was undertaken under the stress of desperation  and in its essence was purely protective    it developed itself  i should say  two hours after the fog lifted  and its commencement was at a spot  roughly speaking  about a mile and a half below kurtz own station  we had just floundered and flopped round a bend  when i saw an islet  a mere grassy hummock of bright green  in the middle of the stream  it was the only thing of the kind  but as we opened the reach more  i perceived it was the head of a long sandbank  or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river  they were discolored  just awash  and the whole lot was seen just under the water  exactly as a man own backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin  now  as far as i did see  i could go to the right or to the left of this  i did not know either channel  of course  the banks looked pretty well alike  the depth appeared the same  but as i had been informed the station was on the west side  i naturally headed for the western passage    no sooner had we fairly entered it than i became aware it was much narrower than i had supposed  to the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal  and to the right a high  steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes  above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks  the twigs overhung the current thickly  and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream  it was then well on in the afternoon  the face of the forest was gloomy  and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water  in this shadow we steamed up  very slowly  as you may imagine  i sheered her well inshore  the water being deepest near the bank  as the sounding pole informed me    one of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me  this steamboat was exactly like a decked scow  on the deck there were two little teak wood houses  with doors and windows  the boiler was in the fore end  and the machinery right astern  over the whole there was a light roof  supported on stanchions  the funnel projected through that roof  and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot house  it contained a couch  two camp stools  a loaded martini henry leaning in one corner  a tiny table  and the steering wheel  it had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side  all these were always thrown open  of course  i spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore end of that roof  before the door  at night i slept  or tried to  on the couch  an athletic black belonging to some coast tribe  and educated by my poor predecessor  was the helmsman  he sported a pair of brass earrings  wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles  and thought all the world of himself  he was the most unstable kind of fool i had ever seen  he steered with no end of a swagger while you were by  but if he lost sight of you  he became instantly the prey of an abject funk  and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute    i was looking down at the sounding pole  and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river  when i saw my poleman give up the business suddenly  and stretch himself flat on the deck  without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in  he kept hold on it though  and it trailed in the water  at the same time the fireman  whom i could also see below me  sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head  i was amazed  then i had to look at the river mighty quick  because there was a snag in the fairway  sticks  little sticks  were flying about  thick  they were whizzing before my nose  dropping below me  striking behind me against my pilot house  all this time the river  the shore  the woods  were very quiet  perfectly quiet  i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern wheel and the patter of these things  we cleared the snag clumsily  arrows  by jove  we were being shot at  i stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land side  that fool helmsman  his hands on the spokes  was lifting his knees high  stamping his feet  champing his mouth  like a reined in horse  confound him  and we were staggering within ten feet of the bank  i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter  and i saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own  looking at me very fierce and steady  and then suddenly  as though a veil had been removed from my eyes  i made out  deep in the tangled gloom  naked breasts  arms  legs  glaring eyes   the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement  glistening  of bronze color  the twigs shook  swayed  and rustled  the arrows flew out of them  and then the shutter came to   ownteer her straight   i said to the helmsman  he held his head rigid  face forward  but his eyes rolled  he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently  his mouth foamed a little   keep quiet   i said in a fury  i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind  i darted out  below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck  confused exclamations  a voice screamed   can you turn back   i caught shape of a v shaped ripple on the water ahead  what  another snag  a fusillade burst out under my feet  the pilgrims had opened with their winchesters  and were simply squirting lead into that bush  a deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward  i swore at it  now i could not see the ripple or the snag either  i stood in the doorway  peering  and the arrows came in swarms  they might have been poisoned  but they looked as though they would not kill a cat  the bush began to howl  our wood cutters raised a warlike whoop  the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me  i glanced over my shoulder  and the pilot house was yet full of noise and smoke when i made a dash at the wheel  the fool nigger had dropped everything  to throw the shutter open and let off that martini henry  he stood before the wide opening  glaring  and i yelled at him to come back  while i straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat  there was no room to turn even if i had wanted to  the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke  there was no time to lose  so i just crowded her into the bank  right into the bank  where i knew the water was deep    we tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves  the fusillade below stopped short  as i had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty  i threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot house  in at one shutter hole and out at the other  looking past that mad helmsman  who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore  i saw vague forms of men running bent double  leaping  gliding  distinct  incomplete  evanescent  something big appeared in the air before the shutter  the rifle went overboard  and the man stepped back swiftly  looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary  profound  familiar manner  and fell upon my feet  the side of his head hit the wheel twice  and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp stool  it looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort  the thin smoke had blown away  we were clear of the snag  and looking ahead i could see that in another hundred yards or so i would be free to sheer off  away from the bank  but my feet felt so very warm and wet that i had to look down  the man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me  both his hands clutched that cane  it was the shaft of a spear that  either thrown or lunged through the opening  had caught him in the side just below the ribs  the blade had gone in out of sight  after making a frightful gash  my shoes were full  a pool of blood lay very still  gleaming dark red under the wheel  his eyes shone with an amazing luster  the fusillade burst out again  he looked at me anxiously  gripping the spear like something precious  with an air of being afraid i would try to take it away from him  i had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering  with one hand i felt above my head for the line of the steam whistle  and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly  the tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly  and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth  there was a great commotion in the bush  the shower of arrows stopped  a few dropping shots rang out sharply  then silence  in which the languid beat of the stern wheel came plainly to my ears  i put the helm hard a starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas  very hot and agitated  appeared in the doorway   the manager sends me    he began in an official tone  and stopped short   good god   he said  glaring at the wounded man    we two whites stood over him  and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both  i declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some question in an understandable language  but he died without uttering a sound  without moving a limb  without twitching a muscle  only in the very last moment  as though in response to some sign we could not see  to some whisper we could not hear  he frowned heavily  and that frown gave to his black death mask an inconceivably somber  brooding  and menacing expression  the luster of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness   can you steer   i asked the agent eagerly  he looked very dubious  but i made a grab at his arm  and he understood at once i meant him to steer whether or no  to tell you the truth  i was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks   he is dead   murmured the fellow  immensely impressed   no doubt about it   said i  tugging like mad at the shoe laces   and  by the way  i suppose mr  kurtz is dead as well by this time     for the moment that was the dominant thought  there was a sense of extreme disappointment  as though i had found out i had been striving after something altogether without a substance  i could not have been more disgusted if i had traveled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with mr  kurtz  talking with        i flung one shoe overboard  and became aware that that was exactly what i had been looking forward to  a talk with kurtz  i made the strange discovery that i had never imagined him as doing  you know  but as discoursing  i did not say to myself   now i will never see him   or  now i will never shake him by the hand   but   now i will never hear him   the man presented himself as a voice  not of course that i did not connect him with some sort of action  had not i been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected  bartered  swindled  or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together  that was not the point  the point was in his being a gifted creature  and that of all his gifts the one that stood out pre eminently  that carried with it a sense of real presence  was his ability to talk  his words  the gift of expression  the bewildering  the illuminating  the most exalted and the most contemptible  the pulsating stream of light  or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness    the other shoe went flying unto the devil god of that river  i thought   by jove  it is all over  we are too late  he has vanished  the gift has vanished  by means of some spear  arrow  or club  i will never hear that chap speak after all    and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion  even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush  i could not have felt more of lonely desolation somehow  had i been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life        why do you sigh in this beastly way  somebody  absurd  well  absurd  good lord  must not a man ever  here  give me some tobacco          there was a pause of profound stillness  then a match flared  and marlow own lean face appeared  worn  hollow  with downward folds and dropped eyelids  with an aspect of concentrated attention  and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe  it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame  the match went out    absurd   he cried   this is the worst of trying to tell        here you all are  each moored with two good addresses  like a hulk with two anchors  a butcher round one corner  a policeman round another  excellent appetites  and temperature normal  you hear  normal from year own end to year own end  and you say  absurd  absurd be  exploded  absurd  my dear boys  what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes  now i think of it  it is amazing i did not she would tears  i am  upon the whole  proud of my fortitude  i was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted kurtz  of course i was wrong  the privilege was waiting for me  oh yes  i heard more than enough  and i was right  too  a voice  he was very little more than a voice  and i heard  him  it  this voice  other voices  all of them were so little more than voices  and the memory of that time itself lingers around me  impalpable  like a dying vibration of one immense jabber  silly  atrocious  sordid  savage  or simply mean  without any kind of sense  voices  voices  even the girl herself  now     he was silent for a long time    i laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie   he began suddenly   girl  what  did i mention a girl  oh  she is out of it  completely  they  the women  i mean  are out of it  should be out of it  we must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own  lest ours gets worse  oh  she had to be out of it  you should have heard the disinterred body of mr  kurtz saying   my intended   you would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it  and the lofty frontal bone of mr  kurtz  they say the hair goes on growing sometimes  but this  ah specimen  was impressively bald  the wilderness had patted him on the head  and  behold  it was like a ball  an ivory ball  it had caressed him  and  lo   he had withered  it had taken him  loved him  embraced him  got into his veins  consumed his flesh  and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation  he was its spoiled and pampered favorite  ivory  i should think so  heaps of it  stacks of it  the old mud shanty was bursting with it  you would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below the ground in the whole country   mostly fossil   the manager had remarked disparagingly  it was no more fossil than i am  but they call it fossil when it is dug up  it appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimes  but evidently they could not bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted mr  kurtz from his fate  we filled the steamboat with it  and had to pile a lot on the deck  thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see  because the appreciation of this favor had remained with him to the last  you should have heard him say   my ivory   oh yes  i heard him   my intended  my ivory  my station  my river  my    everything belonged to him  it made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places  everything belonged to him  but that was a trifle  the thing was to know what he belonged to  how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own  that was the reflection that made you creepy all over  it was impossible  it was not good for one either  trying to imagine  he had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land  i mean literally  you cannot understand  how could you   with solid pavement under your feet  surrounded by kind neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you  stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman  in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums  how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man own untrammeled feet may take him into by the way of solitude  utter solitude without a policeman  by the way of silence  utter silence  where no warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard whispering of public opinion  these little things make all the great difference  when they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength  upon your own capacity for faithfulness  of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong  too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness  i take it  no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil  the fool is too much of a fool  or the devil too much of a devil  i do not know which  or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds  then the earth for you is only a standing place  and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain i will not pretend to say  but most of us are neither one nor the other  the earth for us is a place to live in  where we must put up with sights  with sounds  with smells too  by jove   breathe dead hippo  so to speak  and not be contaminated  and there  do not you see  your strength comes in  the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in  your power of devotion  not to yourself  but to an obscure  back breaking business  and that is difficult enough  mind  i am not trying to excuse or even explain  i am trying to account to myself for  for  mr  kurtz  for the shade of mr  kurtz  this initiated wraith from the back of nowhere honored me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether  this was because it could speak english to me  the original kurtz had been educated partly in england  and  as he was good enough to say himself  his sympathies were in the right place  his mother was half english  his father was half french  all europe contributed to the making of kurtz  and by and by i learned that  most appropriately  the international society for the suppression of savage customs had intrusted him with the making of a report  for its future guidance  and he had written it too  I have seen it  I have read it  it was eloquent  vibrating with eloquence  but too high strung  i think  seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for  but this must have been before his  let us say  nerves  went wrong  and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites  which  as far as i reluctantly gathered from what i heard at various times  were offered up to him  do you understand   to mr  kurtz himself  but it was a beautiful piece of writing  the opening paragraph  however  in the light of later information  strikes me now as ominous  he began with the argument that we whites  from the point of development we had arrived at   must necessarily appear to them   in the nature of supernatural beings  we approach them with the might as of a deity   and so on  and so on   by the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded    c    c  from that point he soared and took me with him  the peroration was magnificent  though difficult to remember  you know  it gave me the notion of an exotic immensity ruled by an august benevolence  it made me tingle with enthusiasm  this was the unbounded power of eloquence  of words  of burning noble words  there were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases  unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page  scrawled evidently much later  in an unsteady hand  may be regarded as the exposition of a method  it was very simple  and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you  luminous and terrifying  like a flash of lightning in a serene sky   exterminate all the brutes   the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum  because  later on  when he in a sense came to himself  he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of  my pamphlet   he called it   as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career  i had full information about all these things  and  besides  as it turned out  i was to have the care of his memory  I have done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it  if i choose  for an everlasting rest in the dust bin of progress  amongst all the sweepings and  figuratively speaking  all the dead cats of civilization  but then  you see  i cannot choose  he will not be forgotten  whatever he was  he was not common  he had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch dance in his honor  he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings  he had one devoted friend at least  and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self seeking  no  i cannot forget him  though i am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him  i missed my late helmsman awfully   i missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot house  perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black sahara  well  do not you see  he had done something  he had steered  for months i had him at my back  a help  an instrument  it was a kind of partnership  he steered for me  i had to look after him  i worried about his deficiencies  and thus a subtle bond had been created  of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken  and the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory  like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment    poor fool  if he had only left that shutter alone  he had no restraint  no restraint  just like kurtz  a tree swayed by the wind  as soon as i had put on a dry pair of slippers  i dragged him out  after first jerking the spear out of his side  which operation i confess i performed with my eyes shut tight  his heels leaped together over the little door step  his shoulders were pressed to my breast  i hugged him from behind desperately  oh  he was heavy  heavy  heavier than any man on earth  i should imagine  then without more ado i tipped him overboard  the current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass  and i saw the body roll over twice before i lost sight of it for ever  all the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning deck about the pilot house  chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies  and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude  what they wanted to keep that body hanging about for i cannot guess  embalm it  maybe  but i had also heard another  and a very ominous  murmur on the deck below  my friends the wood cutters were likewise scandalized  and with a better show of reason  though i admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible  oh  quite  i had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten  the fishes alone should have him  he had been a very second rate helmsman while alive  but now he was dead he might have become a first class temptation  and possibly because some startling trouble  besides  i was anxious to take the wheel  the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business    this i did directly the simple funeral was over  we were going half speed  keeping right in the middle of the stream  and i listened to the talk about me  they had given up kurtz  they had given up the station  kurtz was dead  and the station had been burnt  and so on  and so on  the red haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor kurtz had been properly revenged   ownay  we must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush  eh  what do you think  say   he positively danced  the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar  and he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man  i could not help saying   you made a glorious lot of smoke  anyhow   i had seen  from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew  that almost all the shots had gone too high  you cannot hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder  but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut  the retreat  i maintained  and i was right  was caused by the screeching of the steam whistle  upon this they forgot kurtz  and began to howl at me with indignant protests    the manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events  when i saw in the distance a clearing on the river side and the outlines of some sort of building   what is this   i asked  he clapped his hands in wonder   the station   he cried  i edged in at once  still going half speed    through my glasses i saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth  a long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass  the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar  the jungle and the woods made a background  there was no inclosure or fence of any kind  but there had been one apparently  for near the house half a dozen slim posts remained in a row  roughly trimmed  and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls  the rails  or whatever there had been between  had disappeared  of course the forest surrounded all that  the river bank was clear  and on the water side i saw a white man under a hat like a cart wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm  examining the edge of the forest above and below  i was almost certain i could see movements  human forms gliding here and there  i steamed past prudently  then stopped the engines and let her drift down  the man on the shore began to shout  urging us to land   we have been attacked   screamed the manager   i know  i know  it is all right   yelled back the other  as cheerful as you please   come along  it is all right  i am glad     his aspect reminded me of something i had seen  something funny i had seen somewhere  as i maneuvered to get alongside  i was asking myself   what does this fellow look like   suddenly i got it  he looked like a harlequin  his clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably  but it was covered with patches all over  with bright patches  blue  red  and yellow   patches on the back  patches on front  patches on elbows  on knees  colored binding round his jacket  scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers  and the sunshine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal  because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done  a beardless  boyish face  very fair  no features to speak of  nose peeling  little blue eyes  smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain   look out  captain   he cried   there is a snag lodged in here last night   what  another snag  i confess i swore shamefully  i had nearly holed my cripple  to finish off that charming trip  the harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose up to me   you english   he asked  all smiles   are you   i shouted from the wheel  the smiles vanished  and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment  then he brightened up   never mind   he cried encouragingly   are we in time   i asked   he is up there   he replied  with a toss of the head up the hill  and becoming gloomy all of a sudden  his face was like the autumn sky  overcast one moment and bright the next    when the manager  escorted by the pilgrims  all of them armed to the teeth  had gone to the house  this chap came on board   i say  i do not like this  these natives are in the bush   i said  he assured me earnestly it was all right   they are simple people   he added   well  i am glad you came  it took me all my time to keep them off    but you said it was all right   i cried   oh  they meant no harm   he said  and as i stared he corrected himself   not exactly   then vivaciously   my faith  your pilot house wants a clean up   in the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble   one good screech will do more for you than all your rifles  they are simple people   he repeated  he rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me  he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence  and actually hinted  laughing  that such was the case   do not you talk with mr  kurtz   i said   you do not talk with that man  you listen to him   he exclaimed with severe exaltation   but now    he waved his arm  and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost depths of despondency  in a moment he came up again with a jump  possessed himself of both my hands  shook them continuously  while he gabbled   brother sailor       honor       pleasure       delight       introduce myself       russian       son of an arch priest       government of tambov       what  tobacco  english tobacco  the excellent english tobacco  now  that is brotherly  smoke  where is a sailor that does not smoke     the pipe soothed him  and gradually i made out he had run away from school  had gone to sea in a russian ship  ran away again  served some time in english ships  was now reconciled with the arch priest  he made a point of that   but when one is young one must see things  gather experience  ideas  enlarge the mind    here   i interrupted   you can never tell  here i have met mr  kurtz   he said  youthfully solemn and reproachful  i held my tongue after that  it appears he had persuaded a dutch trading house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods  and had started for the interior with a light heart  and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby  he had been wandering about that river for nearly two years alone  cut off from everybody and everything   i am not so young as i look  i am twenty five   he said   at first old van shuyten would tell me to go to the devil   he narrated with keen enjoyment   but i stuck to him  and talked and talked  till at last he got afraid i would talk the hind leg off his favorite dog  so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns  and told me he hoped he would never see my face again  good old dutchman  van shuyten  I have sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago  so that he cannot call me a little thief when i get back  i hope he got it  and for the rest i do not care  i had some wood stacked for you  that was my old house  did you see     i gave him towson own book  he made as though he would kiss me  but restrained himself   the only book i had left  and i thought i had lost it   he said  looking at it ecstatically   owno many accidents happen to a man going about alone  you know  canoes get upset sometimes  and sometimes you have got to clear out so quick when the people get angry   he thumbed the pages   you made notes in russian   i asked  he nodded   i thought they were written in cipher   i said  he laughed  then became serious   i had lots of trouble to keep these people off   he said   did they want to kill you   i asked   oh no   he cried  and checked himself   why did they attack us   i

""I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in
motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic,
fabulous. His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and
altogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem. It was
inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so
far, how he had managed to remain--why he did not instantly disappear.
'I went a little farther,' he said, 'then still a little farther--till
I had gone so far that I don't know how I'll ever get back. Never mind.
Plenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away quick--quick--I tell
you.' The glamour of youth enveloped his particolored rags, his
destitution, his loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile
wanderings. For months--for years--his life hadn't been worth a day's
purchase; and there he was gallantly, thoughtlessly alive, to all
appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and
of his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced into something like
admiration--like envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed.
He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and
to push on through. His need was to exist, and to move onwards at
the greatest possible risk, and with a maximum of privation. If the
absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure had ever
ruled a human being, it ruled this be-patched youth. I almost envied
him the possession of this modest and clear flame. It seemed to have
consumed all thought of self so completely, that, even while he was
talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the man before your eyes--who
had gone through these things. I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz,
though. He had not meditated over it. It came to him, and he accepted it
with a sort of eager fatalism. I must say that to me it appeared about
the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far.

""They had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near
each other, and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an
audience, because on a certain occasion, when encamped in the forest,
they had talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked. 'We talked
of everything,' he said, quite transported at the recollection. 'I
forgot there was such a thing as sleep. The night did not seem to last
an hour. Everything! Everything! . . . Of love too.' 'Ah, he talked to
you of love!' I said, much amused. 'It isn't what you think,' he cried,
almost passionately. 'It was in general. He made me see things--things.'

""He threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman
of my wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and
glittering eyes. I looked around, and I don't know why, but I assure you
that never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle, the
very arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless and so dark, so
impenetrable to human thought, so pitiless to human weakness. 'And, ever
since, you have been with him, of course?' I said.

""On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken
by various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse
Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky
feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the
forest. 'Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and
days before he would turn up,' he said. 'Ah, it was worth waiting
for!--sometimes.' 'What was he doing? exploring or what?' I asked. 'Oh
yes, of course;' he had discovered lots of villages, a lake too--he
did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire
too much--but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. 'But he had no
goods to trade with by that time,' I objected. 'There's a good lot of
cartridges left even yet,' he answered, looking away. 'To speak plainly,
he raided the country,' I said. He nodded. 'Not alone, surely!' He
muttered something about the villages round that lake. 'Kurtz got the
tribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested. He fidgeted a little. 'They
adored him,' he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that
I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness
and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his
thoughts, swayed his emotions. 'What can you expect?' he burst out; 'he
came to them with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had never
seen anything like it--and very terrible. He could be very terrible.
You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no!
Now--just to give you an idea--I don't mind telling you, he wanted to
shoot me too one day--but I don't judge him.' 'Shoot you!' I cried.
'What for?' 'Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village
near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well,
he wanted it, and wouldn't hear reason. He declared he would shoot me
unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because
he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth
to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true too.
I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn't clear out. No, no. I
couldn't leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly
again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to
keep out of the way; but I didn't mind. He was living for the most part
in those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes
he would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful.
This man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn't
get away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there
was time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then
he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;
forget himself amongst these people--forget himself--you know.' 'Why!
he's mad,' I said. He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad.
If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at
such a thing. . . . I had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was
looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and
at the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in
that bush, so silent, so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house
on the hill--made me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature
of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in
desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in
hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask--heavy,
like the closed door of a prison--they looked with their air of hidden
knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The
Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had
come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of
that lake tribe. He had been absent for several months--getting himself
adored, I suppose--and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to
all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream.
Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the--what
shall I say?--less material aspirations. However he had got much worse
suddenly. 'I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came up--took my
chance,' said the Russian. 'Oh, he is bad, very bad.' I directed my
glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there was the
ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three
little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought
within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque movement,
and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the
field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the
distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the
ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its
first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. Then
I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake.
These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive
and puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought and also for
the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky; but at all
events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole.
They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes, if
their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the first I had
made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may think. The
start back I had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise.
I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I returned
deliberately to the first I had seen--and there it was, black, dried,
sunken, with closed eyelids,--a head that seemed to sleep at the top of
that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line
of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously at some endless and
jocose dream of that eternal slumber.

""I am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact the manager said
afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had ruined the district. I have no
opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there
was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only
showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his
various lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small
matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under
his magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I
can't say. I think the knowledge came to him at last--only at the very
last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a
terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered
to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he
had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the
whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him
because he was hollow at the core. . . . I put down the glass, and the
head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to
have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.

""The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen. In a hurried,
indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take
these--say, symbols--down. He was not afraid of the natives; they would
not stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendency was extraordinary.
The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came
every day to see him. They would crawl. . . . 'I don't want to know
anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I shouted.
Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more
intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz's
windows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at
one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle
horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being
something that had a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine. The
young man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did not occur to him
Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadn't heard any of these
splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of
life--or what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he
crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had no idea of the
conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him
excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I
was to hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workers--and these
were rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their
sticks. 'You don't know how such a life tries a man like Kurtz,' cried
Kurtz's last disciple. 'Well, and you?' I said. 'I! I! I am a simple
man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from anybody. How can
you compare me to . . .?' His feelings were too much for speech, and
suddenly he broke down. 'I don't understand,' he groaned. 'I've been
doing my best to keep him alive, and that's enough. I had no hand in
all this. I have no abilities. There hasn't been a drop of medicine or a
mouthful of invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned.
A man like this, with such ideas. Shamefully! Shamefully! I--I--haven't
slept for the last ten nights. . . .'

""His voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of
the forest had slipped down hill while we talked, had gone far beyond
the ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in the
gloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch
of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling
splendor, with a murky and over-shadowed bend above and below. Not a
living soul was seen on the shore. The bushes did not rustle.

""Suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as
though they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the
grass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their
midst. Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose
shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to
the very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human
beings--of naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with bows,
with shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into
the clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook, the
grass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive
immobility.

""'Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for,'
said the Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had
stopped too, half-way to the steamer, as if petrified. I saw the man on
the stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders
of the bearers. 'Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love
in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time,' I
said. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if
to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring
necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the
thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of
that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with
grotesque jerks. Kurtz--Kurtz--that means short in German--don't it?
Well, the name was as true as everything else in his life--and death.
He looked at least seven feet long. His covering had fallen off, and his
body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. I
could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.
It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had
been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of
dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him
a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the
air, all the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached
me faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The
stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at
the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without
any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected
these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn
in a long aspiration.

""Some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms--two
shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbine--the thunderbolts
of that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him murmuring as
he walked beside his head. They laid him down in one of the little
cabins--just a room for a bed-place and a camp-stool or two, you know.
We had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn envelopes
and open letters littered his bed. His hand roamed feebly amongst these
papers. I was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of
his expression. It was not so much the exhaustion of disease. He did not
seem in pain. This shadow looked satiated and calm, as though for the
moment it had had its fill of all the emotions.

""He rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said,
'I am glad.' Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special
recommendations were turning up again. The volume of tone he emitted
without effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed
me. A voice! a voice! It was grave, profound, vibrating, while the man
did not seem capable of a whisper. However, he had enough strength in
him--factitious no doubt--to very nearly make an end of us, as you shall
hear directly.

""The manager appeared silently in the doorway; I stepped out at once
and he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the
pilgrims, was staring at the shore. I followed the direction of his
glance.

""Dark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting
indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the river
two bronze figures, leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under
fantastic headdresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque
repose. And from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and
gorgeous apparition of a woman.

""She walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths,
treading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous
ornaments. She carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of
a helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to
the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of
glass beads on her neck; bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men,
that hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step. She must have
had the value of several elephant tusks upon her. She was savage and
superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and
stately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had fallen
suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the
colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her,
pensive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous
and passionate soul.

""She came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long
shadow fell to the water's edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce
aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some
struggling, half-shaped resolve. She stood looking at us without a
stir and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an
inscrutable purpose. A whole minute passed, and then she made a step
forward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of
fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. The
young fellow by my side growled. The pilgrims murmured at my back.
She looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving
steadiness of her glance. Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw
them up rigid above her head, as though in an uncontrollable desire to
touch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the
earth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy
embrace. A formidable silence hung over the scene.

""She turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into
the bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the
dusk of the thickets before she disappeared.

""'If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried to
shoot her,' said the man of patches, nervously. 'I had been risking my
life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. She
got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked
up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with. I wasn't decent. At least
it must have been that, for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour,
pointing at me now and then. I don't understand the dialect of this
tribe. Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day to care, or
there would have been mischief. I don't understand. . . . No--it's too
much for me. Ah, well, it's all over now.'

""At this moment I heard Kurtz's deep voice behind the curtain, 'Save
me!--save the ivory, you mean. Don't tell me. Save _me!_ Why, I've had
to save you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick
as you would like to believe. Never mind. I'll carry my ideas out
yet--I will return. I'll show you what can be done. You with your little
peddling notions--you are interfering with me. I will return. I . . .'

""The manager came out. He did me the honor to take me under the arm and
lead me aside. 'He is very low, very low,' he said. He considered it
necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. 'We have
done all we could for him--haven't we? But there is no disguising the
fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company. He did
not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. Cautiously,
cautiously--that's my principle. We must be cautious yet. The district
is closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will
suffer. I don't deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly
fossil. We must save it, at all events--but look how precarious the
position is--and why? Because the method is unsound.' 'Do you,' said I,
looking at the shore, 'call it ""unsound method""?' 'Without doubt,' he
exclaimed, hotly. 'Don't you?' . . . 'No method at all,' I murmured
after a while. 'Exactly,' he exulted. 'I anticipated this. Shows a
complete want of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the proper
quarter.' 'Oh,' said I, 'that fellow--what's his name?--the brickmaker,
will make a readable report for you.' He appeared confounded for a
moment. It seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile,
and I turned mentally to Kurtz for relief--positively for relief.
'Nevertheless I think Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,' I said with
emphasis. He started, dropped on me a cold heavy glance, said very
quietly, 'He _was_,' and turned his back on me. My hour of favor was
over; I found myself lumped along with Kurtz as a partisan of methods
for which the time was not ripe: I was unsound! Ah! but it was something
to have at least a choice of nightmares.

""I had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was
ready to admit, was as good as buried. And for a moment it seemed to me
as if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I
felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp
earth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an
impenetrable night. . . . The Russian tapped me on the shoulder. I heard
him mumbling and stammering something about 'brother seaman--couldn't
conceal--knowledge of matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz's reputation.'
I waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave; I suspect
that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. 'Well!' said I at last,
'speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtz's friend--in a way.'

""He stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been 'of the
same profession,' he would have kept the matter to himself without
regard to consequences. 'He suspected there was an active ill-will
towards him on the part of these white men that--' 'You are right,' I
said, remembering a certain conversation I had overheard. 'The manager
thinks you ought to be hanged.' He showed a concern at this intelligence
which amused me at first. 'I had better get out of the way quietly,' he
said, earnestly. 'I can do no more for Kurtz now, and they would soon
find some excuse. What's to stop them? There's a military post three
hundred miles from here.' 'Well, upon my word,' said I, 'perhaps you
had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by.'
'Plenty,' he said. 'They are simple people--and I want nothing, you
know.' He stood biting his lips, then: 'I don't want any harm to happen
to these whites here, but of course I was thinking of Mr. Kurtz's
reputation--but you are a brother seaman and--' 'All right,' said I,
after a time. 'Mr. Kurtz's reputation is safe with me.' I did not know
how truly I spoke.

""He informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered
the attack to be made on the steamer. 'He hated sometimes the idea of
being taken away--and then again. . . . But I don't understand these
matters. I am a simple man. He thought it would scare you away--that you
would give it up, thinking him dead. I could not stop him. Oh, I had an
awful time of it this last month.' 'Very well,' I said. 'He is all right
now.' 'Ye-e-es,' he muttered, not very convinced apparently. 'Thanks,'
said I; 'I shall keep my eyes open.' 'But quiet--eh?' he urged,
anxiously. 'It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here--' I
promised a complete discretion with great gravity. 'I have a canoe and
three black fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a
few Martini-Henry cartridges?' I could, and did, with proper secrecy. He
helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco. 'Between
sailors--you know--good English tobacco.' At the door of the pilot-house
he turned round--' I say, haven't you a pair of shoes you could spare?'
He raised one leg. 'Look.' The soles were tied with knotted strings
sandal-wise under his bare feet. I rooted out an old pair, at which he
looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm. One of his
pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the other (dark
blue) peeped 'Towson's Inquiry,' &c., &c. He seemed to think himself
excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.
'Ah! I'll never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard
him recite poetry--his own too it was, he told me. Poetry!' He rolled
his eyes at the recollection of these delights. 'Oh, he enlarged my
mind!' 'Goodby,' said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night.
Sometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen him--whether it
was possible to meet such a phenomenon! . . .

""When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with
its hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to
make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a
big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the
station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,
armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within
the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from
the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed
the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping
their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air
with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of
many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from
the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of
a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.
I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of
yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke
me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the
low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I
glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but
Mr. Kurtz was not there.

""I think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I
didn't believe them at first--the thing seemed so impossible. The fact
is I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract
terror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger. What
made this emotion so overpowering was--how shall I define it?--the moral
shock I received, as if something altogether monstrous, intolerable to
thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me unexpectedly.
This lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and then the
usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of a sudden
onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw impending,
was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in fact, so much,
that I did not raise an alarm.

""There was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair
on deck within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him; he
snored very slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore. I
did not betray Mr. Kurtz--it was ordered I should never betray him--it
was written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was
anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone,--and to this day I
don't know why I was so jealous of sharing with anyone the peculiar
blackness of that experience.

""As soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail--a broad trail through the
grass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, 'He can't
walk--he is crawling on all-fours--I've got him.' The grass was wet
with dew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague
notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I don't know. I
had some imbecile thoughts. The knitting old woman with the cat obtruded
herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the
other end of such an affair. I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in
the air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought I would never get
back to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the
woods to an advanced age. Such silly things--you know. And I remember
I confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was
pleased at its calm regularity.

""I kept to the track though--then stopped to listen. The night was very
clear: a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which
black things stood very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion
ahead of me. I was strangely cocksure of everything that night. I
actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (I verily believe
chuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion
I had seen--if indeed I had seen anything. I was circumventing Kurtz as
though it had been a boyish game.

""I came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have
fallen over him too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long,
pale, indistinct, like a vapor exhaled by the earth, and swayed
slightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed
between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.
I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I seemed
to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion. It was
by no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could hardly
stand, there was still plenty of vigor in his voice. 'Go away--hide
yourself,' he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced
back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure
stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the
glow. It had horns--antelope horns, I think--on its head. Some sorcerer,
some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiend-like enough. 'Do you know what
you are doing?' I whispered. 'Perfectly,' he answered, raising his voice
for that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail
through a speaking-trumpet. 'If he makes a row we are lost,' I thought
to myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from
the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and
tormented thing. 'You will be lost,' I said--'utterly lost.' One gets
sometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the right
thing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than
he was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were
being laid--to endure--to endure--even to the end--even beyond.

""'I had immense plans,' he muttered irresolutely. 'Yes,' said I; 'but if
you try to shout I'll smash your head with--' There was not a stick or
a stone near. 'I will throttle you for good,' I corrected myself. 'I was
on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice of longing,
with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. 'And now for
this stupid scoundrel--' 'Your success in Europe is assured in any
case,' I affirmed, steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of
him, you understand--and indeed it would have been very little use for
any practical purpose. I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell
of the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified
and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out
to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the
throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled
his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations. And, don't
you see, the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the
head--though I had a very lively sense of that danger too--but in this,
that I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the
name of anything high or low. I had, even like the niggers, to invoke
him--himself his own exalted and incredible degradation. There was
nothing either above or below him, and I knew it. He had kicked himself
loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had kicked the very earth to
pieces. He was alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood
on the ground or floated in the air. I've been telling you what we
said--repeating the phrases we pronounced,--but what's the good? They
were common everyday words,--the familiar, vague sounds exchanged on
every waking day of life. But what of that? They had behind them, to my
mind, the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases
spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody had ever struggled with a soul,
I am the man. And I wasn't arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me
or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear--concentrated, it is true,
upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only
chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and then, which wasn't
so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was mad. Being
alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I
tell you, it had gone mad. I had--for my sins, I suppose--to go through
the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could have been so
withering to one's belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity.
He struggled with himself, too. I saw it,--I heard it. I saw the
inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and
no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty well;
but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead,
while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton on my
back down that hill. And yet I had only supported him, his bony arm
clasped round my neck--and he was not much heavier than a child.

""When next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the
curtain of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out
of the woods again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass
of naked, breathing, quivering, bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then
swung down-stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of
the splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its
terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air. In front of the
first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth
from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we came abreast
again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned
heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce
river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent
tail--something that looked like a dried gourd; they shouted
periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds
of human language; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted
suddenly, were like the response of some satanic litany.

""We had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there.
Lying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter. There was an
eddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and
tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. She put out her
hands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout in a
roaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.

""'Do you understand this?' I asked.

""He kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a mingled
expression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I saw a
smile, a smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colorless lips
that a moment after twitched convulsively. 'Do I not?' he said slowly,
gasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural
power.

""I pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the
pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a
jolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror
through that wedged mass of bodies. 'Don't! Don't you frighten them
away,' cried someone on deck disconsolately. I pulled the string
time after time. They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they
swerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound. The three red chaps
had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot
dead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch,
and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the somber and
glittering river.

""And then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun,
and I could see nothing more for smoke.

""The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us
down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and
Kurtz's life was running swiftly too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart
into the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had
no vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and
satisfied glance: the 'affair' had come off as well as could be wished.
I saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of
'unsound method.' The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavor. I was,
so to speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I accepted this
unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the
tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.

""Kurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It
survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the
barren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes
of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now--images of wealth
and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of
noble and lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my
ideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated
sentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of
the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mold of
primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of
the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that
soul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham
distinction, of all the appearances of success and power.

""Sometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet
him at railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where
he intended to accomplish great things. 'You show them you have in you
something that is really profitable, and then there will be no limits to
the recognition of your ability,' he would say. 'Of course you must take
care of the motives--right motives--always.' The long reaches that were
like one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike,
slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking
patiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner
of change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings. I looked
ahead--piloting. 'Close the shutter,' said Kurtz suddenly one day; 'I
can't bear to look at this.' I did so. There was a silence. 'Oh, but I
will wring your heart yet!' he cried at the invisible wilderness.

""We broke down--as I had expected--and had to lie up for repairs at the
head of an island. This delay was the first thing that shook
Kurtz's confidence. One morning he gave me a packet of papers and a
photograph,--the lot tied together with a shoe-string. 'Keep this for
me,' he said. 'This noxious fool' (meaning the manager) 'is capable of
prying into my boxes when I am not looking.' In the afternoon I saw him.
He was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but
I heard him mutter, 'Live rightly, die, die . . .' I listened. There was
nothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a
fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing
for the papers and meant to do so again, 'for the furthering of my
ideas. It's a duty.'

""His was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at
a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never
shines. But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the
engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to straighten a
bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an
infernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers,
ratchet-drills--things I abominate, because I don't get on with them. I
tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a
wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.

""One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a
little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.'
The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh,
nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.

""Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have
never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn't touched.
I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that
ivory face the expression of somber pride, of ruthless power, of craven
terror--of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again
in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme
moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at
some vision,--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath--

""'The horror! The horror!'

""I blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in
the mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his
eyes to give me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored.
He leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the
unexpressed depths of his meanness. A continuous shower of small flies
streamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.
Suddenly the manager's boy put his insolent black head in the doorway,
and said in a tone of scathing contempt--

""'Mistah Kurtz--he dead.'

""All the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my
dinner. I believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not
eat much. There was a lamp in there--light, don't you know--and outside
it was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man
who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this
earth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course
aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole.

""And then they very nearly buried me.

""However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did
not. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show
my loyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life
is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.
The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself--that comes
too late--a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with
death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place
in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,
without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great
desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly
atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right,
and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of
ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think
it to be. I was within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for
pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would
have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a
remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped
over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that
could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace
the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that
beat in the darkness. He had summed up--he had judged. 'The horror!' He
was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort
of belief; it had candor, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note
of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed
truth--the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own
extremity I remember best--a vision of grayness without form filled
with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all
things--even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to
have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped
over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating
foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the
wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that
inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the
invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been
a word of careless contempt. Better his cry--much better. It was
an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by
abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory!
That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,
when a long time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but
the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as
translucently pure as a cliff of crystal.

""No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I
remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some
inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself
back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying
through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour
their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their
insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They
were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense,
because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew.
Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals
going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was
offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of
a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to
enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from
laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance. I dare say I was
not very well at that time. I tottered about the streets--there were
various affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable
persons. I admit my behavior was inexcusable, but then my temperature
was seldom normal in these days. My dear aunt's endeavors to 'nurse up
my strength' seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength
that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept
the bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do
with it. His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by
his Intended. A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing
gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at
first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased
to denominate certain 'documents.' I was not surprised, because I had
had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused
to give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same
attitude with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last,
and with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit
of information about its 'territories.' And, said he, 'Mr. Kurtz's
knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive
and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable
circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore'--I assured him Mr.
Kurtz's knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems
of commerce or administration. He invoked then the name of science. 'It
would be an incalculable loss if,' &c., &c. I offered him the report on
the 'Suppression of Savage Customs,' with the postscriptum torn off. He
took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt.
'This is not what we had a right to expect,' he remarked. 'Expect
nothing else,' I said. 'There are only private letters.' He withdrew
upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more; but
another fellow, calling himself Kurtz's cousin, appeared two days later,
and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative's last
moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had been
essentially a great musician. 'There was the making of an immense
success,' said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank gray
hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt
his statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's
profession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest of his
talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else
for a journalist who could paint--but even the cousin (who took snuff
during the interview) could not tell me what he had been--exactly. He
was a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the old chap, who
thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and
withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and
memoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know
something of the fate of his 'dear colleague' turned up. This visitor
informed me Kurtz's proper sphere ought to have been politics 'on the
popular side.' He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped
short, an eye-glass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive,
confessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldn't write a bit--'but
heavens! how that man could talk! He electrified large meetings. He had
faith--don't you see?--he had the faith. He could get himself to believe
anything--anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme
party.' 'What party?' I asked. 'Any party,' answered the other. 'He
was an--an--extremist.' Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he
asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, 'what it was that had induced
him to go out there?' 'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the
famous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it
hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it would do,' and took himself
off with this plunder.

""Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl's
portrait. She struck me as beautiful--I mean she had a beautiful
expression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie too, yet one
felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the
delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to
listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought
for herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait
and those letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling
perhaps. All that had been Kurtz's had passed out of my hands: his soul,
his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained
only his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that up too to
the past, in a way,--to surrender personally all that remained of him
with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. I
don't defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really
wanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the
fulfillment of one of these ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of
human existence. I don't know. I can't tell. But I went.

""I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that
accumulate in every man's life,--a vague impress on the brain of shadows
that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the
high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still
and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him
on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the
earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much
as he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of
frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and
draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to
enter the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild
crowd of obedient worshipers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of
the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and
muffled like the beating of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.
It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful
rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the
salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say
afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of
fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to
me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I
remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale
of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish
of his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner,
when he said one day, 'This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company
did not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.
I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. H'm. It is a
difficult case. What do you think I ought to do--resist? Eh? I want no
more than justice.' . . . He wanted no more than justice--no more than
justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and
while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare
with that wide and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all the
universe. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The horror! The horror!'

""The dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three
long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and
bedraped columns. The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in
indistinct curves. The tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental
whiteness. A grand piano stood massively in a corner, with dark gleams
on the flat surfaces like a somber and polished sarcophagus. A high door
opened--closed. I rose.

""She came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards
me in the dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his
death, more than a year since the news came; she seemed as though she
would remember and mourn for ever. She took both my hands in hers and
murmured, 'I had heard you were coming.' I noticed she was not very
young--I mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for
belief, for suffering. The room seemed to have grown darker, as if all
the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead.
This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by
an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance was
guileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her sorrowful
head as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say,
'I--I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.' But while we were
still shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her
face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the
playthings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by Jove!
the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died
only yesterday--nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in the same
instant of time--his death and her sorrow--I saw her sorrow in the very
moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together--I heard
them together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, 'I have
survived;' while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled
with her tone of despairing regret, the summing-up whisper of his
eternal condemnation. I asked myself what I was doing there, with a
sensation of panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place
of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold. She
motioned me to a chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on the
little table, and she put her hand over it. . . . 'You knew him well,'
she murmured, after a moment of mourning silence.

""'Intimacy grows quick out there,' I said. 'I knew him as well as it is
possible for one man to know another.'

""'And you admired him,' she said. 'It was impossible to know him and not
to admire him. Was it?'

""'He was a remarkable man,' I said, unsteadily. Then before the
appealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my
lips, I went on, 'It was impossible not to--'

""'Love him,' she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled
dumbness. 'How true! how true! But when you think that no one knew him
so well as I! I had all his noble confidence. I knew him best.'

""'You knew him best,' I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every
word spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth
and white, remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief
and love.

""'You were his friend,' she went on. 'His friend,' she repeated, a
little louder. 'You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent
you to me. I feel I can speak to you--and oh! I must speak. I want
you--you who have heard his last words--to know I have been worthy of
him. . . . It is not pride. . . . Yes! I am proud to know I understood
him better than anyone on earth--he told me so himself. And since his
mother died I have had no one--no one--to--to--'

""I listened. The darkness deepened. I was not even sure whether he had
given me the right bundle. I rather suspect he wanted me to take care
of another batch of his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager
examining under the lamp. And the girl talked, easing her pain in the
certitude of my sympathy; she talked as thirsty men drink. I had heard
that her engagement with Kurtz had been disapproved by her people. He
wasn't rich enough or something. And indeed I don't know whether he had
not been a pauper all his life. He had given me some reason to infer
that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out
there.

""'. . . Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?' she was
saying. 'He drew men towards him by what was best in them.' She looked
at me with intensity. 'It is the gift of the great,' she went on, and
the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all
the other sounds, full of mystery, desolation, and sorrow, I had ever
heard--the ripple of the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by the
wind, the murmurs of wild crowds, the faint ring of incomprehensible
words cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the
threshold of an eternal darkness. 'But you have heard him! You know!'
she cried.

""'Yes, I know,' I said with something like despair in my heart, but
bowing my head before the faith that was in her, before that great and
saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in
the triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended her--from
which I could not even defend myself.

""'What a loss to me--to us!'--she corrected herself with beautiful
generosity; then added in a murmur, 'To the world.' By the last gleams
of twilight I could see the glitter of her eyes, full of tears--of tears
that would not fall.

""'I have been very happy--very fortunate--very proud,' she went on. 'Too
fortunate. Too happy for a little while. And now I am unhappy for--for
life.'

""She stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in
a glimmer of gold. I rose too.

""'And of all this,' she went on, mournfully, 'of all his promise, and
of all his greatness, of his generous mind, of his noble heart, nothing
remains--nothing but a memory. You and I--'

""'We shall always remember him,' I said, hastily.

""'No!' she cried. 'It is impossible that all this should be lost--that
such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing--but sorrow. You
know what vast plans he had. I knew of them too--I could not perhaps
understand,--but others knew of them. Something must remain. His words,
at least, have not died.'

""'His words will remain,' I said.

""'And his example,' she whispered to herself. 'Men looked up to
him,--his goodness shone in every act. His example--'

""'True,' I said; 'his example too. Yes, his example. I forgot that.'

""'But I do not. I cannot--I cannot believe--not yet. I cannot believe
that I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again, never,
never, never.'

""She put out her arms as if after a retreating figure, stretching them
black and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of
the window. Never see him! I saw him clearly enough then. I shall see
this eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her too, a
tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one,
tragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown
arms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.
She said suddenly very low, 'He died as he lived.'

""'His end,' said I, with dull anger stirring in me, 'was in every way
worthy of his life.'

""'And I was not with him,' she murmured. My anger subsided before a
feeling of infinite pity.

""'Everything that could be done--' I mumbled.

""'Ah, but I believed in him more than anyone on earth--more than his
own mother, more than--himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured
every sigh, every word, every sign, every glance.'

""I felt like a chill grip on my chest. 'Don't,' I said, in a muffled
voice.

""'Forgive me. I--I--have mourned so long in silence--in silence. . . .
You were with him--to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near
to understand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to
hear. . . .'

""'To the very end,' I said, shakily. 'I heard his very last words. . . .'
I stopped in a fright.

""'Repeat them,' she said in a heart-broken tone. 'I want--I
want--something--something--to--to live with.'

""I was on the point of crying at her, 'Don't you hear them?' The dusk
was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper
that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind.
'The horror! The horror!'

""'His last word--to live with,' she murmured. 'Don't you understand I
loved him--I loved him--I loved him!'

""I pulled myself together and spoke slowly.

""'The last word he pronounced was--your name.'

""I heard a light sigh, and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short
by an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and
of unspeakable pain. 'I knew it--I was sure!' . . . She knew. She was
sure. I heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. It
seemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that
the heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens
do not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I
had rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn't he said he
wanted only justice? But I couldn't. I could not tell her. It would have
been too dark--too dark altogether. . . .""

Marlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a
meditating Buddha. Nobody moved for a time. ""We have lost the first of
the ebb,"" said the Director, suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was
barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading
to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under an overcast
sky--seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.
",   i looked at him  lost in astonishment  there he was before me  in motley  as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes  enthusiastic  fabulous  his very existence was improbable  inexplicable  and altogether bewildering  he was an insoluble problem  it was inconceivable how he had existed  how he had succeeded in getting so far  how he had managed to remain  why he did not instantly disappear   i went a little farther   he said   then still a little farther  till i had gone so far that i do not know how I will ever get back  never mind  plenty time  i can manage  you take kurtz away quick  quick  i tell you   the glamour of youth enveloped his particolored rags  his destitution  his loneliness  the essential desolation of his futile wanderings  for months  for years  his life had not been worth a day own purchase  and there he was gallantly  thoughtlessly alive  to all appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and of his unreflecting audacity  i was seduced into something like admiration  like envy  glamour urged him on  glamour kept him unscathed  he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and to push on through  his need was to exist  and to move onwards at the greatest possible risk  and with a maximum of privation  if the absolutely pure  uncalculating  unpractical spirit of adventure had ever ruled a human being  it ruled this be patched youth  i almost envied him the possession of this modest and clear flame  it seemed to have consumed all thought of self so completely  that  even while he was talking to you  you forgot that it was he  the man before your eyes  who had gone through these things  i did not envy him his devotion to kurtz  though  he had not meditated over it  it came to him  and he accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism  i must say that to me it appeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far    they had come together unavoidably  like two ships becalmed near each other  and lay rubbing sides at last  i suppose kurtz wanted an audience  because on a certain occasion  when encamped in the forest  they had talked all night  or more probably kurtz had talked   we talked of everything   he said  quite transported at the recollection   i forgot there was such a thing as sleep  the night did not seem to last an hour  everything  everything        of love too    ah  he talked to you of love   i said  much amused   it is not what you think   he cried  almost passionately   it was in general  he made me see things  things     he threw his arms up  we were on deck at the time  and the headman of my wood cutters  lounging near by  turned upon him his heavy and glittering eyes  i looked around  and i do not know why  but i assure you that never  never before  did this land  this river  this jungle  the very arch of this blazing sky  appear to me so hopeless and so dark  so impenetrable to human thought  so pitiless to human weakness   and  ever since  you have been with him  of course   i said    on the contrary  it appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes  he had  as he informed me proudly  managed to nurse kurtz through two illnesses  he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat   but as a rule kurtz wandered alone  far in the depths of the forest   very often coming to this station  i had to wait days and days before he would turn up   he said   ah  it was worth waiting for   sometimes    what was he doing  exploring or what   i asked   oh yes  of course   he had discovered lots of villages  a lake too  he did not know exactly in what direction  it was dangerous to inquire too much  but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory   but he had no goods to trade with by that time   i objected   there is a good lot of cartridges left even yet   he answered  looking away   to speak plainly  he raided the country   i said  he nodded   not alone  surely   he muttered something about the villages round that lake   kurtz got the tribe to follow him  did he   i suggested  he fidgeted a little   they adored him   he said  the tone of these words was so extraordinary that i looked at him searchingly  it was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of kurtz  the man filled his life  occupied his thoughts  swayed his emotions   what can you expect   he burst out   he came to them with thunder and lightning  you know  and they had never seen anything like it  and very terrible  he could be very terrible  you cannot judge mr  kurtz as you would an ordinary man  no  no  no  now  just to give you an idea  i do not mind telling you  he wanted to shoot me too one day  but i do not judge him    ownhoot you   i cried   what for    well  i had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me  you see i used to shoot game for them  well  he wanted it  and would not hear reason  he declared he would shoot me unless i gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country  because he could do so  and had a fancy for it  and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased  and it was true too  i gave him the ivory  what did i care  but i did not clear out  no  no  i could not leave him  i had to be careful  of course  till we got friendly again for a time  he had his second illness then  afterwards i had to keep out of the way  but i did not mind  he was living for the most part in those villages on the lake  when he came down to the river  sometimes he would take to me  and sometimes it was better for me to be careful  this man suffered too much  he hated all this  and somehow he could not get away  when i had a chance i begged him to try and leave while there was time  i offered to go back with him  and he would say yes  and then he would remain  go off on another ivory hunt  disappear for weeks  forget himself amongst these people  forget himself  you know    why  he is mad   i said  he protested indignantly  mr  kurtz could not be mad  if i had heard him talk  only two days ago  i would not dare hint at such a thing        i had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was looking at the shore  sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house  the consciousness of there being people in that bush  so silent  so quiet  as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hill  made me uneasy  there was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations  completed by shrugs  in interrupted phrases  in hints ending in deep sighs  the woods were unmoved  like a mask  heavy  like the closed door of a prison  they looked with their air of hidden knowledge  of patient expectation  of unapproachable silence  the russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that mr  kurtz had come down to the river  bringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe  he had been absent for several months  getting himself adored  i suppose  and had come down unexpectedly  with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream  evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the  what shall i say   less material aspirations  however he had got much worse suddenly   i heard he was lying helpless  and so i came up  took my chance   said the russian   oh  he is bad  very bad   i directed my glass to the house  there were no signs of life  but there was the ruined roof  the long mud wall peeping above the grass  with three little square window holes  no two of the same size  all this brought within reach of my hand  as it were  and then i made a brusque movement  and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass  you remember i told you i had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation  rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place  now i had suddenly a nearer view  and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow  then i went carefully from post to post with my glass  and i saw my mistake  these round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic  they were expressive and puzzling  striking and disturbing  food for thought and also for the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky  but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole  they would have been even more impressive  those heads on the stakes  if their faces had not been turned to the house  only one  the first i had made out  was facing my way  i was not so shocked as you may think  the start back i had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise  i had expected to see a knob of wood there  you know  i returned deliberately to the first i had seen  and there it was  black  dried  sunken  with closed eyelids   a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole  and  with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth  was smiling too  smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber    i am not disclosing any trade secrets  in fact the manager said afterwards that mr  kurtz own methods had ruined the district  i have no opinion on that point  but i want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there  they only showed that mr  kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts  that there was something wanting in him  some small matter which  when the pressing need arose  could not be found under his magnificent eloquence  whether he knew of this deficiency himself i cannot say  i think the knowledge came to him at last  only at the very last  but the wilderness had found him out early  and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion  i think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know  things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude  and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating  it echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core        i put down the glass  and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance    the admirer of mr  kurtz was a bit crestfallen  in a hurried  indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take these  say  symbols  down  he was not afraid of the natives  they would not stir till mr  kurtz gave the word  his ascendency was extraordinary  the camps of these people surrounded the place  and the chiefs came every day to see him  they would crawl         i do not want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching mr  kurtz   i shouted  curious  this feeling that came over me that such details would be more intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under mr  kurtz own windows  after all  that was only a savage sight  while i seemed at one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle horrors  where pure  uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief  being something that had a right to exist  obviously  in the sunshine  the young man looked at me with surprise  i suppose it did not occur to him mr  kurtz was no idol of mine  he forgot i had not heard any of these splendid monologues on  what was it  on love  justice  conduct of life  or what not  if it had come to crawling before mr  kurtz  he crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all  i had no idea of the conditions  he said  these heads were the heads of rebels  i shocked him excessively by laughing  rebels  what would be the next definition i was to hear  there had been enemies  criminals  workers  and these were rebels  those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their sticks   you do not know how such a life tries a man like kurtz   cried kurtz own last disciple   well  and you   i said   i  i  i am a simple man  i have no great thoughts  i want nothing from anybody  how can you compare me to         his feelings were too much for speech  and suddenly he broke down   i do not understand   he groaned   I have been doing my best to keep him alive  and that is enough  i had no hand in all this  i have no abilities  there has not been a drop of medicine or a mouthful of invalid food for months here  he was shamefully abandoned  a man like this  with such ideas  shamefully  shamefully  i  i  have not slept for the last ten nights           his voice lost itself in the calm of the evening  the long shadows of the forest had slipped down hill while we talked  had gone far beyond the ruined hovel  beyond the symbolic row of stakes  all this was in the gloom  while we down there were yet in the sunshine  and the stretch of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling splendor  with a murky and over shadowed bend above and below  not a living soul was seen on the shore  the bushes did not rustle    suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared  as though they had come up from the ground  they waded waist deep in the grass  in a compact body  bearing an improvised stretcher in their midst  instantly  in the emptiness of the landscape  a cry arose whose shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to the very heart of the land  and  as if by enchantment  streams of human beings  of naked human beings  with spears in their hands  with bows  with shields  with wild glances and savage movements  were poured into the clearing by the dark faced and pensive forest  the bushes shook  the grass swayed for a time  and then everything stood still in attentive immobility     now  if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for   said the russian at my elbow  the knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too  half way to the steamer  as if petrified  i saw the man on the stretcher sit up  lank and with an uplifted arm  above the shoulders of the bearers   let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time   i said  i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation  as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring necessity  i could not hear a sound  but through my glasses i saw the thin arm extended commandingly  the lower jaw moving  the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks  kurtz  kurtz  that means short in german  do not it  well  the name was as true as everything else in his life  and death  he looked at least seven feet long  his covering had fallen off  and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding sheet  i could see the cage of his ribs all astir  the bones of his arm waving  it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze  i saw him open his mouth wide  it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect  as though he had wanted to swallow all the air  all the earth  all the men before him  a deep voice reached me faintly  he must have been shouting  he fell back suddenly  the stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again  and almost at the same time i noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat  as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration    some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his arms  two shot guns  a heavy rifle  and a light revolver carbine  the thunderbolts of that pitiful jupiter  the manager bent over him murmuring as he walked beside his head  they laid him down in one of the little cabins  just a room for a bed place and a camp stool or two  you know  we had brought his belated correspondence  and a lot of torn envelopes and open letters littered his bed  his hand roamed feebly amongst these papers  i was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of his expression  it was not so much the exhaustion of disease  he did not seem in pain  this shadow looked satiated and calm  as though for the moment it had had its fill of all the emotions    he rustled one of the letters  and looking straight in my face said   i am glad   somebody had been writing to him about me  these special recommendations were turning up again  the volume of tone he emitted without effort  almost without the trouble of moving his lips  amazed me  a voice  a voice  it was grave  profound  vibrating  while the man did not seem capable of a whisper  however  he had enough strength in him  factitious no doubt  to very nearly make an end of us  as you shall hear directly    the manager appeared silently in the doorway  i stepped out at once and he drew the curtain after me  the russian  eyed curiously by the pilgrims  was staring at the shore  i followed the direction of his glance    dark human shapes could be made out in the distance  flitting indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest  and near the river two bronze figures  leaning on tall spears  stood in the sunlight under fantastic headdresses of spotted skins  warlike and still in statuesque repose  and from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and gorgeous apparition of a woman    she walked with measured steps  draped in striped and fringed cloths  treading the earth proudly  with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments  she carried her head high  her hair was done in the shape of a helmet  she had brass leggings to the knee  brass wire gauntlets to the elbow  a crimson spot on her tawny cheek  innumerable necklaces of glass beads on her neck  bizarre things  charms  gifts of witch men  that hung about her  glittered and trembled at every step  she must have had the value of several elephant tusks upon her  she was savage and superb  wild eyed and magnificent  there was something ominous and stately in her deliberate progress  and in the hush that had fallen suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land  the immense wilderness  the colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her  pensive  as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous and passionate soul    she came abreast of the steamer  stood still  and faced us  her long shadow fell to the water own edge  her face had a tragic and fierce aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some struggling  half shaped resolve  she stood looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself  with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose  a whole minute passed  and then she made a step forward  there was a low jingle  a glint of yellow metal  a sway of fringed draperies  and she stopped as if her heart had failed her  the young fellow by my side growled  the pilgrims murmured at my back  she looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving steadiness of her glance  suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw them up rigid above her head  as though in an uncontrollable desire to touch the sky  and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the earth  swept around on the river  gathering the steamer into a shadowy embrace  a formidable silence hung over the scene    she turned away slowly  walked on  following the bank  and passed into the bushes to the left  once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared     if she had offered to come aboard i really think i would have tried to shoot her   said the man of patches  nervously   i had been risking my life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house  she got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags i picked up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with  i was not decent  at least it must have been that  for she talked like a fury to kurtz for an hour  pointing at me now and then  i do not understand the dialect of this tribe  luckily for me  i fancy kurtz felt too ill that day to care  or there would have been mischief  i do not understand        no  it is too much for me  ah  well  it is all over now     at this moment i heard kurtz own deep voice behind the curtain   ownave me   save the ivory  you mean  do not tell me  save  me   why  I have had to save you  you are interrupting my plans now  sick  sick  not so sick as you would like to believe  never mind  I will carry my ideas out yet  i will return  I will show you what can be done  you with your little peddling notions  you are interfering with me  i will return  i          the manager came out  he did me the honor to take me under the arm and lead me aside   he is very low  very low   he said  he considered it necessary to sigh  but neglected to be consistently sorrowful   we have done all we could for him  have not we  but there is no disguising the fact  mr  kurtz has done more harm than good to the company  he did not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action  cautiously  cautiously  that is my principle  we must be cautious yet  the district is closed to us for a time  deplorable  upon the whole  the trade will suffer  i do not deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory  mostly fossil  we must save it  at all events  but look how precarious the position is  and why  because the method is unsound    do you   said i  looking at the shore   call it  unsound method     without doubt   he exclaimed  hotly   do not you          no method at all   i murmured after a while   exactly   he exulted   i anticipated this  shows a complete want of judgment  it is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter    oh   said i   that fellow  what is his name   the brickmaker  will make a readable report for you   he appeared confounded for a moment  it seemed to me i had never breathed an atmosphere so vile  and i turned mentally to kurtz for relief  positively for relief   nevertheless i think mr  kurtz is a remarkable man   i said with emphasis  he started  dropped on me a cold heavy glance  said very quietly   he  was    and turned his back on me  my hour of favor was over  i found myself lumped along with kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe  i was unsound  ah  but it was something to have at least a choice of nightmares    i had turned to the wilderness really  not to mr  kurtz  who  i was ready to admit  was as good as buried  and for a moment it seemed to me as if i also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets  i felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast  the smell of the damp earth  the unseen presence of victorious corruption  the darkness of an impenetrable night        the russian tapped me on the shoulder  i heard him mumbling and stammering something about  brother seaman  could not conceal  knowledge of matters that would affect mr  kurtz own reputation   i waited  for him evidently mr  kurtz was not in his grave  i suspect that for him mr  kurtz was one of the immortals   well   said i at last   ownpeak out  as it happens  i am mr  kurtz own friend  in a way     he stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been  of the same profession   he would have kept the matter to himself without regard to consequences   he suspected there was an active ill will towards him on the part of these white men that     you are right   i said  remembering a certain conversation i had overheard   the manager thinks you ought to be hanged   he showed a concern at this intelligence which amused me at first   i had better get out of the way quietly   he said  earnestly   i can do no more for kurtz now  and they would soon find some excuse  what is to stop them  there is a military post three hundred miles from here    well  upon my word   said i   perhaps you had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by    plenty   he said   they are simple people  and i want nothing  you know   he stood biting his lips  then   i do not want any harm to happen to these whites here  but of course i was thinking of mr  kurtz own reputation  but you are a brother seaman and     right   said i  after a time   mr  kurtz own reputation is safe with me   i did not know how truly i spoke    he informed me  lowering his voice  that it was kurtz who had ordered the attack to be made on the steamer   he hated sometimes the idea of being taken away  and then again        but i do not understand these matters  i am a simple man  he thought it would scare you away  that you would give it up  thinking him dead  i could not stop him  oh  i had an awful time of it this last month    very well   i said   he is all right now    ye e es   he muttered  not very convinced apparently   thanks   said i   i shall keep my eyes open    but quiet  eh   he urged  anxiously   it would be awful for his reputation if anybody here    i promised a complete discretion with great gravity   i have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far  i am off  could you give me a few martini henry cartridges   i could  and did  with proper secrecy  he helped himself  with a wink at me  to a handful of my tobacco   between sailors  you know  good english tobacco   at the door of the pilot house he turned round    i say  have not you a pair of shoes you could spare   he raised one leg   look   the soles were tied with knotted strings sandal wise under his bare feet  i rooted out an old pair  at which he looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm  one of his pockets  bright red  was bulging with cartridges  from the other  dark blue  peeped  towson own inquiry    c    c  he seemed to think himself excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness   ah  I will never  never meet such a man again  you ought to have heard him recite poetry  his own too it was  he told me  poetry   he rolled his eyes at the recollection of these delights   oh  he enlarged my mind    goodby   said i  he shook hands and vanished in the night  sometimes i ask myself whether i had ever really seen him  whether it was possible to meet such a phenomenon          when i woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with its hint of danger that seemed  in the starred darkness  real enough to make me get up for the purpose of having a look round  on the hill a big fire burned  illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the station house  one of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks  armed for the purpose  was keeping guard over the ivory  but deep within the forest  red gleams that wavered  that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness  showed the exact position of the camp where mr  kurtz own adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil  the monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration  a steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black  flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive  and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half awake senses  i believe i dozed off leaning over the rail  till an abrupt burst of yells  an overwhelming outbreak of a pent up and mysterious frenzy  woke me up in a bewildered wonder  it was cut short all at once  and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence  i glanced casually into the little cabin  a light was burning within  but mr  kurtz was not there    i think i would have raised an outcry if i had believed my eyes  but i did not believe them at first  the thing seemed so impossible  the fact is i was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright  pure abstract terror  unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger  what made this emotion so overpowering was  how shall i define it   the moral shock i received  as if something altogether monstrous  intolerable to thought and odious to the soul  had been thrust upon me unexpectedly  this lasted of course the merest fraction of a second  and then the usual sense of commonplace  deadly danger  the possibility of a sudden onslaught and massacre  or something of the kind  which i saw impending  was positively welcome and composing  it pacified me  in fact  so much  that i did not raise an alarm    there was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair on deck within three feet of me  the yells had not awakened him  he snored very slightly  i left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore  i did not betray mr  kurtz  it was ordered i should never betray him  it was written i should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice  i was anxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone   and to this day i do not know why i was so jealous of sharing with anyone the peculiar blackness of that experience    as soon as i got on the bank i saw a trail  a broad trail through the grass  i remember the exultation with which i said to myself   he cannot walk  he is crawling on all fours  I have got him   the grass was wet with dew  i strode rapidly with clenched fists  i fancy i had some vague notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing  i do not know  i had some imbecile thoughts  the knitting old woman with the cat obtruded herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the other end of such an affair  i saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in the air out of winchesters held to the hip  i thought i would never get back to the steamer  and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the woods to an advanced age  such silly things  you know  and i remember i confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart  and was pleased at its calm regularity    i kept to the track though  then stopped to listen  the night was very clear  a dark blue space  sparkling with dew and starlight  in which black things stood very still  i thought i could see a kind of motion ahead of me  i was strangely cocksure of everything that night  i actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle  i verily believe chuckling to myself  so as to get in front of that stir  of that motion i had seen  if indeed i had seen anything  i was circumventing kurtz as though it had been a boyish game    i came upon him  and  if he had not heard me coming  i would have fallen over him too  but he got up in time  he rose  unsteady  long  pale  indistinct  like a vapor exhaled by the earth  and swayed slightly  misty and silent before me  while at my back the fires loomed between the trees  and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest  i had cut him off cleverly  but when actually confronting him i seemed to come to my senses  i saw the danger in its right proportion  it was by no means over yet  suppose he began to shout  though he could hardly stand  there was still plenty of vigor in his voice   go away  hide yourself   he said  in that profound tone  it was very awful  i glanced back  we were within thirty yards from the nearest fire  a black figure stood up  strode on long black legs  waving long black arms  across the glow  it had horns  antelope horns  i think  on its head  some sorcerer  some witch man  no doubt  it looked fiend like enough   do you know what you are doing   i whispered   perfectly   he answered  raising his voice for that single word  it sounded to me far off and yet loud  like a hail through a speaking trumpet   if he makes a row we are lost   i thought to myself  this clearly was not a case for fisticuffs  even apart from the very natural aversion i had to beat that shadow  this wandering and tormented thing   you will be lost   i said   utterly lost   one gets sometimes such a flash of inspiration  you know  i did say the right thing  though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than he was at this very moment  when the foundations of our intimacy were being laid  to endure  to endure  even to the end  even beyond     i had immense plans   he muttered irresolutely   yes   said i   but if you try to shout I will smash your head with    there was not a stick or a stone near   i will throttle you for good   i corrected myself   i was on the threshold of great things   he pleaded  in a voice of longing  with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold   and now for this stupid scoundrel     your success in europe is assured in any case   i affirmed  steadily  i did not want to have the throttling of him  you understand  and indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose  i tried to break the spell  the heavy  mute spell of the wilderness  that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts  by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions  this alone  i was convinced  had driven him out to the edge of the forest  to the bush  towards the gleam of fires  the throb of drums  the drone of weird incantations  this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations  and  do not you see  the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the head  though i had a very lively sense of that danger too  but in this  that i had to deal with a being to whom i could not appeal in the name of anything high or low  i had  even like the niggers  to invoke him  himself his own exalted and incredible degradation  there was nothing either above or below him  and i knew it  he had kicked himself loose of the earth  confound the man  he had kicked the very earth to pieces  he was alone  and i before him did not know whether i stood on the ground or floated in the air  I have been telling you what we said  repeating the phrases we pronounced   but what is the good  they were common everyday words   the familiar  vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life  but what of that  they had behind them  to my mind  the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams  of phrases spoken in nightmares  soul  if anybody had ever struggled with a soul  i am the man  and i was not arguing with a lunatic either  believe me or not  his intelligence was perfectly clear  concentrated  it is true  upon himself with horrible intensity  yet clear  and therein was my only chance  barring  of course  the killing him there and then  which was not so good  on account of unavoidable noise  but his soul was mad  being alone in the wilderness  it had looked within itself  and  by heavens  i tell you  it had gone mad  i had  for my sins  i suppose  to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself  no eloquence could have been so withering to one own belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity  he struggled with himself  too  i saw it   i heard it  i saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint  no faith  and no fear  yet struggling blindly with itself  i kept my head pretty well  but when i had him at last stretched on the couch  i wiped my forehead  while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my back down that hill  and yet i had only supported him  his bony arm clasped round my neck  and he was not much heavier than a child    when next day we left at noon  the crowd  of whose presence behind the curtain of trees i had been acutely conscious all the time  flowed out of the woods again  filled the clearing  covered the slope with a mass of naked  breathing  quivering  bronze bodies  i steamed up a bit  then swung down stream  and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing  thumping  fierce river demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air  in front of the first rank  along the river  three men  plastered with bright red earth from head to foot  strutted to and fro restlessly  when we came abreast again  they faced the river  stamped their feet  nodded their horned heads  swayed their scarlet bodies  they shook towards the fierce river demon a bunch of black feathers  a mangy skin with a pendent tail  something that looked like a dried gourd  they shouted periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language  and the deep murmurs of the crowd  interrupted suddenly  were like the response of some satanic litany    we had carried kurtz into the pilot house  there was more air there  lying on the couch  he stared through the open shutter  there was an eddy in the mass of human bodies  and the woman with helmeted head and tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream  she put out her hands  shouted something  and all that wild mob took up the shout in a roaring chorus of articulated  rapid  breathless utterance     do you understand this   i asked    he kept on looking out past me with fiery  longing eyes  with a mingled expression of wistfulness and hate  he made no answer  but i saw a smile  a smile of indefinable meaning  appear on his colorless lips that a moment after twitched convulsively   do i not   he said slowly  gasping  as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural power    i pulled the string of the whistle  and i did this because i saw the pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a jolly lark  at the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror through that wedged mass of bodies   do not  do not you frighten them away   cried someone on deck disconsolately  i pulled the string time after time  they broke and ran  they leaped  they crouched  they swerved  they dodged the flying terror of the sound  the three red chaps had fallen flat  face down on the shore  as though they had been shot dead  only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch  and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the somber and glittering river    and then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun  and i could see nothing more for smoke    the brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness  bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress  and kurtz own life was running swiftly too  ebbing  ebbing out of his heart into the sea of inexorable time  the manager was very placid  he had no vital anxieties now  he took us both in with a comprehensive and satisfied glance  the  affair  had come off as well as could be wished  i saw the time approaching when i would be left alone of the party of  unsound method   the pilgrims looked upon me with disfavor  i was  so to speak  numbered with the dead  it is strange how i accepted this unforeseen partnership  this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms    kurtz discoursed  a voice  a voice  it rang deep to the very last  it survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the barren darkness of his heart  oh  he struggled  he struggled  the wastes of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now  images of wealth and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble and lofty expression  my intended  my station  my career  my ideas  these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated sentiments  the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of the hollow sham  whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mold of primeval earth  but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that soul satiated with primitive emotions  avid of lying fame  of sham distinction  of all the appearances of success and power    sometimes he was contemptibly childish  he desired to have kings meet him at railway stations on his return from some ghastly nowhere  where he intended to accomplish great things   you show them you have in you something that is really profitable  and then there will be no limits to the recognition of your ability   he would say   of course you must take care of the motives  right motives  always   the long reaches that were like one and the same reach  monotonous bends that were exactly alike  slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking patiently after this grimy fragment of another world  the forerunner of change  of conquest  of trade  of massacres  of blessings  i looked ahead  piloting   close the shutter   said kurtz suddenly one day   i cannot bear to look at this   i did so  there was a silence   oh  but i will wring your heart yet   he cried at the invisible wilderness    we broke down  as i had expected  and had to lie up for repairs at the head of an island  this delay was the first thing that shook kurtz own confidence  one morning he gave me a packet of papers and a photograph   the lot tied together with a shoe string   keep this for me   he said   this noxious fool   meaning the manager   is capable of prying into my boxes when i am not looking   in the afternoon i saw him  he was lying on his back with closed eyes  and i withdrew quietly  but i heard him mutter   live rightly  die  die        i listened  there was nothing more  was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep  or was it a fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article  he had been writing for the papers and meant to do so again   for the furthering of my ideas  it is a duty     his was an impenetrable darkness  i looked at him as you peer down at a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never shines  but i had not much time to give him  because i was helping the engine driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders  to straighten a bent connecting rod  and in other such matters  i lived in an infernal mess of rust  filings  nuts  bolts  spanners  hammers  ratchet drills  things i abominate  because i do not get on with them  i tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard  i toiled wearily in a wretched scrap heap  unless i had the shakes too bad to stand    one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a little tremulously   i am lying here in the dark waiting for death   the light was within a foot of his eyes  i forced myself to murmur   oh  nonsense   and stood over him as if transfixed    anything approaching the change that came over his features i have never seen before  and hope never to see again  oh  i was not touched  i was fascinated  it was as though a veil had been rent  i saw on that ivory face the expression of somber pride  of ruthless power  of craven terror  of an intense and hopeless despair  did he live his life again in every detail of desire  temptation  and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge  he cried in a whisper at some image  at some vision   he cried out twice  a cry that was no more than a breath     the horror  the horror     i blew the candle out and left the cabin  the pilgrims were dining in the mess room  and i took my place opposite the manager  who lifted his eyes to give me a questioning glance  which i successfully ignored  he leaned back  serene  with that peculiar smile of his sealing the unexpressed depths of his meanness  a continuous shower of small flies streamed upon the lamp  upon the cloth  upon our hands and faces  suddenly the manager own boy put his insolent black head in the doorway  and said in a tone of scathing contempt     mistah kurtz  he dead     all the pilgrims rushed out to see  i remained  and went on with my dinner  i believe i was considered brutally callous  however  i did not eat much  there was a lamp in there  light  do not you know  and outside it was so beastly  beastly dark  i went no more near the remarkable man who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this earth  the voice was gone  what else had been there  but i am of course aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole    and then they very nearly buried me    however  as you see  i did not go to join kurtz there and then  i did not  i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end  and to show my loyalty to kurtz once more  destiny  my destiny  droll thing life is  that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose  the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself  that comes too late  a crop of unextinguishable regrets  i have wrestled with death  it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine  it takes place in an impalpable grayness  with nothing underfoot  with nothing around  without spectators  without clamor  without glory  without the great desire of victory  without the great fear of defeat  in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism  without much belief in your own right  and still less in that of your adversary  if such is the form of ultimate wisdom  then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be  i was within a hair own breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement  and i found with humiliation that probably i would have nothing to say  this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a remarkable man  he had something to say  he said it  since i had peeped over the edge myself  i understand better the meaning of his stare  that could not see the flame of the candle  but was wide enough to embrace the whole universe  piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that beat in the darkness  he had summed up  he had judged   the horror   he was a remarkable man  after all  this was the expression of some sort of belief  it had candor  it had conviction  it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper  it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth  the strange commingling of desire and hate  and it is not my own extremity i remember best  a vision of grayness without form filled with physical pain  and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all things  even of this pain itself  no  it is his extremity that i seem to have lived through  true  he had made that last stride  he had stepped over the edge  while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot  and perhaps in this is the whole difference  perhaps all the wisdom  and all truth  and all sincerity  are just compressed into that inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the invisible  perhaps  i like to think my summing up would not have been a word of careless contempt  better his cry  much better  it was an affirmation  a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats  by abominable terrors  by abominable satisfactions  but it was a victory  that is why i have remained loyal to kurtz to the last  and even beyond  when a long time after i heard once more  not his own voice  but the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as translucently pure as a cliff of crystal    no  they did not bury me  though there is a period of time which i remember mistily  with a shuddering wonder  like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire  i found myself back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying through the streets to filch a little money from each other  to devour their infamous cookery  to gulp their unwholesome beer  to dream their insignificant and silly dreams  they trespassed upon my thoughts  they were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense  because i felt so sure they could not possibly know the things i knew  their bearing  which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety  was offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of a danger it is unable to comprehend  i had no particular desire to enlighten them  but i had some difficulty in restraining myself from laughing in their faces  so full of stupid importance  i dare say i was not very well at that time  i tottered about the streets  there were various affairs to settle  grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable persons  i admit my behavior was inexcusable  but then my temperature was seldom normal in these days  my dear aunt own endeavors to  nurse up my strength  seemed altogether beside the mark  it was not my strength that wanted nursing  it was my imagination that wanted soothing  i kept the bundle of papers given me by kurtz  not knowing exactly what to do with it  his mother had died lately  watched over  as i was told  by his intended  a clean shaved man  with an official manner and wearing gold rimmed spectacles  called on me one day and made inquiries  at first circuitous  afterwards suavely pressing  about what he was pleased to denominate certain  documents   i was not surprised  because i had had two rows with the manager on the subject out there  i had refused to give up the smallest scrap out of that package  and i took the same attitude with the spectacled man  he became darkly menacing at last  and with much heat argued that the company had the right to every bit of information about its  territories   and  said he   mr  kurtz own knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive and peculiar  owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable circumstances in which he had been placed  therefore   i assured him mr  kurtz own knowledge  however extensive  did not bear upon the problems of commerce or administration  he invoked then the name of science   it would be an incalculable loss if    c    c  i offered him the report on the  ownuppression of savage customs   with the postscriptum torn off  he took it up eagerly  but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt   this is not what we had a right to expect   he remarked   expect nothing else   i said   there are only private letters   he withdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings  and i saw him no more  but another fellow  calling himself kurtz own cousin  appeared two days later  and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative own last moments  incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been essentially a great musician   there was the making of an immense success   said the man  who was an organist  i believe  with lank gray hair flowing over a greasy coat collar  i had no reason to doubt his statement  and to this day i am unable to say what was kurtz own profession  whether he ever had any  which was the greatest of his talents  i had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers  or else for a journalist who could paint  but even the cousin  who took snuff during the interview  could not tell me what he had been  exactly  he was a universal genius  on that point i agreed with the old chap  who thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and withdrew in senile agitation  bearing off some family letters and memoranda without importance  ultimately a journalist anxious to know something of the fate of his  dear colleague  turned up  this visitor informed me kurtz own proper sphere ought to have been politics  on the popular side   he had furry straight eyebrows  bristly hair cropped short  an eye glass on a broad ribbon  and  becoming expansive  confessed his opinion that kurtz really could not write a bit   but heavens  how that man could talk  he electrified large meetings  he had faith  do not you see   he had the faith  he could get himself to believe anything  anything  he would have been a splendid leader of an extreme party    what party   i asked   any party   answered the other   he was an  an  extremist   did i not think so  i assented  did i know  he asked  with a sudden flash of curiosity   what it was that had induced him to go out there    yes   said i  and forthwith handed him the famous report for publication  if he thought fit  he glanced through it hurriedly  mumbling all the time  judged  it would do   and took himself off with this plunder    thus i was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl own portrait  she struck me as beautiful  i mean she had a beautiful expression  i know that the sunlight can be made to lie too  yet one felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features  she seemed ready to listen without mental reservation  without suspicion  without a thought for herself  i concluded i would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself  curiosity  yes  and also some other feeling perhaps  all that had been kurtz own had passed out of my hands  his soul  his body  his station  his plans  his ivory  his career  there remained only his memory and his intended  and i wanted to give that up too to the past  in a way   to surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate  i do not defend myself  i had no clear perception of what it was i really wanted  perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty  or the fulfillment of one of these ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence  i do not know  i cannot tell  but i went    i thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that accumulate in every man own life   a vague impress on the brain of shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage  but before the high and ponderous door  between the tall houses of a street as still and decorous as a well kept alley in a cemetery  i had a vision of him on the stretcher  opening his mouth voraciously  as if to devour all the earth with all its mankind  he lived then before me  he lived as much as he had ever lived  a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances  of frightful realities  a shadow darker than the shadow of the night  and draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence  the vision seemed to enter the house with me  the stretcher  the phantom bearers  the wild crowd of obedient worshipers  the gloom of the forests  the glitter of the reach between the murky bends  the beat of the drum  regular and muffled like the beating of a heart  the heart of a conquering darkness  it was a moment of triumph for the wilderness  an invading and vengeful rush which  it seemed to me  i would have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul  and the memory of what i had heard him say afar there  with the horned shapes stirring at my back  in the glow of fires  within the patient woods  those broken phrases came back to me  were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity  i remembered his abject pleading  his abject threats  the colossal scale of his vile desires  the meanness  the torment  the tempestuous anguish of his soul  and later on i seemed to see his collected languid manner  when he said one day   this lot of ivory now is really mine  the company did not pay for it  i collected it myself at a very great personal risk  i am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though  h m  it is a difficult case  what do you think i ought to do  resist  eh  i want no more than justice         he wanted no more than justice  no more than justice  i rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor  and while i waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel  stare with that wide and immense stare embracing  condemning  loathing all the universe  i seemed to hear the whispered cry   the horror  the horror     the dusk was falling  i had to wait in a lofty drawing room with three long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and bedraped columns  the bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in indistinct curves  the tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental whiteness  a grand piano stood massively in a corner  with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a somber and polished sarcophagus  a high door opened  closed  i rose    she came forward  all in black  with a pale head  floating towards me in the dusk  she was in mourning  it was more than a year since his death  more than a year since the news came  she seemed as though she would remember and mourn for ever  she took both my hands in hers and murmured   i had heard you were coming   i noticed she was not very young  i mean not girlish  she had a mature capacity for fidelity  for belief  for suffering  the room seemed to have grown darker  as if all the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead  this fair hair  this pale visage  this pure brow  seemed surrounded by an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me  their glance was guileless  profound  confident  and trustful  she carried her sorrowful head as though she were proud of that sorrow  as though she would say   i  i alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves   but while we were still shaking hands  such a look of awful desolation came upon her face that i perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the playthings of time  for her he had died only yesterday  and  by jove  the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died only yesterday  nay  this very minute  i saw her and him in the same instant of time  his death and her sorrow  i saw her sorrow in the very moment of his death  do you understand  i saw them together  i heard them together  she had said  with a deep catch of the breath   i have survived   while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly  mingled with her tone of despairing regret  the summing up whisper of his eternal condemnation  i asked myself what i was doing there  with a sensation of panic in my heart as though i had blundered into a place of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold  she motioned me to a chair  we sat down  i laid the packet gently on the little table  and she put her hand over it         you knew him well   she murmured  after a moment of mourning silence     intimacy grows quick out there   i said   i knew him as well as it is possible for one man to know another      and you admired him   she said   it was impossible to know him and not to admire him  was it      he was a remarkable man   i said  unsteadily  then before the appealing fixity of her gaze  that seemed to watch for more words on my lips  i went on   it was impossible not to       love him   she finished eagerly  silencing me into an appalled dumbness   how true  how true  but when you think that no one knew him so well as i  i had all his noble confidence  i knew him best      you knew him best   i repeated  and perhaps she did  but with every word spoken the room was growing darker  and only her forehead  smooth and white  remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief and love     you were his friend   she went on   his friend   she repeated  a little louder   you must have been  if he had given you this  and sent you to me  i feel i can speak to you  and oh  i must speak  i want you  you who have heard his last words  to know i have been worthy of him        it is not pride        yes  i am proud to know i understood him better than anyone on earth  he told me so himself  and since his mother died i have had no one  no one  to  to      i listened  the darkness deepened  i was not even sure whether he had given me the right bundle  i rather suspect he wanted me to take care of another batch of his papers which  after his death  i saw the manager examining under the lamp  and the girl talked  easing her pain in the certitude of my sympathy  she talked as thirsty men drink  i had heard that her engagement with kurtz had been disapproved by her people  he was not rich enough or something  and indeed i do not know whether he had not been a pauper all his life  he had given me some reason to infer that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out there           who was not his friend who had heard him speak once   she was saying   he drew men towards him by what was best in them   she looked at me with intensity   it is the gift of the great   she went on  and the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all the other sounds  full of mystery  desolation  and sorrow  i had ever heard  the ripple of the river  the soughing of the trees swayed by the wind  the murmurs of wild crowds  the faint ring of incomprehensible words cried from afar  the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the threshold of an eternal darkness   but you have heard him  you know   she cried     yes  i know   i said with something like despair in my heart  but bowing my head before the faith that was in her  before that great and saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness  in the triumphant darkness from which i could not have defended her  from which i could not even defend myself     what a loss to me  to us    she corrected herself with beautiful generosity  then added in a murmur   to the world   by the last gleams of twilight i could see the glitter of her eyes  full of tears  of tears that would not fall     i have been very happy  very fortunate  very proud   she went on   too fortunate  too happy for a little while  and now i am unhappy for  for life     she stood up  her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in a glimmer of gold  i rose too     and of all this   she went on  mournfully   of all his promise  and of all his greatness  of his generous mind  of his noble heart  nothing remains  nothing but a memory  you and i       we shall always remember him   i said  hastily     no   she cried   it is impossible that all this should be lost  that such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing  but sorrow  you know what vast plans he had  i knew of them too  i could not perhaps understand   but others knew of them  something must remain  his words  at least  have not died      his words will remain   i said     and his example   she whispered to herself   men looked up to him   his goodness shone in every act  his example       true   i said   his example too  yes  his example  i forgot that      but i do not  i cannot  i cannot believe  not yet  i cannot believe that i shall never see him again  that nobody will see him again  never  never  never     she put out her arms as if after a retreating figure  stretching them black and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of the window  never see him  i saw him clearly enough then  i shall see this eloquent phantom as long as i live  and i shall see her too  a tragic and familiar shade  resembling in this gesture another one  tragic also  and bedecked with powerless charms  stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream  the stream of darkness  she said suddenly very low   he died as he lived      his end   said i  with dull anger stirring in me   was in every way worthy of his life      and i was not with him   she murmured  my anger subsided before a feeling of infinite pity     everything that could be done    i mumbled     ah  but i believed in him more than anyone on earth  more than his own mother  more than  himself  he needed me  me  i would have treasured every sigh  every word  every sign  every glance     i felt like a chill grip on my chest   do not   i said  in a muffled voice     forgive me  i  i  have mourned so long in silence  in silence        you were with him  to the last  i think of his loneliness  nobody near to understand him as i would have understood  perhaps no one to hear            to the very end   i said  shakily   i heard his very last words         i stopped in a fright     repeat them   she said in a heart broken tone   i want  i want  something  something  to  to live with     i was on the point of crying at her   do not you hear them   the dusk was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us  in a whisper that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind   the horror  the horror      his last word  to live with   she murmured   do not you understand i loved him  i loved him  i loved him     i pulled myself together and spoke slowly     the last word he pronounced was  your name     i heard a light sigh  and then my heart stood still  stopped dead short by an exulting and terrible cry  by the cry of inconceivable triumph and of unspeakable pain   i knew it  i was sure         she knew  she was sure  i heard her weeping  she had hidden her face in her hands  it seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape  that the heavens would fall upon my head  but nothing happened  the heavens do not fall for such a trifle  would they have fallen  i wonder  if i had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due  had not he said he wanted only justice  but i could not  i could not tell her  it would have been too dark  too dark altogether          marlow ceased  and sat apart  indistinct and silent  in the pose of a meditating buddha  nobody moved for a time   we have lost the first of the ebb   said the director  suddenly  i raised my head  the offing was barred by a black bank of clouds  and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under an overcast sky  seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
