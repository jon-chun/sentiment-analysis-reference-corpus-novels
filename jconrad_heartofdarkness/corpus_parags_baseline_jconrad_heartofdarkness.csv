sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,

idol. The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the

rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the

5,5,0,"Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled
and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from
the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be
visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,
to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never
returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from
Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;
kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the
dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals""
of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all
had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,
messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the

could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a
seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home
order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.
For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not

10,10,0,"""was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here,
nineteen hundred years ago--the other day. . . . Light came out of this
river since--you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on
a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the
flicker--may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But
darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of
a fine--what d'ye call 'em?--trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered
suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in
charge of one of these craft the legionaries,--a wonderful lot of handy
men they must have been too--used to build, apparently by the hundred,
in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here--the
very end of the world, a sea the color of lead, a sky the color of
smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina--and going up this
river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sandbanks, marshes,
forests, savages,--precious little to eat fit for a civilized man,
nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going
ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a
needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and
death,--death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must
have been dying like flies here. Oh yes--he did it. Did it very well,
too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except
afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps.
They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered
by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna
by-and-by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful
climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too
much dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or
tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,
march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the
utter savagery, had closed round him,--all that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of
wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And

more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,
two black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise
me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that
Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people
watched him, thunderstruck, till some man,--was told the chief's
son,--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,
the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of
the engineer, believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about Fresleven's remains, till got out and stepped into his shoes. couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped
black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity
had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had
scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had
never returned. What became of the hens don't know either. should

ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It
was just as though had been let into some conspiracy--don't
know--something not quite right; and was glad to get out. In the outer
room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving,
and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The
old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on
a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched
white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed
spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the
glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.
Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over,
and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She
seemed to know all about them and about me too. An eerie feeling came
over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there thought
of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for
a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown,

the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows.
Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some

the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead,--came from
somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with
ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and
billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a

his feet in slippers, and thought him a harmless fool. 'always ask

have out there, for, as far as could see, the sole purpose of landing
soldiers and custom-house officers. watched the coast. Watching a
coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There
it is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or
savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, 'Come and find out.'
This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with
an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so
dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight,
like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was
blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to
glisten and drip with steam. Here and there grayish-whitish specks
showed up, clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above
them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than
pin-heads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded
along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to
levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed
and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the
custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, heard, got drowned in the surf;
but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They
were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast
looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various
places--trading places--with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo, names
that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister
backcloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these
men with whom had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the
uniform somberness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth
of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The
voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the
speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that
had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary
contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see
from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang;
their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque
masks--these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an
intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf
along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a
great comfort to look at. For a time would feel belonged still to
a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long.
Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, remember, we came upon
a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn't even a shed there, and
she was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars
going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles
of the long eight-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy,
slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin
masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was,
incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the
eight-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little
white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble
screech--and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch
of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the
sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me
earnestly there was a camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden
out of sight somewhere.", left in a french steamer  and she called in every blamed port they have out there  for  as far as could see  the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom house officers  watched the coast  watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma  there it is before you  smiling  frowning  inviting  grand  mean  insipid  or savage  and always mute with an air of whispering   come and find out   this one was almost featureless  as if still in the making  with an aspect of monotonous grimness  the edge of a colossal jungle  so dark green as to be almost black  fringed with white surf  ran straight  like a ruled line  far  far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist  the sun was fierce  the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam  here and there grayish whitish specks showed up  clustered inside the white surf  with a flag flying above them perhaps  settlements some centuries old  and still no bigger than pin heads on the untouched expanse of their background  we pounded along  stopped  landed soldiers  went on  landed custom house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a god forsaken wilderness  with a tin she would and a flag pole lost in it  landed more soldiers  to take care of the custom house clerks  presumably  some  heard  got drowned in the surf  but whether they did or not  nobody seemed particularly to care  they were just flung out there  and on we went  every day the coast looked the same  as though we had not moved  but we passed various places  trading places  with names like gran  bassam little popo  names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister backcloth  the idleness of a passenger  my isolation amongst all these men with whom had no point of contact  the oily and languid sea  the uniform somberness of the coast  seemed to keep me away from the truth of things  within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion  the voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure  like the speech of a brother  it was something natural  that had its reason  that had a meaning  now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality  it was paddled by black fellows  you could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening  they shouted  sang  their bodies streamed with perspiration  they had faces like grotesque masks  these chaps  but they had bone  muscle  a wild vitality  an intense energy of movement  that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast  they wanted no excuse for being there  they were a great comfort to look at  for a time would feel belonged still to a world of straightforward facts  but the feeling would not last long  something would turn up to scare it away  once  remember  we came upon a man of war anchored off the coast  there was not even a she would there  and she was shelling the bush  it appears the french had one of their wars going on thereabouts  her ensign dropped limp like a rag  the muzzles of the long eight inch guns stuck out all over the low hull  the greasy  slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down  swaying her thin masts  in the empty immensity of earth  sky  and water  there she was  incomprehensible  firing into a continent  pop  would go one of the eight inch guns  a small flame would dart and vanish  a little white smoke would disappear  a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech  and nothing happened  nothing could happen  there was a touch of insanity in the proceeding  a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight  and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives  he called them enemies   hidden out of sight somewhere ,3705,646,-2.2,-0.2302683292285453,-0.3823529411764707,-0.2302683292285453,0.03042900138253299,-1.7,-0.12855992517246384,-0.19387755102040824,-0.12855992517246384,0.08196123804522648,-199.84587725727536,-1.9566367906707338,-1.8053206992048305,-1.9566367906707338,-0.24490557115068812,-7.577678571428572,-3.097689710597364,-3.306672148518233,-3.097689710597364,-0.6386018431882861,-17.917999999999992,-3.0401561246545397,-3.257732831210595,-3.0401561246545397,-0.9697663421120216,24.23392906043462,0.6930231688886821,0.5472145750803281,0.6930231688886821,0.1138645496999446,0.7569124201590904,0.47851960845245106,0.40997787417000614,0.47851960845245106,0.0908047270047339,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.786, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': -0.6757}",-0.6757,-0.9043858913155853,-0.43590736081543124,-0.9043858913155853,-0.12924084266719754,-0.012711202938475667,-0.3699310714381214,-0.3370509332692653,-0.3699310714381214,-0.19514534081858406,-0.1188062947563255,-0.8341804443978367,-0.5746643196554321,-0.8341804443978367,-0.4472454624854976,99.30690952487267,2.0882608254978856,2.3919419013857963,2.0882608254978856,-0.782162186925073,-0.9515,-0.5699093952132117,0.07317209406244778,-0.5699093952132117,0.29194317201351183

stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through

solitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long

his long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above.

of rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their
loads in the night--quite a mutiny. So, one evening, made a speech in
English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of
eyes before me, and the next morning started the hammock off in front

stupid--when think of it--to be altogether natural. Still. . . . But
at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The
steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry
up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer
skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom
out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. asked myself
what was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, had

52,52,0,"""My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to
sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in
complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle
size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps
remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as
trenchant and heavy as an ax. But even at these times the rest of his
person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only
an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy--a
smile--not a smile--remember it, but can't explain. It was
unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it
got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like
a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase
appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth
up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired
neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That
was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just uneasiness--nothing
more. You have no idea how effective such a . . . a . . . faculty can
be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even.
That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station.
He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to
him--why? Perhaps because he was never ill . . . He had served three
terms of three years out there . . . Because triumphant health in the
general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went
home on leave he rioted on a large scale--pompously. Jack ashore--with
a difference--in externals only. This one could gather from his casual
talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going--that's
all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was
impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that
secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion
made one pause--for out there there were no external checks. Once when
various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the
station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out here should have no
entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though
it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping.
You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When annoyed at
meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence,
he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house
had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where he sat was the
first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable
conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed
his 'boy'--an overfed young negro from the coast--to treat the white
men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.", my first interview with the manager was curious  he did not ask me to sit down after my twenty mile walk that morning  he was commonplace in complexion  in features  in manners  and in voice  he was of middle size and of ordinary build  his eyes  of the usual blue  were perhaps remarkably cold  and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an ax  but even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention  otherwise there was only an indefinable  faint expression of his lips  something stealthy  a smile  not a smile  remember it  but cannot explain  it was unconscious  this smile was  though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant  it came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable  he was a common trader  from his youth up employed in these parts  nothing more  he was obeyed  yet he inspired neither love nor fear  nor even respect  he inspired uneasiness  that was it  uneasiness  not a definite mistrust  just uneasiness  nothing more  you have no idea how effective such a       a       faculty can be  he had no genius for organizing  for initiative  or for order even  that was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station  he had no learning  and no intelligence  his position had come to him  why  perhaps because he was never ill       he had served three terms of three years out there       because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself  when he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale  pompously  jack ashore  with a difference  in externals only  this one could gather from his casual talk  he originated nothing  he could keep the routine going  that is all  but he was great  he was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man  he never gave that secret away  perhaps there was nothing within him  such a suspicion made one pause  for out there there were no external checks  once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every  agent  in the station  he was heard to say   men who come out here should have no entrails   he sealed the utterance with that smile of his  as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping  you fancied you had seen things  but the seal was on  when annoyed at meal times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence  he ordered an immense round table to be made  for which a special house had to be built  this was the station own mess room  where he sat was the first place  the rest were nowhere  one felt this to be his unalterable conviction  he was neither civil nor uncivil  he was quiet  he allowed his  boy   an overfed young negro from the coast  to treat the white men  under his very eyes  with provoking insolence ,2911,516,1.8499999999999992,0.6206633445427471,0.5705882352941174,0.6206633445427471,0.2127217982058196,3.3499999999999996,0.9598995937093873,0.8367346938775512,0.9598995937093873,0.3311480756369651,-68.83830156679265,-0.44316424300292867,-0.5033958260942895,-0.44316424300292867,-0.021079257388025793,-2.349055555555557,-0.9706725868230482,-1.0381549093088438,-0.9706725868230482,-0.256276881107173,4.195000000000003,0.1623482762832387,0.4849997884314309,0.1623482762832387,-0.09295317728427727,86.08287009857101,2.2853455320569838,1.943795455751813,2.2853455320569838,0.5063656715310357,2.5143797920144126,1.4798805002935447,1.3619013964249993,1.4798805002935447,0.377638722194633,"{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.8002}",0.8002,1.1448895471488572,0.516224759692923,1.1448895471488572,0.1916139949248161,0.030476874657909138,-0.12497621267705031,-0.06711612880977762,-0.12497621267705031,-0.11715603495688239,0.3535019836669171,0.3348010812382071,0.4501488097818569,0.3348010812382071,-0.12916450766238055,82.03164071447021,1.5338961059359677,1.833861305116802,1.5338961059359677,-0.6992820046286078,-0.9992,-0.6297020012837189,-0.03340222309110185,-0.6297020012837189,0.23999149846255102

a stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation

exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore
could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.'

a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame
had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and
collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A
nigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in
some way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. saw him,
later on, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick
and trying to recover himself: afterwards he arose and went out--and
the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As approached the glow from the dark found myself at the back of two men,
talking. heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, 'take
advantage of this unfortunate accident.' One of the men was the manager.
wished him a good evening. 'Did you ever see anything like it--eh? it
is incredible,' he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was
a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked
little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other
agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's spy upon them.
As to me, had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and
by-and-by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to
his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck
a match, and perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a
silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself.
Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any
right to candles. Native mats covered the clay walls; a collection of
spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies. The business
intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks--so had been
informed; but there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the
station, and he had been there more than a year--waiting. It seems he
could not make bricks without something, don't know what--straw maybe.
Anyways, it could not be found there, and as it was not likely to be
sent from Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for.
An act of special creation perhaps. However, they were all waiting--all
the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them--for something; and upon my word
it did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it,
though the only thing that ever came to them was disease--as far as could see. They beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against
each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about
that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as
everything else--as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern, as
their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real
feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory
was to be had, so that they could earn percentages. They intrigued
and slandered and hated each other only on that account,--but as to
effectually lifting a little finger--oh, no. By heavens! there is
something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while
another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very
well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking
at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a
kick.", strolled up  there was no hurry  you see the thing had gone off like a box of matches  it had been hopeless from the very first  the flame had leaped high  driven everybody back  lighted up everything  and collapsed  the she would was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely  a nigger was being beaten near by  they said he had caused the fire in some way  be that as it may  he was screeching most horribly  saw him  later on  for several days  sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself  afterwards he arose and went out  and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again  as approached the glow from the dark found myself at the back of two men  talking  heard the name of kurtz pronounced  then the words   take advantage of this unfortunate accident   one of the men was the manager  wished him a good evening   did you ever see anything like it  eh  it is incredible   he said  and walked off  the other man remained  he was a first class agent  young  gentlemanly  a bit reserved  with a forked little beard and a hooked nose  he was stand offish with the other agents  and they on their side said he was the manager own spy upon them  as to me  had hardly ever spoken to him before  we got into talk  and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins  then he asked me to his room  which was in the main building of the station  he struck a match  and perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver mounted dressing case but also a whole candle all to himself  just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles  native mats covered the clay walls  a collection of spears  assegais  shields  knives was hung up in trophies  the business intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks  so had been informed  but there was not a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station  and he had been there more than a year  waiting  it seems he could not make bricks without something  do not know what  straw maybe  anyways  it could not be found there  and as it was not likely to be sent from europe  it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for  an act of special creation perhaps  however  they were all waiting  all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them  for something  and upon my word it did not seem an uncongenial occupation  from the way they took it  though the only thing that ever came to them was disease  as far as could see  they beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way  there was an air of plotting about that station  but nothing came of it  of course  it was as unreal as everything else  as the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern  as their talk  as their government  as their show of work  the only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading post where ivory was to be had  so that they could earn percentages  they intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account   but as to effectually lifting a little finger  oh  no  by heavens  there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter  steal a horse straight out  very well  he has done it  perhaps he can ride  but there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick ,3340,605,-0.5999999999999999,0.10590220855764439,-0.005882352941176476,0.10590220855764439,0.09337206419104148,1.6500000000000001,0.5934874784422295,0.48979591836734704,0.5934874784422295,0.22832035911948592,-13.436272799781777,0.1968708784932122,0.04717751970190437,0.1968708784932122,0.12037588479776012,0.7535047619047632,0.291456830950423,0.30793784675315244,0.291456830950423,0.05255105359989176,8.149000000000003,0.7349843908451695,1.1542334870731608,0.7349843908451695,0.03758051221537821,6.081785356008022,0.22568995550058588,0.13732983954100944,0.22568995550058588,0.030512158564003952,-2.4455333238920165,-1.3461537696657295,-1.324611046982721,-1.3461537696657295,-0.31326621073961375,"{'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': -0.9501}",-0.9501,-1.285388113901562,-0.6129281981807625,-1.285388113901562,-0.19404047251468737,0.07855685131195338,0.14772460074171753,0.23339410037468988,0.14772460074171753,-0.047048978291897456,0.6801308190807461,1.1432202679894177,1.1588671072937704,1.1432202679894177,0.03156184719866123,94.45872463532913,1.9326821953663689,2.2353204361180876,1.9326821953663689,-0.7442082100176889,-0.9998,-0.6304541095361781,-0.034742780539574275,-0.6304541095361781,0.2718078346466004

the other followed me. heard a scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap

discussing. Several had still their staves in their hands. verily

forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through the dim stir,
through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of
the land went home to one's very heart,--its mystery, its greatness,
the amazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned feebly
somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my

61,61,0,"""let him run on, this _papier-mache_ Mephistopheles, and it seemed to
me that if tried could poke my forefinger through him, and would find
nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don't you see, had
been planning to be assistant-manager by-and-by under the present man,
and could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a
little. He talked precipitately, and did not try to stop him. had my
shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a
carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud,
by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was
before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon
had spread over everything a thin layer of silver--over the rank grass,
over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than
the wall of a temple, over the great river could see through a somber
gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur.
All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about
himself. wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity
looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we
who had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it
handle us? felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that
couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? could
see a little ivory coming out from there, and had heard Mr. Kurtz was
in there. had heard enough about it too--God knows! Yet somehow it
didn't bring any image with it--no more than if had been told an angel
or a fiend was in there. believed it in the same way one of you might
believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. knew once a Scotch
sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you
asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy
and mutter something about 'walking on all-fours.' If you as much as
smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to fight you. would not
have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but went for him near enough
to a lie. You know hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because
am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me.
There is a taint of death, a flavor of mortality in lies,--which is
exactly what hate and detest in the world--what want to forget.
It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do.
Temperament, suppose. Well, went near enough to it by letting the
young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence
in Europe. became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of
the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because had a notion it somehow
would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time did not see--you
understand. He was just a word for me. did not see the man in the name
any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see
anything? It seems to me am trying to tell you a dream--making a vain
attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation,
that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of
struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which
is of the very essence of dreams. . . .""", let him run on  this  papier mache  mephistopheles  and it seemed to me that if tried could poke my forefinger through him  and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt  maybe  he  do not you see  had been planning to be assistant manager by and by under the present man  and could see that the coming of that kurtz had upset them both not a little  he talked precipitately  and did not try to stop him  had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer  hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal  the smell of mud  of primeval mud  by jove  was in my nostrils  the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes  there were shiny patches on the black creek  the moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver  over the rank grass  over the mud  upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple  over the great river could see through a somber gap glittering  glittering  as it flowed broadly by without a murmur  all this was great  expectant  mute  while the man jabbered about himself  wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace  what were we who had strayed in here  could we handle that dumb thing  or would it handle us  felt how big  how confoundedly big  was that thing that could not talk  and perhaps was deaf as well  what was in there  could see a little ivory coming out from there  and had heard mr  kurtz was in there  had heard enough about it too  god knows  yet somehow it did not bring any image with it  no more than if had been told an angel or a fiend was in there  believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet mars  knew once a scotch sailmaker who was certain  dead sure  there were people in mars  if you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved  he would get shy and mutter something about  walking on all fours   if you as much as smiled  he would  though a man of sixty  offer to fight you  would not have gone so far as to fight for kurtz  but went for him near enough to a lie  you know hate  detest  and cannot bear a lie  not because am straighter than the rest of us  but simply because it appalls me  there is a taint of death  a flavor of mortality in lies   which is exactly what hate and detest in the world  what want to forget  it makes me miserable and sick  like biting something rotten would do  temperament  suppose  well  went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in europe  became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims  this simply because had a notion it somehow would be of help to that kurtz whom at the time did not see  you understand  he was just a word for me  did not see the man in the name any more than you do  do you see him  do you see the story  do you see anything  it seems to me am trying to tell you a dream  making a vain attempt  because no relation of a dream can convey the dream sensation  that commingling of absurdity  surprise  and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt  that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams        ,3246,605,-12.799999999999999,-2.4573981420620514,-2.876470588235294,-2.4573981420620514,-0.4324567110966594,-12.0,-2.348586270614655,-2.2959183673469394,-2.348586270614655,-0.38788480403975417,-201.891875518816,-1.9802733031784814,-1.8256533861735138,-1.9802733031784814,-0.27587672797505425,-9.720050000000002,-3.969211849451627,-4.236172421104336,-3.969211849451627,-0.8695635807708401,3.401000000000002,0.04735761493721602,0.350611433165489,0.04735761493721602,-0.1542736095129777,-115.64409255676239,-2.908184842085425,-2.6113030541265414,-2.908184842085425,-0.5801833972316252,-3.6755024592889796,-2.0469593778278328,-1.9908177546474999,-2.0469593778278328,-0.470821933496757,"{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': -0.9908}",-0.9908,-1.3418997409396425,-0.6391845687375008,-1.3418997409396425,-0.2023526998921716,0.0016513694638694602,-0.2884691937611069,-0.24728175647944678,-0.2884691937611069,-0.17295277754121371,0.11513083123242081,-0.25517687631687014,-0.06706822378252394,-0.25517687631687014,-0.31027189824203394,93.87845864767269,1.9140614146972552,2.2165748413641047,1.9140614146972552,-0.7593489847983793,-0.9994,-0.6299527040345386,-0.033849075573925906,-0.6299527040345386,0.27188193700577756

his legs dangling over the mud. You see rather chummed with the few
mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally
despised--on account of their imperfect manners, suppose. This was the
foreman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good worker. He was a lank, bony,
yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his
head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed
to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality,
for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young
children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out
there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an
enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work
hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his

74,74,1,"""One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard
voices approaching--and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling
along the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost
myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: 'I am as
harmless as a little child, but I don't like to be dictated to. Am I the
manager--or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It's incredible.'
. . . I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside
the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it
did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. 'It _is_ unpleasant,' grunted
the uncle. 'He has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the
other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed
accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not
frightful?' They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre
remarks: 'Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--by the
nose'--bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness,
so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle
said, 'The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone
there?' 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent his assistant down the
river with a note to me in these terms: ""Clear this poor devil out of
the country, and don't bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be
alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me."" It was more
than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!' 'Anything since
then?' asked the other, hoarsely. 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew; 'lots
of it--prime sort--lots--most annoying, from him.' 'And with that?'
questioned the heavy rumble. 'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to
speak. Then silence. They had been talking about Kurtz.", one evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat  i heard voices approaching  and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank  i laid my head on my arm again  and had nearly lost myself in a doze  when somebody said in my ear  as it were   i am as harmless as a little child  but i do not like to be dictated to  am i the manager  or am i not  i was ordered to send him there  it is incredible         i became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat  just below my head  i did not move  it did not occur to me to move  i was sleepy   it  is  unpleasant   grunted the uncle   he has asked the administration to be sent there   said the other   with the idea of showing what he could do  and i was instructed accordingly  look at the influence that man must have  is it not frightful   they both agreed it was frightful  then made several bizarre remarks   make rain and fine weather  one man  the council  by the nose   bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness  so that i had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said   the climate may do away with this difficulty for you  is he alone there    yes   answered the manager   he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms   clear this poor devil out of the country  and do not bother sending more of that sort  i had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me   it was more than a year ago  can you imagine such impudence    anything since then   asked the other  hoarsely   ivory   jerked the nephew   lots of it  prime sort  lots  most annoying  from him    and with that   questioned the heavy rumble   invoice   was the reply fired out  so to speak  then silence  they had been talking about kurtz ,1813,335,-3.2,-0.4403749153449138,-0.6176470588235295,-0.4403749153449138,-0.12985106405074004,-3.2,-0.4518647327611325,-0.5000000000000002,-0.4518647327611325,-0.10705345309691748,-87.711070108938,-0.6611929862758307,-0.6909493065703212,-0.6611929862758307,-0.18443687315341026,1.670238095238095,0.6643862794907347,0.7056764796802615,0.6643862794907347,0.25178130479984423,-0.44799999999999884,-0.5100719260210218,-0.3008505056488809,-0.5100719260210218,-0.3243915897042475,-25.251502347684927,-0.580996365796533,-0.5701919029666623,-0.580996365796533,-0.22879136713528658,-1.346655876822762,-0.7200409222563966,-0.7294095048701931,-0.7200409222563966,-0.3115352307958522,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': -0.9344}",-0.9344,-1.2635887884839243,-0.6027998193664925,-1.2635887884839243,-0.3446405723143768,0.07957818930041152,0.15351744257756308,0.23977768319534717,0.15351744257756308,0.0596243475868164,0.3672436694876497,0.36881229296025997,0.4799654797261201,0.36881229296025997,0.021337258131281723,56.72787881115885,0.7218964186753009,1.0164188279065334,0.7218964186753009,-0.5357231730651582,-0.9989,-0.6293259471574894,-0.03273194436686576,-0.6293259471574894,0.1228280830357709
75,75,1,"""I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained
still, having no inducement to change my position. 'How did that ivory
come all this way?' growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The
other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an
English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently
intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods
and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided
to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dug-out with four
paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the
ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such
a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed
to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dug-out,
four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly
on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home--perhaps; setting
his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and
desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply
a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you
understand, had not been pronounced once. He was 'that man.' The
half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult
trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that
scoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very
ill--had recovered imperfectly. . . . The two below me moved away then a
few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard:
'Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--quite alone now--unavoidable
delays--nine months--no news--strange rumors.' They approached again,
just as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know, unless a
species of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from
the natives.' Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in
snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and
of whom the manager did not approve. 'We will not be free from unfair
competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,'
he said. 'Certainly,' grunted the other; 'get him hanged! Why not?
Anything--anything can be done in this country. That's what I say;
nobody here, you understand, _here_, can endanger your position. And
why? You stand the climate--you outlast them all. The danger is in
Europe; but there before I left I took care to--' They moved off and
whispered, then their voices rose again. 'The extraordinary series of
delays is not my fault. I did my possible.' The fat man sighed, 'Very
sad.' 'And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other;
'he bothered me enough when he was here. ""Each station should be like a
beacon on the road towards better things, a center for trade of course,
but also for humanizing, improving, instructing."" Conceive you--that
ass! And he wants to be manager! No, it's--' Here he got choked by
excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was
surprised to see how near they were--right under me. I could have spat
upon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought.
The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious
relative lifted his head. 'You have been well since you came out this
time?' he asked. The other gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a charm--like
a charm. But the rest--oh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick,
too, that I haven't the time to send them out of the country--it's
incredible!' 'H'm. Just so,' grunted the uncle. 'Ah! my boy, trust to
this--I say, trust to this.' I saw him extend his short flipper of
an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the
river,--seemed to beckon with a dishonoring flourish before the sunlit
face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the
hidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling
that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as
though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of
confidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The
high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience,
waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.", i was broad awake by this time  but  lying perfectly at ease  remained still  having no inducement to change my position   how did that ivory

that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the
news came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate
of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found
what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at

78,78,1,"""Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings
of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were
kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air
was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of
sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into
the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sandbanks hippos and
alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed
through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you
would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to
find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for
ever from everything you had known once--somewhere--far away--in another
existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to one,
as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself;
but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered
with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of
plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in
the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force
brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful
aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no
time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by
inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I
was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I
shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the
life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to
keep a look-out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night
for next day's steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort,
to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality--the reality, I tell
you--fades. The inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily. But I felt it
all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at
my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your
respective tight-ropes for--what is it? half-a-crown a tumble--""", going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world  when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings  an empty stream  a great silence  an impenetrable forest  the air was warm  thick  heavy  sluggish  there was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine  the long stretches of the waterway ran on  deserted  into the gloom of overshadowed distances  on silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side  the broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands  you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert  and butted all day long against shoals  trying to find the channel  till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once  somewhere  far away  in another existence perhaps  there were moments when one own past came back to one  as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself  but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream  remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants  and water  and silence  and this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace  it was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention  it looked at you with a vengeful aspect  i got used to it afterwards  i did not see it any more  i had no time  i had to keep guessing at the channel  i had to discern  mostly by inspiration  the signs of hidden banks  i watched for sunken stones  i was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out  when i shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims  i had to keep a look out for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day own steaming  when you have to attend to things of that sort  to the mere incidents of the surface  the reality  the reality  i tell you  fades  the inner truth is hidden  luckily  luckily  but i felt it all the same  i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks  just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight ropes for  what is it  half a crown a tumble   ,2200,390,-5.5,-0.9236200634125613,-1.1588235294117646,-0.9236200634125613,-0.24850505147783256,-6.5,-1.1631353094562036,-1.1734693877551023,-1.1631353094562036,-0.30136026953021494,-114.26261890553246,-0.9679312797669541,-0.9548128397721332,-0.9679312797669541,-0.22407141795260416,-0.539583333333332,-0.23457469068929662,-0.25308799637206053,-0.23457469068929662,-0.08748450380487148,-0.5199999999999978,-0.5204992907778399,-0.31303685524478475,-0.5204992907778399,-0.3242942904015648,-6.249447362166119,-0.09178189273161105,-0.14111573382287018,-0.09178189273161105,-0.04863783399720739,0.9833784654888049,0.6075542891268851,0.532642089161286,0.6075542891268851,0.1954120901859077,"{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9201}",0.9201,1.3113697457204991,0.5935746080898007,1.3113697457204991,0.29150687633491246,0.04015444015444014,-0.07008683530054485,-0.006629256150998911,-0.07008683530054485,-0.07367841701446441,0.5022191414729921,0.7028818834650407,0.7728348664418427,0.7028818834650407,0.09142977628383632,65.39466795500553,1.0000143562866526,1.2964009749989769,1.0000143562866526,-0.5619016045627954,-0.9915,-0.6200499453771591,-0.01619840250237386,-0.6200499453771591,0.17208529730669428

80,80,1,"""I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of
the price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well
done? You do your tricks very well. And I didn't do badly either, since
I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. It's a wonder to
me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road.
I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell
you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that's
supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.
No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the
very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and
think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend
to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to
wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.
We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine
fellows--cannibals--in their place. They were men one could work with,
and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other
before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat
which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three
or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came upon
a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and
the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of
joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange,--had the appearance
of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in
the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence, along empty
reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our
winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the
stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running
up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept
the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the
floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and
yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you
were small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted
it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know.
To some place where they expected to get something, I bet! For me it
crawled toward Kurtz--exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started
leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed
behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar
the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart
of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of
drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain
sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till
the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could
not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness;
the woodcutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig
would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an
earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied
ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance,
to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But
suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush
walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs,
a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes
rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer
toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.
The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who
could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings;
we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane
men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not
understand, because we were too far and could not remember, because we
were traveling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone,
leaving hardly a sign--and no memories.", i beg your pardon  i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price  and indeed what does the price matter  if the trick be well done  you do your

form of a conquered monster, but there--there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were
not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion of
their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled, and
leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just
the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote
kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly
enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that
there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible
frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it
which you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend.
And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything
is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after
all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valor, rage--who can tell?--but
truth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and
shudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at
least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that
truth with his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles?
Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would
fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An
appeal to me in this fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit,
but I have a voice too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that
cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine
sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go
ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn't. Fine sentiments, you
say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with
white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on
those leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and
circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.
There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And
between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was
an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there
below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a
dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs.
A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted
at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of
intrepidity--and he had filed teeth too, the poor devil, and the wool of
his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each
of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping
his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to
strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because
he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should the water
in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler
would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible
vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully
(with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of
polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip),
while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left
behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept on, towards
Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow,
the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither
that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.", the earth seemed unearthly  we are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster  but there  there you could look

82,82,1,"""Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds,
an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of
what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked
woodpile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of
firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing
on it. When deciphered it said: 'Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach
cautiously.' There was a signature, but it was illegible--not
Kurtz--a much longer word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the river? 'Approach
cautiously.' We had not done so. But the warning could not have been
meant for the place where it could be only found after approach.
Something was wrong above. But what--and how much? That was the
question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic
style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far,
either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and
flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could
see a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude
table--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner,
and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the
pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the
back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which
looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, 'An
Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a man Tower, Towson--some
such name--Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary
reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of
figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing
antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve
in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the
breaking strain of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not
a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a
singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going
to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,
luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor,
with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and
the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something
unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but
still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin, and plainly
referring to the text. I couldn't believe my eyes! They were in cipher!
Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that
description into this nowhere and studying it--and making notes--in
cipher at that!

the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on
tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the
wretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last
flickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a
tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but
I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long
on one thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed
a beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with
myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could
come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,
indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter
what anyone knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One

86,86,1,"""Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight
miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked
grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it
would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we
were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning
to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in
daylight--not at dusk, or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight
miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us, and I could also see
suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was
annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since
one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had
plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle
of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a
railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had
set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on
the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every
living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone,
even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep--it
seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any
kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself
of being deaf--then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as
well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud
splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose
there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the
night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round
you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a
shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees,
of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun
hanging over it--all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came
down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the
chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it
stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of
infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A
complaining clamor, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The
sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know
how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had
screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did
this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried
outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short,
leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately
listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. 'Good God!
What is the meaning--?' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims,--a
little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore side-spring
boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained
open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush
out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at
'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we
were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of
dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around
her--and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our
eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off
without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.", towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from kurtz own station  i wanted to push on  but the manager looked grave  and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable  the sun being very low already  to wait where we were till next morning  moreover  he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed  we must approach in daylight  not at dusk  or in the dark  this was sensible enough  eight miles meant nearly three hours  steaming for us  and i could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach  nevertheless  i was annoyed beyond expression at the delay  and most unreasonably too  since one night more could not matter much after so many months  as we had plenty of wood  and caution was the word  i brought up in the middle of the stream  the reach was narrow  straight  with high sides like a railway cutting  the dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set  the current ran smooth and swift  but a dumb immobility sat on the banks  the living trees  lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth  might have been changed into stone  even to the slenderest twig  to the lightest leaf  it was not sleep  it seemed unnatural  like a state of trance  not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard  you looked on amazed  and began to suspect yourself of being deaf  then the night came suddenly  and struck you blind as well  about three in the morning some large fish leaped  and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired  when the sun rose there was a white fog  very warm and clammy  and more blinding than the night  it did not shift or drive  it was just there  standing all round you like something solid  at eight or nine  perhaps  it lifted as a shutter lifts  we had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees  of the immense matted jungle  with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it  all perfectly still  and then the white shutter came down again  smoothly  as if sliding in greased grooves  i ordered the chain  which we had begun to heave in  to be paid out again  before it stopped running with a muffled rattle  a cry  a very loud cry  as of infinite desolation  soared slowly in the opaque air  it ceased  a complaining clamor  modulated in savage discords  filled our ears  the sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap  i do not know how it struck the others  to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed  so suddenly  and apparently from all sides at once  did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise  it culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking  which stopped short  leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes  and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence   good god  what is the meaning     stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims   a little fat man  with sandy hair and red whiskers  who wore side spring boots  and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks  two others remained open mouthed a whole minute  then dashed into the little cabin  to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances  with winchesters at  ready  in their hands  what we could see was just the steamer we were on  her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving  and a misty strip of water  perhaps two feet broad  around her  and that was all  the rest of the world was nowhere  as far as our eyes and ears were concerned  just nowhere  gone  disappeared  swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind ,3619,641,-16.400000000000002,-3.2137818520809787,-3.7235294117647064,-3.2137818520809787,-0.5479209157108689,-15.9,-3.189178770345194,-3.0918367346938784,-3.189178770345194,-0.5236314284178076,-307.4847991824775,-3.2001416226297486,-2.875012959599851,-3.2001416226297486,-0.461589279486666,-0.7036261904761917,-0.30130774165060553,-0.32426047300080557,-0.30130774165060553,-0.0722587546525603,1.3540000000000032,-0.24909815807954472,0.004146743959717602,-0.24909815807954472,-0.24006018932606893,-78.8832818452051,-1.9617650650981928,-1.7812250522075068,-1.9617650650981928,-0.3735288577902112,-2.7355437840271337,-1.511394466394894,-1.4816937804227013,-1.511394466394894,-0.3307356303656645,"{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9892}",-0.9892,-1.3396781536359341,-0.6381523772659828,-1.3396781536359341,-0.1906796992450173,0.05799571680524061,0.03110561514739671,0.10488257285536061,0.03110561514739671,-0.08604249246797178,0.6384748393006471,1.040120083174177,1.0684820834683677,1.040120083174177,-0.015335421079916313,98.17562691564046,2.0519578785918067,2.3553956177917095,2.0519578785918067,-0.7910933894466429,-0.9992,-0.6297020012837189,-0.03340222309110185,-0.6297020012837189,0.28231505207940477
87,87,1,"""I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to
be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.
'Will they attack?' whispered an awed voice. 'We will all be butchered
in this fog,' murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the
hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious
to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black
fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the
river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The
whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of
being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an
alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially
quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the
chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle
the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested
black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils
and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me.
'Aha!' I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,
with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth--'catch
'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with
them?' 'Eat 'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,
looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude.
I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to
me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been
growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been
engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any
clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still
belonged to the beginnings of time--had no inherited experience to teach
them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper
written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the
river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live.
Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which
couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in
the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it
overboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really
a case of legitimate self-defense. You can't breathe dead hippo waking,
sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on
existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of
brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to
buy their provisions with that currency in river-side villages. You can
see how _that_ worked. There were either no villages, or the people were
hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with
an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for
some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire
itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what
good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid
with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company. For
the rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn't look eatable in the
least--I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like
half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender color, they kept wrapped in
leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it
seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose
of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they
didn't go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good tuck in for
once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men,
with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with
strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their
muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of
those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there.
I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest--not because it
occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I
own to you that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--how
unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped,
that my aspect was not so--what shall I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch
of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that
pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever too. One
can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had
often 'a little fever,' or a little touch of other things--the playful
paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more
serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you
would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives,
capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable
physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it
superstition, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive honor?
No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust
simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs,
and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.
Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating
torment, its black thoughts, its somber and brooding ferocity? Well,
I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.
It's really easier to face bereavement, dishonor, and the perdition of
one's soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these
chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I
would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst
the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me--the fact
dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a
ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought
of it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this
savage clamor that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind
whiteness of the fog.", i went forward  and ordered the chain to be hauled in short  so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary   will they attack   whispered an

88,88,1,"""Two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers as to which bank.
'Left.' 'No, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.' 'It is very
serious,' said the manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if
anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.' I looked at him,
and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of
man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But
when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take
the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.
Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in
the air--in space. We wouldn't be able to tell where we were going
to--whether up or down stream, or across--till we fetched against one
bank or the other,--and then we wouldn't know at first which it was.
Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn't
imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether drowned at once or
not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. 'I authorize
you to take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence. 'I refuse to
take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer he expected, though
its tone might have surprised him. 'Well, I must defer to your judgment.
You are captain,' he said, with marked civility. I turned my shoulder to
him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog. How long would
it last? It was the most hopeless look-out. The approach to this Kurtz
grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as
though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle.

thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get
lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also
judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes were
in it, eyes that had seen us. The river-side bushes were certainly very
thick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable.
However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the
reach--certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of
attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise--of the cries we
had heard. They had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile
intention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had
given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the
steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained
grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a
great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent
itself in violence--but more generally takes the form of apathy. . . .", i did not think they would attack  for several obvious reasons  the thick fog was one  if they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it  as we would be if we attempted to move  still  i had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable  and yet eyes were in it  eyes that had seen us  the river side bushes were certainly very thick  but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable  however  during the short lift i had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach  certainly not abreast of the steamer  but what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise  of the cries we had heard  they had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile intention  unexpected  wild  and violent as they had been  they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow  the glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief  the danger  if any  i expounded  was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose  even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence  but more generally takes the form of apathy       ,1108,194,-11.450000000000001,-2.1737542508049543,-2.558823529411765,-2.1737542508049543,-1.419785327294609,-10.450000000000001,-2.0145046361063645,-1.9795918367346947,-2.0145046361063645,-1.3173351544603558,-238.92523176437956,-2.4081032796531496,-2.1936828484144937,-2.4081032796531496,-1.4180469870199526,-2.6383928571428563,-1.0883757360373891,-1.1636882771964352,-1.0883757360373891,-0.7381982791166022,-5.016,-1.17163029003693,-1.0740066855667925,-1.17163029003693,-0.9237783651976783,-58.907791967397664,-1.4474891742941411,-1.330168222823945,-1.4474891742941411,-0.9216546811333912,-4.276591604555112,-2.3894449182246786,-2.3163947215455707,-2.3894449182246786,-1.7084071980881315,"{'neg': 0.23, 'neu': 0.685, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': -0.9904}",-0.9904,-1.3413443441137152,-0.6389265208696213,-1.3413443441137152,-0.6307936050519943,-0.0726848151848152,-0.710090405560071,-0.7118989514130492,-0.710090405560071,-0.5467459507841206,-0.14624335858560608,-0.9020882541893569,-0.6341971809877055,-0.9020882541893569,-0.6558561645322613,35.886181725179846,0.053084738401711615,0.34312413914331047,0.053084738401711615,-0.288774566996817,-0.9999,-0.630579460911588,-0.0349662067809863,-0.630579460911588,-0.12064656742294175

large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then
well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a
broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow

93,93,1,"""One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just
below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck
there were two little teak-wood houses, with doors and windows. The
boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over the
whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel
projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin
built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch,
two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny
table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad
shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I
spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,
before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An
athletic black belonging to some coast tribe, and educated by my poor
predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore
a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the
world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.
He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost
sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would

94,94,1,"""I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to
see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw
my poleman give up the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on
the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept
hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the
fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his
furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the
river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks,
little sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my
nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All
this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly
quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel
and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by
Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter
on the land side. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was
lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a
reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of
the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw
a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very
fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed
from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,
arms, legs, glaring eyes,--the bush was swarming with human limbs in
movement, glistening, of bronze color. The twigs shook, swayed, and
rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.
'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid,
face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down
his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep quiet!' I said in a
fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.
I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron
deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?'
I caught shape of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another
snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with
their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A
deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at
it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the
doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been
poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat. The bush
began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a
rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the
pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the
wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter
open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening,
glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the
sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I
had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded
smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the
bank--right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.", i was looking down at the sounding pole  and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river  when i saw my poleman give up the business suddenly  and stretch himself flat on the deck  without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in  he kept hold on it though  and it trailed in the water  at the same time the fireman  whom i could also see below me  sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head  i was amazed  then i had to look at the river mighty quick  because there was a snag in the fairway  sticks  little sticks  were flying about  thick  they were whizzing before my nose  dropping below me  striking behind me against my pilot house  all this time the river  the shore  the woods  were very quiet  perfectly quiet  i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern wheel and the patter of these things  we cleared the snag clumsily  arrows  by jove  we were being shot at  i stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land side  that fool helmsman  his hands on the spokes  was lifting his knees high  stamping his feet  champing his mouth  like a reined in horse  confound him  and we were staggering within ten feet of the bank  i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter  and i saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own  looking at me very fierce and steady  and then suddenly  as though a veil had been removed from my eyes  i made out  deep in the tangled gloom  naked breasts  arms  legs  glaring eyes   the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement  glistening  of bronze color  the twigs shook  swayed  and rustled  the arrows flew out of them  and then the shutter came to   ownteer her straight   i said to the helmsman  he held his head rigid  face forward  but his eyes rolled  he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently  his mouth foamed a little   keep quiet   i said in a fury  i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind  i darted out  below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck  confused exclamations  a voice screamed   can you turn back   i caught shape of a v shaped ripple on the water ahead  what  another snag  a fusillade burst out under my feet  the pilgrims had opened with their winchesters  and were simply squirting lead into that bush  a deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward  i swore at it  now i could not see the ripple or the snag either  i stood in the doorway  peering  and the arrows came in swarms  they might have been poisoned  but they looked as though they would not kill a cat  the bush began to howl  our wood cutters raised a warlike whoop  the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me  i glanced over my shoulder  and the pilot house was yet full of noise and smoke when i made a dash at the wheel  the fool nigger had dropped everything  to throw the shutter open and let off that martini henry  he stood before the wide opening  glaring  and i yelled at him to come back  while i straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat  there was no room to turn even if i had wanted to  the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke  there was no time to lose  so i just crowded her into the bank  right into the bank  where i knew the water was deep ,3282,611,-6.8999999999999995,-1.2177692839754772,-1.4882352941176469,-1.2177692839754772,-0.1752420585073079,-6.8999999999999995,-1.2493499248131816,-1.2551020408163267,-1.2493499248131816,-0.15459549837075529,-134.39150443284072,-1.2004713867047698,-1.1548493384087628,-1.2004713867047698,-0.13117346322856138,3.1222666666666665,1.2550751905600763,1.3356610542251353,1.2550751905600763,0.2584026024693024,4.188000000000007,0.1613345047096597,0.48381500444294084,0.1613345047096597,-0.12413481490598235,-48.65899892216319,-1.1836304551715617,-1.098745207705421,-1.1836304551715617,-0.24172366940157147,-1.9874799341720477,-1.085166420377641,-1.0765086906568895,-1.085166420377641,-0.25209073580499275,"{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': -0.9442}",-0.9442,-1.2771960107191378,-0.60912199212954,-1.2771960107191378,-0.190941867536663,0.025137017070979328,-0.15526290599169135,-0.10049139100690926,-0.15526290599169135,-0.13490797881409763,0.4498970633970182,0.5733826867584131,0.6593065735423248,0.5733826867584131,-0.11040608467055316,94.63462148096134,1.9383267388215775,2.2410028146425334,1.9383267388215775,-0.7638668532115378,-0.9969,-0.6268189196492919,-0.028263419538624678,-0.6268189196492919,0.27415864406316287
95,95,1,"""We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs
and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen
it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting
whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out
at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty
rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent
double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something
big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,
and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an
extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The
side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared
a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It
looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had
lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were
clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred
yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my
feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had
rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched
that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged
through the opening, had caught him in the side just below the ribs; the
blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes
were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the
wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing luster. The fusillade burst out
again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something
precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from
him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend
to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of
the steam-whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The
tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from
the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of
mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight
of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the
bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out
sharply--then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came
plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when
the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the

Absurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer
nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes. Now I think of
it, it is amazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud
of my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the
inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I
was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh yes, I heard more than
enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a
voice. And I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them were
so little more than voices--and the memory of that time itself lingers
around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber,
silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of
sense.

102,102,1,"""I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,"" he began suddenly.
""Girl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it--completely.
They--the women, I mean--are out of it--should be out of it. We must
help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours
gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the
disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.' You would have
perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty
frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,
but this--ah specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted
him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball--an ivory ball; it had
caressed him, and--lo!--he had withered; it had taken him, loved him,
embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed
his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish
initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favorite. Ivory? I should
think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting
with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above
or below the ground in the whole country. 'Mostly fossil,' the manager
had remarked disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they
call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury
the tusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn't bury this parcel
deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the
steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could
see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this
favor had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say,
'My ivory.' Oh yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my
river, my--' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in
expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of
laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything
belonged to him--but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he
belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That
was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible--it
was not good for one either--trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat
amongst the devils of the land--I mean literally. You can't understand.
How could you?--with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind
neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately
between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and
gallows and lunatic asylums--how can you imagine what particular region
of the first ages a man's untrammeled feet may take him into by the way
of solitude--utter solitude without a policeman--by the way of silence,
utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard
whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the great
difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate
strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may
be too much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you are being
assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a
bargain for his soul with the devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or
the devil too much of a devil--I don't know which. Or you may be such
a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to
anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only
a standing place--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain
I won't pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other.
The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with
sights, with sounds, with smells too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo,
so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don't you see?
Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of
unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--your power of devotion,
not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that's
difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain--I am
trying to account to myself for--for--Mr. Kurtz--for the shade of Mr.
Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honored me with
its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because
it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated
partly in England, and--as he was good enough to say himself--his
sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his
father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz;
and by-and-by I learned that, most appropriately, the International
Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the
making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it too.
I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence,
but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had
found time for! But this must have been before his--let us say--nerves,
went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending
with unspeakable rites, which--as far as I reluctantly gathered
from what I heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you
understand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece
of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later
information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument
that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must
necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural
beings--we approach them with the might as of a deity,' and so on, and
so on. 'By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good
practically unbounded,' &c., &c. From that point he soared and took me
with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember,
you know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an
august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the
unbounded power of eloquence--of words--of burning noble words. There
were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,
unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently
much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of
a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to
every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying,
like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!'
The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that
valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to
himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet'
(he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence
upon his career. I had full information about all these things, and,
besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I've
done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I
choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst
all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of
civilization. But then, you see, I can't choose. He won't be forgotten.
Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or
frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his
honor; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter
misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered
one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with
self-seeking. No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm
the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I
missed my late helmsman awfully,--I missed him even while his body
was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing
strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of
sand in a black Sahara. Well, don't you see, he had done something, he
had steered; for months I had him at my back--a help--an instrument. It
was a kind of partnership. He steered for me--I had to look after him, I
worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,
of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the
intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt
remains to this day in my memory--like a claim of distant kinship
affirmed in a supreme moment.", i laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie   he began suddenly   girl  what  did i mention a girl  oh  she is out of it  completely  they  the women  i mean  are

103,103,1,"""Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint,
no restraint--just like Kurtz--a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as
I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first
jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed
with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little
door-step; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from
behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on
earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.
The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I
saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the
pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck
about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited
magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.
What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can't guess.
Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous,
murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise
scandalized, and with a better show of reason--though I admit that the
reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind
that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have
him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was
dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause
some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the

trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on
the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the

background. There was no inclosure or fence of any kind; but there had
been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained
in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with
round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had
disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank
was clear, and on the water-side I saw a white man under a hat like a
cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the
edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see
movements--human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently,

seen somewhere. As I maneuvered to get alongside, I was asking myself,
'What does this fellow look like?' Suddenly I got it. He looked like
a harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown
holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright
patches, blue, red, and yellow,--patches on the back, patches on front,
patches on elbows, on knees; colored binding round his jacket, scarlet
edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him look
extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see how
beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish face,
very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes,
smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like
sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain. 'Look out, captain!' he
cried; 'there's a snag lodged in here last night.' What! Another snag? I
confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off
that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose
up to me. 'You English?' he asked, all smiles. 'Are you?' I shouted from
the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for
my disappointment. Then he brightened up. 'Never mind!' he cried
encouragingly. 'Are we in time?' I asked. 'He is up there,' he replied,

teeth, had gone to the house, this chap came on board. 'I say, I
don't like this. These natives are in the bush,' I said. He assured me
earnestly it was all right. 'They are simple people,' he added; 'well,
I am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.' 'But you
said it was all right,' I cried. 'Oh, they meant no harm,' he said; and
as I stared he corrected himself, 'Not exactly.' Then vivaciously, 'My
faith, your pilot-house wants a clean up!' In the next breath he advised
me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any
trouble. 'One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.
They are simple people,' he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate
he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of
silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. 'Don't

listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe exaltation. 'But now--' He

reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a
Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods,
and had started for the interior with a light heart, and no more idea of
what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that
river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything.

Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,' he narrated with keen
enjoyment; 'but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he

111,111,2,"""I looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in
motley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic,
fabulous. His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and
altogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem. It was
inconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so
far, how he had managed to remain--why he did not instantly disappear.
'I went a little farther,' he said, 'then still a little farther--till
I had gone so far that I don't know how I'll ever get back. Never mind.
Plenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away quick--quick--I tell
you.' The glamour of youth enveloped his particolored rags, his
destitution, his loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile
wanderings. For months--for years--his life hadn't been worth a day's
purchase; and there he was gallantly, thoughtlessly alive, to all
appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and
of his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced into something like
admiration--like envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him unscathed.
He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and
to push on through. His need was to exist, and to move onwards at
the greatest possible risk, and with a maximum of privation. If the
absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure had ever
ruled a human being, it ruled this be-patched youth. I almost envied
him the possession of this modest and clear flame. It seemed to have
consumed all thought of self so completely, that, even while he was
talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the man before your eyes--who
had gone through these things. I did not envy him his devotion to Kurtz,

114,114,2,"""On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken
by various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse
Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky
feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the
forest. 'Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and
days before he would turn up,' he said. 'Ah, it was worth waiting
for!--sometimes.' 'What was he doing? exploring or what?' I asked. 'Oh
yes, of course;' he had discovered lots of villages, a lake too--he
did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire
too much--but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. 'But he had no
goods to trade with by that time,' I objected. 'There's a good lot of
cartridges left even yet,' he answered, looking away. 'To speak plainly,
he raided the country,' I said. He nodded. 'Not alone, surely!' He
muttered something about the villages round that lake. 'Kurtz got the
tribe to follow him, did he?' I suggested. He fidgeted a little. 'They
adored him,' he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that
I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness
and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his
thoughts, swayed his emotions. 'What can you expect?' he burst out; 'he
came to them with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had never
seen anything like it--and very terrible. He could be very terrible.
You can't judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no!
Now--just to give you an idea--I don't mind telling you, he wanted to
shoot me too one day--but I don't judge him.' 'Shoot you!' I cried.
'What for?' 'Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village
near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well,
he wanted it, and wouldn't hear reason. He declared he would shoot me
unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because
he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth
to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true too.
I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn't clear out. No, no. I
couldn't leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly
again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to
keep out of the way; but I didn't mind. He was living for the most part
in those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes
he would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful.
This man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn't
get away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there
was time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then
he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;
forget himself amongst these people--forget himself--you know.' 'Why!
he's mad,' I said. He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn't be mad.
If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn't dare hint at
such a thing. . . . I had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was
looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and
at the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in
that bush, so silent, so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house
on the hill--made me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature
of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in
desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in
hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask--heavy,
like the closed door of a prison--they looked with their air of hidden
knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The
Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had
come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of
that lake tribe. He had been absent for several months--getting himself
adored, I suppose--and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to
all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream.
Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the--what
shall I say?--less material aspirations. However he had got much worse
suddenly. 'I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came up--took my
chance,' said the Russian. 'Oh, he is bad, very bad.' I directed my
glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there was the
ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three
little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought
within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque movement,
and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the
field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the
distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the
ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its
first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. Then
I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake.
These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive
and puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought and also for
the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky; but at all
events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole.
They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes, if
their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the first I had
made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may think. The
start back I had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise.
I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I returned
deliberately to the first I had seen--and there it was, black, dried,
sunken, with closed eyelids,--a head that seemed to sleep at the top of
that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line
of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously at some endless and
jocose dream of that eternal slumber.", on the contrary  it appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes  he had  as he informed me proudly  managed to nurse kurtz through two

opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there

showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his
various lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small
matter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under
his magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I
can't say. I think the knowledge came to him at last--only at the very
last. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a
terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered
to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he
had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the

116,116,2,"""The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen. In a hurried,
indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take
these--say, symbols--down. He was not afraid of the natives; they would
not stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendency was extraordinary.
The camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came
every day to see him. They would crawl. . . . 'I don't want to know
anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I shouted.
Curious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more
intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz's
windows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at
one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle
horrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being
something that had a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine. The
young man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did not occur to him
Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadn't heard any of these
splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct of
life--or what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he
crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had no idea of the
conditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him
excessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I
was to hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workers--and these
were rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their
sticks. 'You don't know how such a life tries a man like Kurtz,' cried
Kurtz's last disciple. 'Well, and you?' I said. 'I! I! I am a simple
man. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from anybody. How can
you compare me to . . .?' His feelings were too much for speech, and
suddenly he broke down. 'I don't understand,' he groaned. 'I've been
doing my best to keep him alive, and that's enough. I had no hand in
all this. I have no abilities. There hasn't been a drop of medicine or a
mouthful of invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned.

of the bearers. 'Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love

to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring
necessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the
thin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of
that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with
grotesque jerks. Kurtz--Kurtz--that means short in German--don't it?
Well, the name was as true as everything else in his life--and death.
He looked at least seven feet long. His covering had fallen off, and his
body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. I
could see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.
It was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had
been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of
dark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him
a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the
air, all the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached
me faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The
stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at
the same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without
any perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected
these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn
in a long aspiration.",  now  if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for   said the russian at my elbow  the knot of men with the stretcher had stopped too  half way to the steamer  as if petrified  i saw the man on the stretcher sit up  lank and with an uplifted arm  above the shoulders of the bearers   let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time   i said  i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation  as if to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring necessity  i could not hear a sound  but through my glasses i saw the thin arm extended commandingly  the lower jaw moving  the eyes of that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with grotesque jerks  kurtz  kurtz  that means short in german  do not it  well  the name was as true as everything else in his life  and death  he looked at least seven feet long  his covering had fallen off  and his body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding sheet  i could see the cage of his ribs all astir  the bones of his arm waving  it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of dark and glittering bronze  i saw him open his mouth wide  it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect  as though he had wanted to swallow all the air  all the earth  all the men before him  a deep voice reached me faintly  he must have been shouting  he fell back suddenly  the stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again  and almost at the same time i noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without any perceptible movement of retreat  as if the forest that had ejected these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn in a long aspiration ,1845,344,-7.6999999999999975,-1.3858545528685715,-1.6764705882352935,-1.3858545528685715,-0.4644439600317883,-7.199999999999999,-1.3140108863309155,-1.3163265306122451,-1.3140108863309155,-0.41780532052333585,-174.83456923884492,-1.6676922172928441,-1.5567637447951375,-1.6676922172928441,-0.49790057100161694,-1.8658833333333336,-0.7741168995457618,-0.8285233270948003,-0.7741168995457618,-0.30270557084220484,5.573000000000002,0.3619164517678974,0.7182329793085941,0.3619164517678974,0.10434767579312273,-6.303726989935503,-0.09317934050858022,-0.14234139571910126,-0.09317934050858022,-0.05562066436827587,-1.8445137997483225,-1.0037078976407532,-0.9990717900217768,-1.0037078976407532,-0.4155457162555006,"{'neg': 0.122, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.9712}",-0.9712,-1.3146852964692155,-0.6265402232114057,-1.3146852964692155,-0.3488418742895177,-0.07700892857142856,-0.7346159839797364,-0.7389255931724832,-0.7346159839797364,-0.39738376918389223,-0.4450885042197952,-1.6417417183179852,-1.28263050918796,-1.6417417183179852,-0.8535257746219426,59.5274908100595,0.8117361854358726,1.1068607857606123,0.8117361854358726,-0.47718685189891646,-0.9994,-0.6299527040345386,-0.033849075573925906,-0.6299527040345386,0.13140874430390573

treading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous
ornaments. She carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of

necessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. 'We have
done all we could for him--haven't we? But there is no disguising the
fact, Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company. He did
not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. Cautiously,
cautiously--that's my principle. We must be cautious yet. The district
is closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will
suffer. I don't deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly
fossil. We must save it, at all events--but look how precarious the
position is--and why? Because the method is unsound.' 'Do you,' said I,
looking at the shore, 'call it ""unsound method""?' 'Without doubt,' he
exclaimed, hotly. 'Don't you?' . . . 'No method at all,' I murmured
after a while. 'Exactly,' he exulted. 'I anticipated this. Shows a
complete want of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the proper
quarter.' 'Oh,' said I, 'that fellow--what's his name?--the brickmaker,
will make a readable report for you.' He appeared confounded for a
moment. It seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile,
and I turned mentally to Kurtz for relief--positively for relief.
'Nevertheless I think Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,' I said with
emphasis. He started, dropped on me a cold heavy glance, said very
quietly, 'He _was_,' and turned his back on me. My hour of favor was

would give it up, thinking him dead. I could not stop him. Oh, I had an

said I; 'I shall keep my eyes open.' 'But quiet--eh?' he urged,
anxiously. 'It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here--' I
promised a complete discretion with great gravity. 'I have a canoe and
three black fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a
few Martini-Henry cartridges?' I could, and did, with proper secrecy. He
helped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco. 'Between
sailors--you know--good English tobacco.' At the door of the pilot-house
he turned round--' I say, haven't you a pair of shoes you could spare?'
He raised one leg. 'Look.' The soles were tied with knotted strings
sandal-wise under his bare feet. I rooted out an old pair, at which he
looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm. One of his
pockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the other (dark
blue) peeped 'Towson's Inquiry,' &c., &c. He seemed to think himself
excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.

133,133,2,"""When I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with
its hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to
make me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a
big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the
station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,
armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within
the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from
the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed
the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping
their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air
with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of
many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from
the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of
a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.
I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of
yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke
me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the

fallen over him too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long,
pale, indistinct, like a vapor exhaled by the earth, and swayed
slightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed
between the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.
I had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I seemed
to come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion. It was
by no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could hardly
stand, there was still plenty of vigor in his voice. 'Go away--hide
yourself,' he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced
back. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure
stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the
glow. It had horns--antelope horns, I think--on its head. Some sorcerer,
some witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiend-like enough. 'Do you know what
you are doing?' I whispered. 'Perfectly,' he answered, raising his voice
for that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail
through a speaking-trumpet. 'If he makes a row we are lost,' I thought
to myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from
the very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and
tormented thing. 'You will be lost,' I said--'utterly lost.' One gets
sometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the right

you try to shout I'll smash your head with--' There was not a stick or
a stone near. 'I will throttle you for good,' I corrected myself. 'I was
on the threshold of great things,' he pleaded, in a voice of longing,
with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. 'And now for
this stupid scoundrel--' 'Your success in Europe is assured in any
case,' I affirmed, steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of
him, you understand--and indeed it would have been very little use for
any practical purpose. I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell
of the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of gratified
and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had driven him out
to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the
throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had beguiled
his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations. And, don't
you see, the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the
head--though I had a very lively sense of that danger too--but in this,
that I had to deal with a being to whom I could not appeal in the
name of anything high or low. I had, even like the niggers, to invoke
him--himself his own exalted and incredible degradation. There was
nothing either above or below him, and I knew it. He had kicked himself
loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had kicked the very earth to
pieces. He was alone, and I before him did not know whether I stood
on the ground or floated in the air. I've been telling you what we
said--repeating the phrases we pronounced,--but what's the good? They
were common everyday words,--the familiar, vague sounds exchanged on
every waking day of life. But what of that? They had behind them, to my
mind, the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams, of phrases
spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody had ever struggled with a soul,
I am the man. And I wasn't arguing with a lunatic either. Believe me
or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear--concentrated, it is true,
upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein was my only
chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and then, which wasn't
so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was mad. Being
alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by heavens! I
tell you, it had gone mad. I had--for my sins, I suppose--to go through
the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could have been so
withering to one's belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity.
He struggled with himself, too. I saw it,--I heard it. I saw the
inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith, and
no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty well;
but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my forehead,
while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a ton on my
back down that hill. And yet I had only supported him, his bony arm
clasped round my neck--and he was not much heavier than a child.",  i had immense plans   he muttered irresolutely   yes   said i   but if you try to shout I will smash your head with    there was not a stick or a stone near   i will throttle you for good   i corrected myself   i was on the threshold of great things   he pleaded  in a voice of longing  with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold   and now for this stupid scoundrel     your success in europe is assured in any case   i affirmed  steadily  i did not want to have the throttling of him  you understand  and indeed it would have been very little use for any practical purpose  i tried to break the spell  the heavy  mute spell of the wilderness  that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts  by the memory of gratified and monstrous passions  this alone  i was convinced  had driven him out to the edge of the forest  to the bush  towards the gleam of fires  the throb of drums  the drone of weird incantations  this alone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations  and  do not you see  the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the head  though i had a very lively sense of that danger too  but in this  that i had to deal with a being to whom i could not appeal in the name of anything high or low  i had  even like the niggers  to invoke him  himself his own exalted and incredible degradation  there was nothing either above or below him  and i knew it  he had kicked himself loose of the earth  confound the man  he had kicked the very earth to pieces  he was alone  and i before him did not know whether i stood on the ground or floated in the air  I have been telling you what we said  repeating the phrases we pronounced   but what is the good  they were common everyday words   the familiar  vague sounds exchanged on every waking day of life  but what of that  they had behind them  to my mind  the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams  of phrases spoken in nightmares  soul  if anybody had ever struggled with a soul  i am the man  and i was not arguing with a lunatic either  believe me or not  his intelligence was perfectly clear  concentrated  it is true  upon himself with horrible intensity  yet clear  and therein was my only chance  barring  of course  the killing him there and then  which was not so good  on account of unavoidable noise  but his soul was mad  being alone in the wilderness  it had looked within itself  and  by heavens  i tell you  it had gone mad  i had  for my sins  i suppose  to go through the ordeal of looking into it myself  no eloquence could have been so withering to one own belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity  he struggled with himself  too  i saw it   i heard it  i saw the inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint  no faith  and no fear  yet struggling blindly with itself  i kept my head pretty well  but when i had him at last stretched on the couch  i wiped my forehead  while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my back down that hill  and yet i had only supported him  his bony arm clasped round my neck  and he was not much heavier than a child ,3169,575,-2.5000000000000004,-0.2933003050634559,-0.4529411764705884,-0.2933003050634559,0.005858864597543118,-2.5000000000000004,-0.30098915588642056,-0.3571428571428573,-0.30098915588642056,0.03508768412975129,-108.22632176848519,-0.8981966101622674,-0.8948254280305791,-0.8981966101622674,-0.09080531816473435,-9.493257142857138,-3.876951939102739,-4.137774907151566,-3.876951939102739,-0.8932035688298525,-1.4950000000000019,-0.6617031885264197,-0.4780603393559859,-0.6617031885264197,-0.3552597934802993,-73.20681233920897,-1.8156223957731477,-1.6530474529030872,-1.8156223957731477,-0.38643892980647016,-2.3105655445069555,-1.2692525093071034,-1.2515064158523408,-1.2692525093071034,-0.31141949174218403,"{'neg': 0.154, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': -0.8207}",-0.8207,-1.1057172407141518,-0.5294497129217469,-1.1057172407141518,-0.17635792031895292,-0.017850125642678842,-0.3990780989339116,-0.3691703090899576,-0.3990780989339116,-0.20640381177334122,0.1368941503556232,-0.20131180734861628,-0.01984623721889849,-0.20131180734861628,-0.2927835487606028,91.03628245357405,1.822855759602714,2.12475783970049,1.822855759602714,-0.7095758154192133,-0.8393,-0.42926515200333953,0.3238563369267721,-0.42926515200333953,0.29342913104154317

survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the
barren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes
of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now--images of wealth
and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of
noble and lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my
ideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated
sentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of
the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mold of
primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of

158,158,2,"""However, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did
not. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show
my loyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life
is--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.
The most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself--that comes
too late--a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with
death. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place
in an impalpable grayness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,
without spectators, without clamor, without glory, without the great
desire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly
atmosphere of tepid skepticism, without much belief in your own right,
and still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of
ultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think
it to be. I was within a hair's-breadth of the last opportunity for
pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would
have nothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a
remarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped
over the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that
could not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace
the whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that
beat in the darkness. He had summed up--he had judged. 'The horror!' He
was a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort
of belief; it had candor, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note
of revolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed
truth--the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own
extremity I remember best--a vision of grayness without form filled
with physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all
things--even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to
have lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped
over the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating
foot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the
wisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that
inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the
invisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been
a word of careless contempt. Better his cry--much better. It was
an affirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by
abominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory!
That is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,

159,159,2,"""No, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I
remember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some
inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself
back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying
through the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour
their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their
insignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They
were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense,
because I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew.
Their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals
going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was
offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of
a danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to
enlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from
laughing in their faces, so full of stupid importance. I dare say I was
not very well at that time. I tottered about the streets--there were
various affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable
persons. I admit my behavior was inexcusable, but then my temperature
was seldom normal in these days. My dear aunt's endeavors to 'nurse up
my strength' seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength
that wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept
the bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do
with it. His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by
his Intended. A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing
gold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at
first circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased
to denominate certain 'documents.' I was not surprised, because I had
had two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused
to give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same
attitude with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last,
and with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit
of information about its 'territories.' And, said he, 'Mr. Kurtz's
knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive
and peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable
circumstances in which he had been placed: therefore'--I assured him Mr.
Kurtz's knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems
of commerce or administration. He invoked then the name of science. 'It
would be an incalculable loss if,' &c., &c. I offered him the report on
the 'Suppression of Savage Customs,' with the postscriptum torn off. He
took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt.
'This is not what we had a right to expect,' he remarked. 'Expect
nothing else,' I said. 'There are only private letters.' He withdrew
upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more; but
another fellow, calling himself Kurtz's cousin, appeared two days later,
and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative's last
moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had been
essentially a great musician. 'There was the making of an immense
success,' said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank gray
hair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt
his statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz's
profession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest of his
talents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else
for a journalist who could paint--but even the cousin (who took snuff
during the interview) could not tell me what he had been--exactly. He
was a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the old chap, who
thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and
withdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and
memoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know
something of the fate of his 'dear colleague' turned up. This visitor
informed me Kurtz's proper sphere ought to have been politics 'on the
popular side.' He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped
short, an eye-glass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive,
confessed his opinion that Kurtz really couldn't write a bit--'but
heavens! how that man could talk! He electrified large meetings. He had
faith--don't you see?--he had the faith. He could get himself to believe
anything--anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme
party.' 'What party?' I asked. 'Any party,' answered the other. 'He
was an--an--extremist.' Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he
asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, 'what it was that had induced
him to go out there?' 'Yes,' said I, and forthwith handed him the
famous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it
hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged 'it would do,' and took himself
off with this plunder.", no  they did not bury me  though there is a period of time which i remember mistily  with a shuddering wonder  like a passage through some inconceivable world that had no hope

portrait. She struck me as beautiful--I mean she had a beautiful
expression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie too, yet one
felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the
delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to
listen without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought
for herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait
and those letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling
perhaps. All that had been Kurtz's had passed out of my hands: his soul,
his body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained
only his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that up too to
the past, in a way,--to surrender personally all that remained of him
with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. I
don't defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really

161,161,2,"""I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that
accumulate in every man's life,--a vague impress on the brain of shadows
that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the
high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still
and decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him
on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the
earth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much
as he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of
frightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and
draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to
enter the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild
crowd of obedient worshipers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of
the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and
muffled like the beating of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.
It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful
rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the
salvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say
afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of
fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to
me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I
remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale
of his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish
of his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner,
when he said one day, 'This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company
did not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.
I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. H'm. It is a
difficult case. What do you think I ought to do--resist? Eh? I want no
more than justice.' . . . He wanted no more than justice--no more than
justice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and
while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare

me in the dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his
death, more than a year since the news came; she seemed as though she
would remember and mourn for ever. She took both my hands in hers and
murmured, 'I had heard you were coming.' I noticed she was not very
young--I mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for
belief, for suffering. The room seemed to have grown darker, as if all
the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead.
This fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by
an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance was
guileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her sorrowful
head as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say,
'I--I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.' But while we were
still shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her
face that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the
playthings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by Jove!
the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died
only yesterday--nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in the same
instant of time--his death and her sorrow--I saw her sorrow in the very
moment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together--I heard
them together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, 'I have
survived;' while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled
with her tone of despairing regret, the summing-up whisper of his
eternal condemnation. I asked myself what I was doing there, with a
sensation of panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place
of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold. She
motioned me to a chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on the
little table, and she put her hand over it. . . . 'You knew him well,'
