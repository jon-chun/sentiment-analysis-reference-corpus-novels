"6","5,""And since the district to which we had moved appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard we had previously overlooked was noisy, the sound of a man singing in the street as he passed (as feeble perhaps as an orchestral motif yet quite clear even from a distance) brought tears to the eyes of the exiled Francoise.""",-1.8,0,-5,-1
"7","6,""And if I had made fun of her when she had been distressed at leaving an apartment block where we had been so well thought of by everybody, weeping as she packed her trunks in accordance with the rituals of Combray and declaring that our former home was superior to any other imaginable, I, who found it as difficult to assimilate new surroundings as I found it easy to abandon old ones, none the less felt a close sympathy with our old servant when I realized that the move to a building where the concierge, who had not yet made our acquaintance, had not shown her the tokens of respect necessary to the nourishment of her good spirits, had driven her to a state close to total decline.""",2.7,4,6,5
"8","7,""She alone could understand my feelings; this was certainly not the case with her young footman; for him, a person as remote from the Combray world as it was possible to be, moving into a new district was like taking a holiday in which the novelty of the surroundings provided the same sense of relaxation as an actual journey; he felt he was in the country and a head cold gave him the delightful sensation, as if he had been a victim of a draught from the ill-fitting window of a railway carriage, of having seen something of the world; every time he sneezed, he rejoiced that he had found such a select position, having always wanted to work for people who travelled a great deal.""",6.9,5,3,6
"9","8,""And so it was not to him I went, but straight to Francoise; and because I had laughed at her tears over a departure that had not affected me in the least, she now showed a frosty indifference to my misery, because she shared it.""",-0.35,-2,-4,-3

"12","11,This is what happened when I tried to talk to her about our move.",0.4,0,0,1
"13","12,""What is more, she was obliged, two days later, to return to our former home to collect some clothes that had been forgotten in the move, while I, as a result of the same move, was still running a temperature, and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox, was feeling painfully swollen by the sight of a long sideboard which my eyes needed to digest; and Francoise, with a womans inconstancy, returned home saying that she thought she was going to choke to death on our old boulevard, that she had gone all around the houses to get there, that never had she seen such awkward stairs, that she would not go back there to live for all the world, not if you were to offer her a fortune unlikely hypotheses and that everything (meaning everything to do with the kitchen and the hallways) was far better appointed in our new home.""",-1.05,-3,-1,-3
"14","13,""And this new home, it is time to explain and to add that we had moved into it because my grandmother was far from well (though we kept this reason from her) and needed cleaner air was a flat that formed part of the Hotel de Guermantes.""",3.3,2,2,3
"15","14,""At an age when Names, offering us the image of the unknowable that we have invested in them and simultaneously designating a real place for us, force us accordingly to identify the one with the other to a point where we go off to a city to seek out a soul that it cannot contain but which we no longer have the power to expel from its name, it is not only to cities and ruins that they give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical world that they spangle with differences and people with marvels, it is the social world as well: so every historic house, every famous residence or palace, has its lady or its fairy, as forests have their spirits and rivers their deities.""",0.9,1,0,2
"16","15,""Sometimes, hidden deep in her name, the fairy is transformed by the needs of our imaginative activity through which she lives; this is how the atmosphere surrounding Madame de Guermantes, after existing for years in my mind only as the reflection of a magic-lantern slide and of a stained-glass window, began to lose its colours when quite different dreams impregnated it with the bubbling water of fast-flowing streams.""",0.25,2,3,-1
"17","16,""However, the fairy wastes away when we come into contact with the actual person to whom her name corresponds, for the name then begins to reflect that person who contains nothing of the fairy; the fairy can reappear if we absent ourselves from the person, but if we stay in the persons presence the fairy dies for ever and with her the name, as with the Lusignan family, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy Melusine should die.""",-1.45,-2,-3,0
"18","17,""So the Name, beneath the successive retouchings which might eventually lead us to discover the original handsome portrait of an unknown woman we have never met, becomes no more than the mere photograph on an identity card to which we refer when we need to decide whether we know, whether or not we should acknowledge a person we encounter.""",0.5,1,2,0
"19","18,""But should a sensation from the distant past like those musical instruments that record and preserve the sound and style of the various artists who played them enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular tone it then had for our ears, even if the name seems not to have changed, we can still feel the distance between the various dreams which its unchanging syllables evoked for us in turn.""",3.15,2,3,3
"20","19,""For a second, rehearing the warbling from some distant springtime, we can extract from it, as from the little tubes of colour used in painting, the precise tint forgotten, mysterious and fresh of the days we thought we remembered when, like bad painters, we were in fact spreading our whole past on a single canvas and painting it with the conventional monochrome of voluntary memory.""",-0.4,1,-1,-2
"21","20,""Yet, on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it, in order to create something original, a unique blend, was using those colours from the past that now elude us, colours which, for instance, are still able to fill me with sudden delight, should the name Guermantes, assuming for a second after so many years the ring it had for me so different from its present resonance on the day of Mlle Percepieds marriage, chance to restore to me the mauve colour, so soft, too bright and new, which lent the smoothness of velvet to the billowing scarf of the young Duchesse, and to her eyes like inaccessible and ever-flowering periwinkles lit by the blue sun of her smile.""",7.95,5,11,9
"22","21,""And the name Guermantes belonging to that period of my life is also like one of those little balloons that has been filled with oxygen or some other gas: when I manage to puncture it and free what it contains, I can breathe the Combray air from that year, that day, mingled with the scent of hawthorns gusted from the corner of the square by the wind, announcing rain, and at times driving the sunlight away, at others letting it spread out on the red wool carpet of the sacristy and tingeing it brightly to an almost geranium pink with that Wagnerian softness of brio which preserves the nobility of a festive occasion.""",3.1,3,5,4
"23","22,""Yet even apart from rare moments such as this one, when we can suddenly feel the original entity give a stir and resume its shape, chisel itself out of syllables that have become lifeless, if in the dizzy whirl of daily life where they serve merely the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that revolves too fast and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, we reflect upon the past in our day-dreams and seek to grasp it by slowing down and suspending the perpetual motion in which we are carried along, we can see the gradual reappearance, side by side but utterly distinct from one another, of the successive tints which a single name assumed for us in the course of our existence.""",-0.55,-1,-1,0
"24","23,""Of course, what shape this name Guermantes projected for me when my nurse knowing no more, probably, than I today in whose honour it had been composed rocked me to sleep with that old song, Gloire a la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, several years later, the veteran Marechal de Guermantes filled my nursery-maid with pride by stopping in the Champs-Elysees and exclaiming A fine child you have there!, giving me a chocolate drop from his pocket bonbonniere, I cannot now say.""",2.8,2,1,10
"25","24,""Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer with me; they are external to me; all I can know about them, as with what we can know about events that took place before we were born, comes from other peoples accounts.""",0.6,0,-1,1
"26","25,""But after these earliest years, I can find a succession of seven or eight different figures spanning the time this name inhabited me; the first ones were the finest: gradually my dream, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, took up its position afresh, a little further back, until it was obliged to retreat even further.""",-0.85,0,-1,-1
"27","26,""And as Mme de Guermantes changed, so did her dwelling-place, itself born from that name fertilized from year to year by hearing some word or other that modified my dreams of it; the dwelling-place itself mirrored them in its very masonry which had become as much a mirror as the surface of a cloud or of a lake.""",0,-1,1,0
"28","27,""A two-dimensional castle keep which was really no more than a strip of orange light where the lord and his lady, high up, decided upon life or death for their vassals, had been replaced right at the end of the Guermantes way along which I used to follow the course of the Vivonne with my parents on all those sunny afternoons by the land of bubbling streams where the Duchesse taught me to fish for trout and to recognize the names of the flowers whose purple and reddish clusters adorned the low walls of the neighbouring garden plots; then it had become the hereditary property, the poetic domain from which the proud race of the Guermantes, like a mellowing, crenellated tower spanning the ages, was rising already over France, at a time when the sky was still empty in those places where Notre-Dame de Paris and Notre-Dame de Chartres were later to rise; a time when on the summit of the hill in Laon the cathedral nave had not been placed there like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, full of Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God has been appeased, carrying with it the species of plants that will multiply on earth, brimming over with animals spilling out even from the towers where oxen, moving calmly around on the roofs, gaze down over the plains of Champagne; a time when the traveller who left Beauvais at close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with the bends in the road, the black branching wings of the cathedral spread out against the golden screen of sunset.""",2.15,0,4,7
"29","28,""It was, this Guermantes, like the setting of a novel, an imaginary landscape I could picture to myself only with difficulty and thereby longed all the more to discover, set amid real lands and roads which would suddenly become immersed in heraldic details, a few miles from a railway-station; I recalled the names of the places around it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me as the physical conditions necessary in topographical science for the production of an inexplicable phenomenon.""",0.1,0,4,1
"30","29,""I remembered the coats of arms painted beneath the windows of the church in Combray, their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordly domains which this illustrious house had appropriated by marriage or gain from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France: vast territories in the north, powerful cities in the south, assembled together to compose the name Guermantes and, losing their material form, to inscribe allegorically their sinople keep or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field.""",2.45,2,1,4
"31","30,""I had heard of the famous Guermantes tapestries and could see them, medieval and blue, somewhat coarse, standing out like a cloud against the amaranth, legendary name beneath the ancient forest where Childebert so often went hunting, and it seemed to me that, without making a journey to see them, I might just as easily penetrate the secrets of the mysterious corners of these lands, this remoteness of the centuries, simply by coming into contact for a moment, in Paris, with Mme de Guermantes, the suzerain of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face and her words must possess the local charm of forests and streams and the same age-old characteristics as those recorded in the book of ancient customs in her archives.""",2.05,1,7,4
"32","31,But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the house had borne the name Guermantes only since the seventeenth century when his family had acquired it.",0.8,1,0,1
"33","32,""They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood and their title did not belong to the area.""",0,0,0,1
"34","33,""The village of Guermantes had taken its name from the chateau and had been built after it, and, so that the village should not destroy the view from it, building regulations that were still in force dictated the lines of its streets and set limits on the height of its houses.""",-1.25,-2,-4,0
"35","34,""As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, acquired in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with artistic tastes and hung, along with mediocre hunting-scenes which he had painted himself, in a particularly ugly drawing-room done out in adrinople and plush.""",0.4,-2,-3,-1
"36","35,""By revealing these things to me, Saint-Loup had introduced into the chateau elements that were foreign to the name Guermantes, and they no longer made it possible for me to go on extracting from its syllables alone the style in which it was built.""",-0.25,1,-3,0
"37","36,""Then, the chateau reflected in its lake had disappeared from the depths of this name, and what had appeared to me around Mme de Guermantes as her dwelling had been her Paris house, the Hotel de Guermantes, as limpid as its name, for no physical and opaque element intervened to disrupt and darken its transparency.""",-1.9,-2,-4,-2
"38","37,""Just as the word church signifies not merely the building but also the company of the faithful, the Hotel de Guermantes included all those who shared in the life of the Duchesse, but these close friends I had never seen were for me merely famous and poetic names, and, knowing only persons who were themselves merely names as well, they only enlarged and protected the mystery surrounding the Duchesse by extending around her a vast halo, which at best grew dimmer as it increased in size.""",6.25,3,11,7
"39","38,""In the parties she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having bodies, moustaches, boots, as making any remark that was banal, or even original in a human and rational manner, this whirl of names, introducing less physical presence than a banquet of ghosts or a ball of spectres around the statuette in Dresden china known as Mme de Guermantes, maintained a show-case transparency around her glass mansion.""",0.5,0,0,2
"40","39,""Then, when Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousins chaplain and her gardeners, the Hotel de Guermantes had become as some Louvre might have become in the past a kind of castle surrounded, in the very centre of Paris, by its lands, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had oddly survived and over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges.""",4.8,3,6,2
"41","40,But this last dwelling had itself faded away by the time we had come to live right next to Mme de Villeparisis in one of the apartments adjoining the one occupied by Mme de Guermantes in a wing of the Hotel.",0.8,1,0,0
"42","41,""It was one of those old houses, some of which may still exist, in which the main courtyard was often flanked alluvial deposits washed up by the rising tide of democracy or the legacy of bygone days when the various trades were grouped around the seigneurial dwelling by the backs of shops, premises like a bootmakers or a tailors, for instance (like those you see clustered around cathedrals when restorers have not had the aesthetic sense to remove them), together with a concierge who was also a cobbler, kept chickens and grew flowers and, at the far end, in the main house, lived an aristocratic lady who, when she drove out in her old carriage and pair, her hat sporting a few nasturtiums which seemed to have escaped from the concierges garden (with a footman at her coachmans side who got down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), dispensed smiles and little waves of the hand indiscriminately to the porters children and to any middle-class tenants who happened to be passing and between whom her disdainful affability and her egalitarian hauteur could not distinguish.""",2.3,1,4,6
"43","42,""In the house to which we had moved, the aristocratic lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchesse, elegant and still young.""",1.15,1,2,3

"45","44,""For the Guermantes (often referred to by Francoise as the people below or downstairs) constantly occupied her thoughts from morning when, as she did Mamas hair, unable to resist casting a forbidden, furtive glance into the courtyard, would remark: Oh, there go two holy Sisters: theyll be for downstairs, or Oh! just look at those pheasants in the kitchen window.""",-1.85,-1,-4,-1

"47","46,""The Duc will have been out hunting to evening when, handing me my night-clothes, she might chance to hear the sound of a piano or a snatch of song and would conclude: Gay goings-on below, theyve got company; and in the steady set of her face, beneath her now whitened hair, a smile from her younger days, lively and demure, would for a second set each one of her features in its place and match them together in a carefully ordered readiness, as if to dance a quadrille.""",4.6,3,8,4
"48","47,""But the moment in the Guermantes day that most aroused Francoises curiosity, that gave her most satisfaction and also most annoyance, was the moment when the doors of the carriage entrance opened and the Duchesse stepped into her barouche.""",0.3,-1,-2,0
"49","48,""This usually happened shortly after our servants had finished celebrating the solemn Passover feast that none might disturb, otherwise known as their midday meal, during which they were so taboo that not even my father would have dared to ring for them, in the full knowledge that not a single one of them would have stirred even if the bell had rung five times, and that he would have committed this breach of etiquette to no effect whatsoever, but not without detriment to himself.""",-0.65,-5,-2,1
"50","49,""For Francoise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity to assume a suitable expression) would not have failed to present him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with little red cuneiform markings, which was her way, indecipherable though it was, of displaying to the outside world the long record of her grievances and the underlying causes of her displeasure.""",-1.75,-3,-4,2
"51","50,""She would enlarge upon these by addressing herself to no one in particular, but not in a way that made what she said at all clear.""",0.5,1,0,0
"52","51,""And this is what she meant in the belief that for us it was exasperating, mortifying, vexing as she put it when she talked about saying low mass for us the whole blessed day.""",-1.5,-3,-4,1
"53","52,""The last rites completed, Francoise, who was at once, as in the early church, both celebrant and a member of the faithful, poured herself a final glass of wine, removed the napkin from her neck and, wiping the traces of red liquid and coffee from her lips, folded it up and slipped it into its ring; she directed a doleful look of thanks to her young footman, who was ingratiating himself with her by a Come, Madame, a few more grapes, theyre eavenly, then went straight to open the window on the pretext that it was too hot in this wretched kitchen.""",1.7,1,6,2
"54","53,""As she turned the window-knob and let in the air, she managed, at the same time, to steal a skilfully indifferent glance towards the back of the courtyard; from this she gained the stealthy assurance that the Duchesse was not yet ready to leave, and gazed longingly for a moment with scornful and impassioned eyes at the waiting carriage; once this second of attention had been paid to the things of this earth, she raised her eyes to heaven, whose purity she had already anticipated as she felt the mildness of the air and the warmth of the sun; at the corner of the roof, her gaze rested on the place where, each spring, there came to nest, immediately above my bedroom chimney, two pigeons like the ones that used to coo in her kitchen in Combray.""",3,3,1,1

Jupiens benefit, the grumpy face of our old cook, weighed down by age, bad temper and the heat of the stove, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and demureness that she gracefully acknowledged the waistcoat-maker, but without a word to him; if she was infringing Mamas instructions by looking into the courtyard, she would not have dared to challenge them to the point of talking from the window, which would have entailed, as Francoise saw it, a whole lecture on the subject from her mistress.""",2.45,-1,1,1
"67","66,""She pointed out the waiting carriage to Jupien with a gesture that seemed to convey: A fine pair of horses there all right! but what she actually muttered was: What an old crate!, and she did this mainly because she knew what his response was going to be: he would put his hand to his lips so that he would be audible without having to shout: You could have one too if you wanted, more than just one perhaps, but youre not interested in that sort of thing.""",1.65,3,4,1
"68","67,""And Francoise, after a modest, furtive and delighted gesture that conveyed something like: Each to his own; but simplicitys the thing in this house, closed the window in case Mama should enter the room.""",2,3,5,1
"69","68,""The you who might have owned more horses than the Guermantes meant us, but Jupien was right to use you in this way because, apart from a few strictly personal indulgences (like pretending with an irritating giggle that she did not have a cold when she was coughing all the time and the whole household lived in fear of catching it), Francoise, like those plants that are completely attached to a particular animal and nourished by that animal with food it catches, eats and digests for them, offering it to them in its final and easily assimilable residue, lived with us symbiotically; we were the ones who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, our position, had to take it upon ourselves to devise the little ways of humouring her which constituted along with the recognized right freely to practise the ritual of the midday meal according to ancient custom, including a breath of air at the window afterwards, a certain amount of lingering when she went out to shop and a Sunday visit to her niece the portion of contentment without which her life could not be lived.""",3.05,-1,0,4
"70","69,""So one can understand why Francoise had pined away during the first days of our move, a prey to a sickness in a house where my fathers claims to distinction were not yet known which she herself called ennui in the strong sense in which the word is used by Corneille, or in the letters of soldiers who end up by committing suicide because they pine too much for their fiancees or for their native villages.""",-1.7,0,-3,-1

"208","207,""It is true that she had once appeared to me, in the church at Combray, in a momentary flash of transfiguration, with cheeks that were irreducible to, impervious to, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, dislocating my shattered dream, like a god or a nymph changed into a swan or a willow and henceforth subjected to natural laws, gliding over the water or shaken by the wind.""",0.5,0,5,3
"209","208,""Yet scarcely had I left her presence than these vanished glints had come together again like the pink and green reflections of sunset behind the oar that has disturbed them, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had been quick to appropriate my memory of the face.""",0.65,0,2,0
"210","209,""But now I often saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street; and if I did not manage to match the name Guermantes with her person, to think of her as Mme de Guermantes, I could at least put the blame on the failure of my mind to carry out completely the act I demanded of it; but she too, our neighbour, seemed to be committing the same error, and committing it without a qualm, without any of my misgivings, without even suspecting that it was an error.""",-4.5,-5,-7,-1

"212","211,""But like a traveller who is disappointed by his first impression of a city and who tells himself that he might perhaps penetrate its charm by visiting its museums, getting to know its inhabitants and working in its libraries, I assured myself that, had I been a regular visitor to Mme de Guermantess house, were I one of her circle, were I to enter into her life, I should then know what was really enclosed within the brilliant orange-coloured envelope of her name, know it objectively, through the eyes of others, since, after all, my fathers friend had said that the Guermantes were an exclusive set in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.""",3.45,3,10,7
"213","212,""The life I supposed them to be living stemmed from a source so different from anything I knew and must, it seemed to me, be so special, that I could not have imagined the presence at the Duchesses parties of the sort of people I had frequented so far, of people who really existed.""",1.2,0,0,2
"214","213,""For, incapable of suddenly changing their nature, they would have conducted conversations there in a way that was familiar to me; their partners would perhaps have stooped to answer them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading salon of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments I had already experienced: but this was impossible.""",0.8,0,0,2
"215","214,""It is true that my mind was hampered by certain difficulties, and the presence of the body of Jesus Christ in the sacrament seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading salon of the Faubourg Saint-Germain being situated on the right bank and the fact that, every morning, from my bedroom, I could hear its carpets being beaten.""",0.25,-1,3,2
"216","215,""But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal; I had a strong sense of it already being the Faubourg when I saw, spread out on the other side of this Equator, the Guermantes door-mat of which my mother had been bold enough to say, having like myself caught sight of it one day when their door was open, that it was in a dreadful state.""",1.6,4,3,4
"217","216,""Besides, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery with its red plush furniture, which I could sometimes see from our kitchen window, have failed to possess for me the mysterious spell of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form an essential part of it, to be geographically located within it, when to be invited into that dining-room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its air, since the people who sat down beside Mme de Guermantes on the leather sofa in the gallery before proceeding to table all belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain?""",0.2,-1,-2,4
"218","217,""No doubt, outside the Faubourg, at certain parties, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashionable people, one might occasionally see one of those men who are no more than names and who, when one tries to picture them, assume in turn the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest.""",0.05,-1,-1,-1

"222","221,""As for the tiny patch of garden that lay behind high walls at the back of the house, where in summer Mme de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade served to her guests after dinner, how could I have failed to feel that to sit there between nine and eleven at night on its wrought-iron chairs they had the same magic power as the leather sofa and not to breath in the air peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig and not to be in Africa?""",0.7,-1,-2,2

"477","476,""Compared with these romantic ideas of mine, the image of Mme de Guermantes at the Opera was very insignificant, a tiny star beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been very familiar with these ideas long before I knew Mme de Guermantes; by contrast, the memory of her was something I possessed imperfectly; it was during the hours when, instead of floating around in my mind like images of other pretty women, it gradually developed into a unique and definitive association utterly distinct from every other feminine image with the romantic ideas I had held for so long before it appeared, it was during those few hours when I remembered it best that I ought to have decided to discover exactly what it was; but at that point I was still unaware of the importance it was to assume for me; I cherished it simply as a first encounter with Mme de Guermantes inside myself, the first, the only true sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme de Guermantes; yet during the few hours I was fortunate enough to be able to hold it there without conscious attention, this memory must have been really charming, since it was always to it, still freely then, unhurriedly and untiring, with no trace of compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as these ideas came to fix it more securely, it acquired greater strength from them but became less clear itself; soon I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I no doubt distorted it completely, because each time I saw Mme de Guermantes, I realized that there was a gap, always a different sort of gap, between what I had imagined and what I saw.""",7.35,4,17,8
"478","477,""It is true that every morning now, at the moment when Mme de Guermantes appeared at the top of the street, I went on seeing her tall figure, the face with its bright eyes beneath the fine hair, all the things for which I stood waiting; but by contrast, a few minutes later when I directed my gaze elsewhere so as to seem not to be expecting the encounter I had come to seek and raised my eyes to the Duchesse the moment we drew level in the street, what my eyes then encountered were red patches (it was not clear whether they were caused by the fresh air or by a blotchy complexion) on a sullen face which gave a distinctly curt nod, far removed from the friendly gesture of the Phedre evening, in response to the greeting which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise and which did not seem to please her.""",3.65,3,11,5

"924","923,""And indeed at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends the beginning of the festive season was attracting a great many people from near and far; as I hastened across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, and lobsters were being flung alive into what the landlord called the everlasting fire, I discovered an influx of new arrivals (worthy of some Census of the People at Bethlehem such as the Old Flemish Masters painted), gathering there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if they did not like the look of them; would recommend accommodation elsewhere in the town) for board and lodging, while a kitchen-boy passed by holding a struggling fowl by its neck.""",6.1,7,10,7
"925","924,""Similarly, in the big dining-room, which I had passed through on my first day here on my way to the small room where my friend awaited me, one was again reminded of some Biblical feast, portrayed with the naivety of former times and with Flemish exaggeration, because of the quantity of fish, chickens, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid along the floor in their haste to set them down on the huge sideboard where they were carved immediately, but where for many of the diners were finishing their meal as I arrived they piled up untouched; it was as if their profusion and the haste of those who carried them in were prompted far less by the demands of those eating than by respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed to the letter but naively illustrated by real details taken from local custom, and by a concern, both aesthetic and devotional, to make visible the splendour of the feast through the profusion of its victuals and the bustling attentiveness of those who served it.""",-1.05,-3,5,4

"6671","6670,""It appears that some of her sisters shared the same voice; she detested them, and they less intelligent than herself and married to men somewhat below their station (if one can use such an expression to refer to unions with obscure noblemen, burrowed away in the provinces or in one of the lacklustre circles of the Faubourg Saint-Germain in Paris) possessed this voice themselves but had curbed it, corrected it, toned it down as far as they were able to do so, just as any one of us seldom has the nerve to be himself as opposed to putting his efforts into aping the most fashionable models of the done thing.""",-1.1,1,3,2
"6672","6671,""But Oriane was far more intelligent, far wealthier and, most importantly, so much more fashionable than her sisters; as the Princesse des Laumes, she had commanded such an impressive dash in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she came to realize that her discordant voice was an attraction, and, with audacious confidence in her own idiosyncrasy, she had used it to create, in the world of society, what in the theatrical world a Rejane or a Jeanne Granier (and of course no comparison is implied here between the respective merits and talents of these two actresses) created with theirs, something admirable and distinctive which certain sisters of Rejane and Granier, utterly unknown to the world, possibly tried to conceal as a defect.""",3.5,3,11,4
"6673","6672,""In support of all these reasons for cultivating her native idiosyncrasies, Mme de Guermantess favourite writers Merimee, Meilhac and Halevy had contributed, together with a respect for naturalness, an inclination towards the prosaic through which she attained to poetry and a purely society cast of mind which called up various landscapes before my eyes.""",1.1,2,6,2
"6674","6673,""Besides, the Duchesse was quite capable, by bringing an artful refinement of her own to these various influences, of having selected for most of her words the pronunciation she thought of as most Ile-de-France, most Champenoise, since, if not to the same degree as her sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely strayed beyond the pure choice of words that might have been used by an old-established French writer.""",2.65,3,2,4
"6675","6674,""And when one was tired of the composite hotchpotch of modern speech, it was very restful to listen to Mme de Guermantess talk, even with the knowledge that it could express far fewer things almost as restful, if one was alone in her company and she restrained and clarified the flow of her speech still further, as listening to an old song.""",1.5,1,-2,4
