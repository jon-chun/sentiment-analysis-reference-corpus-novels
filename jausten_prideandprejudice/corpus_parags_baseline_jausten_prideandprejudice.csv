64,64,2,"An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do
credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred
it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,
and consequently unable to accept the honour of their
invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could
not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his
arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be
always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to
get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that
Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with
him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of
ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,
that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from
London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered

76,76,2,"Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a
most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had
been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her
quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,
my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only
creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,
he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;
but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,
you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,
and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with

visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennets pleasing
manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and
though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger
sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted
with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this
attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth
still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,
hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though
their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration.
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire
her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to
the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the
first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she
considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered
by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength
of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of

121,121,5,"It may perhaps be pleasant, replied Charlotte, to be able to
impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her
affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose

consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so
much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it
is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freelya
slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us
who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection
than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may
never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.",it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,821,156,5.7,1.5571983428686056,2.2,1.5571983428686056,0.3647667994937508,6.7,1.9054770227484832,2.6444444444444444,1.9054770227484832,0.4423076923076924,99.17591415085259,1.6676118718913493,1.7504506775126876,1.6676118718913493,0.6379036226105954,1.885416666666667,1.0225670167694043,1.2217898832684824,1.0225670167694043,0.15329554020582958,7.296000000000001,1.263243895215913,1.5730929264909852,1.263243895215913,0.05071261713870893,46.512072917030494,1.5219928143965142,1.8161027455432237,1.5219928143965142,0.2789686547020723,3.8836037302490927,2.537613040150761,2.637883306151205,2.537613040150761,0.7310299555423958,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.658, 'pos': 0.22, 'compound': 0.9714}",0.9714,1.2227598505038435,0.6809870406532932,1.2227598505038435,0.012696325824091538,0.1346031746031746,0.09907595062111044,0.18823529411764706,0.09907595062111044,-0.019226004657846484,0.8135936399708786,2.3634406271351573,2.316584221644662,2.3634406271351573,0.5481990072553424,30.87464965548029,-0.9977,-1.0137131714009604,-0.1755492322284601,-1.0137131714009604,-0.02529644806187101

advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss

439,439,12,"Dear Sir,
The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have
had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal
the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,
fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to
be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him
to be at variance.There, Mrs. Bennet.My mind, however, is now
made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,
I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage
of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir
Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to
the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are
highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in
the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your

fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourghs attention
to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very
remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins
was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than
usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he
protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour
in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension, as he had
himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously
pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already
had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him
twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday
before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady
Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had
never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken
to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the
smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a
week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to
advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with
discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble
parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations
he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some
herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs.",during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs,1685,294,16.4,5.351098185362129,6.955555555555555,5.351098185362129,0.7593775456274574,16.4,5.3843459837753285,6.955555555555555,5.3843459837753285,0.6989795918367349,179.54450186472823,3.2345037008532675,3.1689528412588848,3.2345037008532675,0.6127710435684239,1.725,0.9101758552775504,1.1019455252918289,0.9101758552775504,-0.030290411181675508,21.024,4.952039534851098,5.381137309292649,4.952039534851098,0.4344969369975562,108.3936209219453,4.295817475517723,4.701636038268071,4.295817475517723,0.44077850851957934,4.668388971217402,3.130191701888623,3.2157728423138026,3.130191701888623,0.3987995192544924,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.9929}",0.9929,1.2616683898710472,0.7064323332741582,1.2616683898710472,-0.16173135369803074,0.2993333333333333,0.8085437719159956,0.8665359477124183,0.8085437719159956,0.011025929622629459,1.0611367388448285,3.2722738324745366,3.1292241447710896,3.2722738324745366,0.2750941450887832,52.38969845477306,0.9653,1.1257572768055009,0.8308851803429977,1.1257572768055009,0.1845849851578304

instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These

479,479,14,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike
appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the
way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return
from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.
All were struck with the strangers air, all wondered who he
could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find
out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached
the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned
with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had
accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it
should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him
completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he
had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good
figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed
up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness
at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole
party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley
were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of
the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,
and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on
his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy
corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to
fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by
the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the
countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all
astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few
moments, touched his hata salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was
impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.",but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to enquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know,2258,392,14.55,4.695143539697361,6.133333333333333,4.695143539697361,0.3766373131011038,15.55,5.079496641829676,6.5777777777777775,5.079496641829676,0.37670068027210896,129.10144830064962,2.251049708370118,2.27863508575281,2.251049708370118,0.33045969820752225,8.142857142857142,5.406656386651084,5.8966092273485256,5.406656386651084,0.4097393176168408,11.869000000000002,2.4920363238327328,2.8416088765603327,2.4920363238327328,-0.20509996579766232,106.44118273514594,4.208299930038276,4.610593949444609,4.208299930038276,0.21789678288066344,4.611891356174215,3.0875312651653712,3.174169893064509,3.0875312651653712,0.24720887332508526,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9971}",0.9971,1.2692691277939427,0.7114030416000947,1.2692691277939427,-0.21275436466662065,0.17375730994152047,0.26770687593142284,0.34945820433436525,0.26770687593142284,-0.10095943739235112,1.1206293851219515,3.490695968482828,3.324527910932017,3.490695968482828,0.1474620485108275,65.88416223106023,0.9982,1.1616149323052425,0.8477530826219591,1.1616149323052425,0.16860553625280414

eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and
she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return
home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she
should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see
Mr. Joness shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they
were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the
Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Janes introduction of him. She received
him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much
more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering
himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the
young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was
quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her
contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by
exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny
had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenants commission in the shire. She had been watching him
the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and
had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have
continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now
except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the
stranger, were become stupid, disagreeable fellows. Some of
them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their
aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give
him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come
in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested
that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect
of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual

Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking
me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite
forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was
the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcys steward. Let me
recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit
confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcys using him
ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always
been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the
least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not
well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the
way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,
indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourites guilt; but

in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of
your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a
wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst
the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me
leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in
point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided
that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time
maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of
my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I
look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted
by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a
young lady like yourself. And with a low bow he left her to
attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly

all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology,
Hunsford, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. It vexed her to see
him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with
unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him
time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.
Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and

616,616,17,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she
turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.
Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her
observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as
Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the
felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she
felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to
like Bingleys two sisters. Her mothers thoughts she plainly saw
were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near
her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,
therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to
find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)
freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane
would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating
subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a
charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from
them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was
such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,
and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her
younger daughters, as Janes marrying so greatly must throw them
in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at
her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to
the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go
into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this
circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it
is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to
find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be
equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
there was no chance of it.",as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it,2048,369,21.200000000000006,7.053034563303151,9.08888888888889,7.053034563303151,0.7936276114379162,22.5,7.5720883200911775,9.666666666666666,7.5720883200911775,0.8028455284552847,245.8956043866003,4.5281061311244954,4.34004698601728,4.5281061311244954,0.6686484678722578,6.3270833333333325,4.134488527167225,4.540077821011671,4.134488527167225,0.30269246426608504,25.033000000000005,6.029281792958432,6.4932038834951475,6.029281792958432,0.37756606541093995,119.39545927297189,4.788972083306834,5.214651175519371,4.788972083306834,0.33726444898377483,7.483159143315957,5.25557920232605,5.288475212648054,5.25557920232605,0.5609600843037662,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.749, 'pos': 0.216, 'compound': 0.9977}",0.9977,1.2703549474972138,0.7121131427895142,1.2703549474972138,-0.20295044177902133,0.2081090407177364,0.4156545728157119,0.4909065075305484,0.4156545728157119,-0.07744300786962473,1.6836348126308178,5.557721991966922,5.1727744967257046,5.557721991966922,0.4372168150393632,63.85629135629616,-0.9576,-0.9700082478283272,-0.15498987413161067,-0.9700082478283272,0.05711332163215248

621,621,17,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady
Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights
which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts
of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not
long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,
singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing
Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the
company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she
endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;
Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting
was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeths eyes
were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched
her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which
was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she
might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of
half a minute began another. Marys powers were by no means
fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner
affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see
how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of

sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there
are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a
parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an
agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the
time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and
the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be
excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not
think it of light importance that he should have attentive and
conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those
to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of
testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family. And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.

Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins

638,638,18,"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to
set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am
convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
thirdlywhich perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it
is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble
lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she
condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this
subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
Hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourghs footstool, that she said, Mr.
Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose
properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,
let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,
but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and
I will visit her. Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair
cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady
Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my
power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can
describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable
to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my
views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own
neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable
young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit
this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,
however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself
without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the
melancholy event takes placewhich, however, as I have already
said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my
fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the
most animated language of the violence of my affection. To
fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of
that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could
not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four
per cents, which will not be yours till after your mothers
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure
yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when
we are married.",my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married,2703,492,21.25,7.070763067240035,9.111111111111109,7.070763067240035,0.5011836513369421,20.25,6.765134179646808,8.666666666666666,6.765134179646808,0.4065040650406505,277.83648167463986,5.150835745469376,4.903802115152308,5.150835745469376,0.5666274665244385,2.2941416666666665,1.3089280192468562,1.5271408560311281,1.3089280192468562,-0.06584815953664144,19.28399999999999,4.484491136470762,4.8984743411927845,4.484491136470762,-0.066777675767442,117.29496536397184,4.694817977710501,5.116705256243012,4.694817977710501,0.14189332736853225,5.08059190804429,3.4414394827055914,3.5193052630737016,3.4414394827055914,0.1941972180916849,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9943}",0.9943,1.264201969178679,0.7080892360494704,1.264201969178679,-0.24474747827617535,0.2127945834653152,0.4358344951221925,0.5101999188441083,0.4358344951221925,-0.10305333615748542,1.5695596887837049,5.138904982213601,4.798286174104519,5.138904982213601,0.2038186264542272,79.38424856319202,-0.738,-0.7306665716051285,-0.042400471686021166,-0.7306665716051285,0.08086054945444528

the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I
have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps
not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had

observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any
disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my
pretensions to your daughters favour, without having paid
yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be
objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your
daughters lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to
error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My

and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings
necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish
allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_
feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or
dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner

701,701,20,"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen
you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,
cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as
much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her
wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or
grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss
Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been
_one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a
second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare
say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss
Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is
in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he
took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to
persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very
much in love with her friend.",indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend,991,189,2.15,0.29847456334972605,0.6222222222222222,0.29847456334972605,-0.15121678131451233,7.15,2.0668678508373572,2.8444444444444437,2.0668678508373572,0.3399470899470899,64.08462230765015,0.9834607623485984,1.1310908651262133,0.9834607623485984,0.34022441773130496,-0.8375000000000004,-0.8851634776442697,-0.8124513618677044,-0.8851634776442697,-0.33432254291514285,4.6549999999999985,0.5535914123869116,0.8404993065187238,0.5535914123869116,-0.2927189713448691,45.92649381388914,1.4957443799326295,1.7887972231037377,1.4957443799326295,0.15243018126341207,1.3104327068027282,0.594653155208086,0.743086447622484,0.594653155208086,0.06917260437453653,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.695, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.986}",0.986,1.2491814632834328,0.6982661695958341,1.2491814632834328,-0.0491241404440388,0.1338659147869674,0.09590068435799944,0.18519951840385265,0.09590068435799944,-0.049332985106341515,0.705660872529728,1.9671747508457111,1.9622601615711392,1.9671747508457111,0.29623920376498625,36.504911118076,-0.8955,-0.9023255606996357,-0.12315106770232508,-0.9023255606996357,0.010643908062407571

have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave
Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the
fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape
out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,
and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was
anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction
that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture
his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till
its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably
encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure
of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering
kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked
towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally
in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love
and eloquence awaited her there.",the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there,1726,305,8.15,2.4258950357760014,3.2888888888888888,2.4258950357760014,0.16345819273725273,12.15,3.860099274047071,5.066666666666666,3.860099274047071,0.3800546448087432,193.44340608201276,3.505481206730572,3.4142679110733467,3.505481206730572,0.6363961530528548,5.3375,3.4411664270551414,3.8007782101167313,3.4411664270551414,0.3131264333965309,12.095000000000002,2.5527638744269603,2.904299583911235,2.5527638744269603,-0.059632560596857474,95.4179548927314,3.7141865437341863,4.09658142134734,3.7141865437341863,0.3126730383472698,2.7489936302563853,1.6808872767834904,1.802394474071268,1.6808872767834904,0.14580310546607333,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.223, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.9956,1.266554578535766,0.709627788626546,1.266554578535766,-0.16864480986505856,0.22399999999999995,0.4840945254460083,0.5563398692810455,0.4840945254460083,-0.04424080107811198,0.946719866473274,2.852202122395086,2.7536139225861764,2.852202122395086,0.18916678563662676,54.46443629945463,0.7252,0.8640726845414297,0.7077853828603656,0.8640726845414297,0.16494683958277812

714,714,21,"Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.
Collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for
their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his
prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas
began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter
had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was
likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,
that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and
his wife should make their appearance at St. Jamess. The whole
family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The
younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner
than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of Charlottes dying an old maid.
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her
point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in
general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither
sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his
attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her
husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,
marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision
for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;
and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any
other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame
her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings
must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her
the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when
he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of
course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without
difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst
forth in such very direct questions on his return as required
some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising
great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous
love.",sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love,2500,421,26.600000000000005,8.967712988486799,11.48888888888889,8.967712988486799,0.9111325288247002,27.600000000000005,9.401184371765089,11.933333333333335,9.401184371765089,0.8944972288202697,184.40413502941811,3.329248671669648,3.25472516045985,3.329248671669648,0.4395031722496263,7.272762698412698,4.797050619053866,5.246577580137112,4.797050619053866,0.3064831660148862,31.88400000000001,7.8701864350869775,8.393619972260751,7.8701864350869775,0.5000163432416385,174.45772590617352,7.257124190171963,7.78220174051779,7.257124190171963,0.545628353640415,8.130433678790082,5.744325751044268,5.7651064762705415,5.744325751044268,0.5253135663310876,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.9966}",0.9966,1.268364278041217,0.7108112906089118,1.268364278041217,-0.2235517050005324,0.1938811188811189,0.35437707035476834,0.4323209470268293,0.35437707035476834,-0.09759591910014198,1.2758586979908164,4.0606070450549,3.834118109368357,4.0606070450549,0.1766756007949425,70.40955565832209,-0.9731,-0.9869016721519136,-0.1629367581840088,-0.9869016721519136,0.06326567385398693

she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all
reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness
of Mr. Collinss making two offers of marriage within three days
was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had
always felt that Charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly
like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,
when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins
was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend
disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the
distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to
be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.",elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen,924,162,3.15,0.6530446420874386,1.0666666666666669,0.6530446420874386,0.014240145325581743,3.15,0.6322827122695862,1.0666666666666669,0.6322827122695862,-0.027777777777777752,-32.853689533007675,-0.9064797362607232,-0.5798662265353102,-0.9064797362607232,-0.2034897736886764,3.854166666666667,2.401913089623973,2.6926070038910503,2.401913089623973,0.4988525654902261,8.107999999999999,1.4814331477934015,1.7983356449375862,1.4814331477934015,0.10159464461789533,19.883882981376125,0.3283909685171677,0.5744316648807153,0.3283909685171677,-0.12345824357051252,2.120442549720331,1.2062785065186787,1.3395505348334398,1.2062785065186787,0.2960013270827941,"{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9398}",0.9398,1.1655733461315816,0.6435883780105331,1.1655733461315816,-0.013359589233409628,0.09702380952380953,-0.06277267791190562,0.033496732026143734,-0.06277267791190562,-0.0706384993585826,0.34002953928565943,0.6247907454894345,0.7619575884367062,0.6247907454894345,0.018258620935874048,30.264498209644728,-0.9999,-1.0161109477565662,-0.17667717706170372,-1.0161109477565662,-0.02045449169136991

anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that
want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his
designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,
however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to
sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her
sisters was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible
himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing
else; and yet whether Bingleys regard had really died away, or
were suppressed by his friends interference; whether he had been
aware of Janes attachment, or whether it had escaped his

Jane; but this may be from better feelings than you are
supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known
me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their
own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their
brothers. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,
unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed
him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,
they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do
not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistakenor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison

herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt
that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she
might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with
comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The

831,831,25,"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to
have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingleys regard for me. But,
my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not
think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her
behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I
do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate
with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am
sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit
till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the
meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no
pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and
was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went
away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no
longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very
wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every
advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because
she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am
very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need
not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to
be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account
for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his
sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural
and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such
fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have
met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner
of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is
really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were
not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say
that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I
will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of
what will make me happyyour affection, and the invariable
kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to
Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that
you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.

will be very comfortable there.Yours, etc.",my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the because of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable thereyours etc,2586,488,6.1,1.6990263743636904,2.3777777777777778,1.6990263743636904,-0.12816130793023695,6.9,1.9772062796768712,2.733333333333333,1.9772062796768712,-0.13387978142076504,13.907595752836766,0.005193317980302961,0.24546847504824745,0.005193317980302961,0.028596026528448712,4.567857142857143,2.901939073404057,3.2257921067259585,2.901939073404057,0.07282970653257058,18.152999999999995,4.180584677523546,4.584743411927876,4.180584677523546,-0.09774526856894328,74.11838311477081,2.7594386524187344,3.1033835220122032,2.7594386524187344,-0.056602289022741274,0.9538472418119116,0.3254012291923613,0.4805088681669745,0.3254012291923613,-0.11429441040296652,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.689, 'pos': 0.206, 'compound': 0.9961}",0.9961,1.2674594282884917,0.7102195396177289,1.2674594282884917,-0.2435077803178431,0.1602252252252252,0.2094262384619092,0.2937378555025612,0.2094262384619092,-0.1233470894343278,0.9206520893992944,2.756496520009132,2.668038051338549,2.756496520009132,-0.017853964772295988,77.26162658676485,-0.9986,-1.014694079910072,-0.17601066420569614,-1.014694079910072,0.0690140303941312
832,832,25,"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as
she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister
at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely
over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for
him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped

concerning that gentleman, and required information; and
Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to
her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,
his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it
and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but
slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing
that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted
it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering
himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in
this case than in Charlottes, did not quarrel with him for his
wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more
natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few
struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him

all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good
sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness
has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in
love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative
insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.

away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at
first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she
soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned
to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater
certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte
again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty
in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little
change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would
moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew
near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,
however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to

861,861,27,"Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not
help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the
room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself
particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had
lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and
comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of
repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she
could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily
turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a
faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After
sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the
room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of
their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was
large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he
attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of
countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of
the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and
scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked
for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every
direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most
distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with

be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without
any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on
every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not
used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into
Charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a
great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her
how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as
hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her
poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great
ladys attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of
dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she
knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very
genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,
how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than
herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether
they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage
her father kept, and what had been her mothers maiden name?

them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,",when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed,1380,237,8.9,2.691822594829285,3.6222222222222222,2.691822594829285,0.3855654538154381,8.9,2.6944988489607566,3.6222222222222222,2.6944988489607566,0.3343881856540086,92.70316867938445,1.5414171448382734,1.6362069945286857,1.5414171448382734,0.39248194904547096,2.020833333333334,1.1174426725742164,1.3229571984435802,1.1174426725742164,0.048219151949498405,7.635,1.3543352211072537,1.667128987517337,1.3543352211072537,-0.17505104283814296,58.16857906522364,2.0444927397991743,2.3596450073623974,2.0444927397991743,0.15802726919800086,2.6919008207684127,1.6377774183469405,1.7603532435907927,1.6377774183469405,0.232218829072674,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9847}",0.9847,1.246828853926346,0.6967276170187585,1.246828853926346,-0.11413279564312448,0.17797619047619048,0.2858769548308111,0.3668300653594771,0.2858769548308111,-0.041021163533314635,0.6817430627694633,1.879362568611588,1.8837422502524672,1.879362568611588,0.15048970086345995,43.60879329644829,0.9988,1.1622688713113167,0.8480607039401165,1.1622688713113167,0.20477357664369636

promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.",yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really madam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind,490,93,8.75,2.6386370830186285,3.555555555555556,2.6386370830186285,1.5448260880623166,8.75,2.6407019062644657,3.555555555555556,2.6407019062644657,1.4650537634408605,54.119438309421575,0.7891763307679921,0.9552057903014418,0.7891763307679921,0.5839071409803331,0.7062500000000009,0.1964189985305836,0.3408560311284053,0.1964189985305836,0.02068603280577549,9.249,1.7880266665014255,2.114840499306519,1.7880266665014255,0.8679267154096199,75.63623074882798,2.8274757868297518,3.1741606764720065,2.8274757868297518,1.4607741887748291,2.369007464699957,1.3939658596751592,1.52258540338759,1.3939658596751592,0.7523397761786715,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.762, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': 0.9573}",0.9573,1.19724308747698,0.6642996627019351,1.19724308747698,0.2616098891618637,0.12903911564625847,0.07511239218014554,0.16532446311858054,0.07511239218014554,0.08297945071754986,0.503821458689732,1.2261386957972418,1.2996572997141869,1.2261386957972418,0.5825644353877596,20.674974237381445,-0.7527,-0.7466880772539491,-0.04993719398087623,-0.7466880772539491,-0.06211758693605881

determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From

circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her
arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few

in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleys designs on him were, by his
behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by
Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,
and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been
frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.",in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself,858,154,0.2999999999999998,-0.3574800823150421,-0.20000000000000007,-0.3574800823150421,-0.3445375420981692,2.3,0.3274333703239348,0.6888888888888888,0.3274333703239348,-0.11796536796536801,16.564648852803494,0.0569960796050043,0.2923653495449063,0.0569960796050043,0.10792820834115333,-1.6250000000000004,-1.4369019067860973,-1.4007782101167316,-1.4369019067860973,-0.5150175363040242,2.2309999999999994,-0.09775187363258787,0.16809986130374466,-0.09775187363258787,-0.4500522007463344,13.300567294991493,0.03329551613143475,0.2674520045129457,0.03329551613143475,-0.20690270941193245,-0.1946679437007349,-0.5418240396938833,-0.36521920262686136,-0.5418240396938833,-0.2328993064617901,"{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.8655}",0.8655,1.0311126728765476,0.5556541807207528,1.0311126728765476,-0.024444804177285284,0.06433566433566433,-0.20355556386051502,-0.10110151286621884,-0.20355556386051502,-0.10592567020530318,0.3143210886515918,0.5304043792350219,0.6775613219198745,0.5304043792350219,0.008412480899235917,30.17353127361391,0.6879,0.8234194763304766,0.6886615909149171,0.8234194763304766,0.2102497308217116

to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by
their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam
came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which
of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded
by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his
evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George
Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less
captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliams manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.",but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind,1233,211,5.2,1.3799133034997493,1.9777777777777776,1.3799133034997493,0.12087251316643174,5.2,1.367507595785569,1.9777777777777776,1.367507595785569,0.07622432859399689,62.92685770565416,0.960888611383506,1.1106563690157816,0.960888611383506,0.2992450979486597,1.248457142857144,0.5763002903013501,0.7459290717065044,0.5763002903013501,-0.028828740916941136,7.839000000000001,1.4091512402277069,1.7237170596393898,1.4091512402277069,-0.09847607009143056,39.071183482333865,1.188456836708973,1.4691344668958235,1.188456836708973,0.019768975819304774,2.015912412318853,1.1273494878533743,1.2625780467379455,1.1273494878533743,0.16573811424170695,"{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9827}",0.9827,1.2432094549154435,0.6943606130540269,1.2432094549154435,-0.08337572420001822,0.2120748299319728,0.43273462576550586,0.5072362278244631,0.43273462576550586,0.008484488231873933,0.5905146133593652,1.5444251598424596,1.5842554923795855,1.5444251598424596,0.13724193109398067,39.76845395210829,0.9173,1.0734421563195558,0.8062754748904098,1.0734421563195558,0.20765864919931692

difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his
lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity
rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to
himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew
not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliams occasionally
laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally
different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told

set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him

his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the
idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the
subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only

at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could
occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and
even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary
penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal
enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually
thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never
said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of
talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of
their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected
questionsabout her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of
solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collinss
happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly
understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she
came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words
seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his
thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an

1034,1034,33,"When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate
herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her
employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had
written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual
complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any
communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost
every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which
had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding
from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of
uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the
first perusal. Mr. Darcys shameful boast of what misery he had
been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sisters
sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to
Rosings was to end on the day after the nextand, a still

on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of
a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was
moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was
directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near
enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself
called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she
moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it

1070,1070,34,"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common
with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any
other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening
of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his
feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love
before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,
I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucass accidental
information, that Bingleys attentions to your sister had given
rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it
as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
From that moment I observed my friends behaviour attentively;
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was
beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging
as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I
remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny, that though she
received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by
any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken
here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of
your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have
been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment
has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,
that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such
as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,
however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily
touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certainbut I will venture to say that my investigation and
decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did
not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed
it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My
objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last
night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion
to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be
so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other
causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and
existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of
your mothers family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so
almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger
sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It
pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects
of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider
that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of
the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and
your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what
passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and
every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to
preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
returning.",i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning,3392,593,-0.04999999999999993,-0.4815796098732415,-0.3555555555555555,-0.4815796098732415,-0.3862129127678469,0.2999999999999992,-0.3898591989599509,-0.2000000000000004,-0.3898591989599509,-0.4065486228218101,-176.0278646390714,-3.6978494924487135,-3.1068843434091526,-3.6978494924487135,-0.2978517676795521,-6.727726190476191,-5.011975091134282,-5.2129316286825995,-5.011975091134282,-0.5384368854471765,27.13400000000001,6.593833048703883,7.076005547850211,6.593833048703883,0.035013387343402806,79.33991921875034,2.993492681141526,3.346863472869299,2.993492681141526,-0.09809844079018276,0.15419738229505472,-0.2784014659586101,-0.10832647465688973,-0.2784014659586101,-0.17673765230825694,"{'neg': 0.111, 'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.9908}",0.9908,1.2578680209095994,0.70394697911119,1.2578680209095994,-0.26617723528258314,0.12811147186147184,0.07111717102572178,0.16150475341651802,0.07111717102572178,-0.14522100971186996,0.6664230195367792,1.823116347002364,1.833449275770309,1.823116347002364,-0.14756163396871458,91.28485031867241,-0.978,-0.9922421740348536,-0.16544899894896048,-0.9922421740348536,0.07762432219457269
1071,1071,34,"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters
uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence
of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time
was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on
joining him directly in London. We accordingly wentand there I
readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the
certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them
earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or
delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would
ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded
by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sisters
indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection
with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than
on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived
himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against
returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself
for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in
the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it
is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
conceal from him your sisters being in town. I knew it myself,
as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet
ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence
is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough
extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,
and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more
to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
sisters feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives
which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,
I have not yet learnt to condemn them.",the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them,2008,354,3.900000000000001,0.9189722011407234,1.4000000000000006,0.9189722011407234,-0.15857246574419134,3.7,0.8295381688226547,1.3111111111111111,0.8295381688226547,-0.20762711864406774,29.115061196089712,0.3016829542930211,0.5138795949891475,0.3016829542930211,0.08252544974778878,1.1166666666666665,0.4839652168928579,0.6474708171206222,0.4839652168928579,-0.11038072907464194,9.104,1.7490642999697306,2.0746185852981966,1.7490642999697306,-0.27584360409080955,25.205905604359284,0.5669492799140189,0.8225972967752672,0.5669492799140189,-0.2416916684644123,-1.0051435013726109,-1.153801044694469,-0.9620262265665952,-1.153801044694469,-0.2909477713112566,"{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.945}",0.945,1.1749837835599282,0.6497425883188354,1.1749837835599282,-0.20505006000561254,0.21697611416361412,0.4538437139383987,0.5274179864253392,0.4538437139383987,-0.06790852110434467,0.7990103437581161,2.309899308868767,2.268709856464706,2.309899308868767,0.04515079860246682,58.130799162715995,-0.9954,-1.0112064052110088,-0.17437001717552358,-1.0112064052110088,0.0524133587967638

many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose
good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my

his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My
father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridgemost
important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the
extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
gentlemans education. My father was not only fond of this young
mans society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also
the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his
profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it
is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very
different manner. The vicious propensitiesthe want of principle,
which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best
friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly

him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here

1074,1074,34,"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his
attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his
will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his
advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allowand if he took orders, desired that a valuable family
living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a
legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against
taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for
him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of
the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some
intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that
the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient
support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;
the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to
assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be
in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his
society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of
the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he
applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in
believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most
unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being
ordained, if I would present him to the living in questionof
which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well
assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could
not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions. You will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in
proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was
doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his

acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last
summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.",my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice,2586,465,11.550000000000002,3.6314333034842248,4.800000000000002,3.6314333034842248,0.12485391933848874,12.55,4.003557787903849,5.2444444444444445,4.003557787903849,0.12311827956989255,-14.001606869458294,-0.5389334706775318,-0.24712776726846905,-0.5389334706775318,-0.030213315184583863,4.923159523809526,3.1508711083717,3.4912320177876603,3.1508711083717,0.10905522221775787,12.224999999999996,2.587695651317444,2.9403606102635225,2.587695651317444,-0.2669581450971648,55.75504364080316,1.9363066278387,2.247101978868945,1.9363066278387,-0.12996605911977868,0.4806123073396914,-0.03193082742372118,0.13203453085571468,-0.03193082742372118,-0.14823335376617625,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': -0.1265}",-0.1265,-0.7641092365311727,-0.6183797857861412,-0.7641092365311727,-0.38509808194877976,0.07458333333333336,-0.1594204069883792,-0.058905228758169885,-0.1594204069883792,-0.15606055520123524,0.4835796344960566,1.1518225785330645,1.233206994569291,1.1518225785330645,-0.1618219557049632,74.8153158425453,-0.9999,-1.0161109477565662,-0.17667717706170372,-1.0161109477565662,0.06675859627620379
1075,1075,34,"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should
induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I
feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten
years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mothers
nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she
was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in
London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over
it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly
by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance
between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most
unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart
retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,
that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent
to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that
I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly
a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,
unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother
whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole
to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my
sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I
wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickhams chief
object was unquestionably my sisters fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge
would have been complete indeed.",i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed,1800,318,4.949999999999998,1.2912707838153208,1.8666666666666665,1.2912707838153208,-0.06528972290785665,4.949999999999998,1.2778460246250831,1.8666666666666665,1.2778460246250831,-0.10534591194968557,14.78841173177918,0.02236598953622831,0.26101483971052364,0.02236598953622831,0.0466624855107723,5.083333333333334,3.26309211923688,3.6108949416342413,3.26309211923688,0.2684105010702962,10.236999999999997,2.053508170869108,2.3889042995839103,2.053508170869108,-0.17541349803924214,82.4765741736023,3.1340924422610352,3.493125526612636,3.1340924422610352,0.18996931693472285,2.0470649635126192,1.150872276168487,1.2855177408349372,1.150872276168487,0.05088836026185341,"{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.7481}",0.7481,0.8186539509365613,0.4167110479910053,0.8186539509365613,-0.224451792495802,0.11086956521739133,-0.0031411070943373537,0.09050866723500993,-0.0031411070943373537,-0.11938958170964582,0.4417840089933092,0.998373532820954,1.0959993969829462,0.998373532820954,-0.10242351388983097,55.78252025571887,-0.9939,-1.009571557695823,-0.17360096388013024,-1.009571557695823,0.045612925488184165

1079,1079,35,"If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect
it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no
expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may
well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a
contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read
were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first
understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and
steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a
strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his
account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an
eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from
impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was
incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.
His belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved
to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to
the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him

nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the
letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she
could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related
to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the
meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the
Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the
kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known
its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each
recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the
difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was
fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side
or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that
her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the
closest attention, the particulars immediately following of
Wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living, of his
receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,
again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,
weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut
with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again
she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,

so represent as to render Mr. Darcys conduct in it less than
infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely
blameless throughout the whole.",in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole,1671,292,1.1102230246251563e-16,-0.4638511059363558,-0.3333333333333333,-0.4638511059363558,-0.3844839237907105,1.1102230246251563e-16,-0.4974530843525333,-0.3333333333333333,-0.4974530843525333,-0.4166666666666667,29.939346137558612,0.3177534785645456,0.5284281892381811,0.3177534785645456,0.10288046403467514,4.450783333333332,2.8199147943433376,3.1383284046692586,2.8199147943433376,0.2464782762802037,4.766,0.583417775731864,0.8712898751733703,0.583417775731864,-0.4215889834783483,-6.377480815644455,-0.8487679889327316,-0.6501343324444229,-0.8487679889327316,-0.4551482296224237,0.3460104282837507,-0.1335665325753068,0.032918220566448164,-0.1335665325753068,-0.142654712363423,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9797}",0.9797,1.2377803563990897,0.6908101071069295,1.2377803563990897,-0.16308247218126665,0.017887205387205406,-0.4036020351727224,-0.2923598732422262,-0.4036020351727224,-0.17537209795559405,0.10373635710846113,-0.2427393578938852,-0.013750861014174012,-0.2427393578938852,-0.2782536828343428,50.5175225294276,-0.9696,-0.9830870279498134,-0.16114230049475764,-0.9830870279498134,0.041382784655686615

lay at Mr. Wickhams charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more
so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never
heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia, in
which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on
meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight
acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in
Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,
had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of
enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him
at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect
some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity
or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what
Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years
continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could
see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general
approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social
powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a
considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!
the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received
some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she
was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel
Fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs, and
whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she
had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked
by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly
banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have
hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousins corroboration.",the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration,2112,361,8.749999999999998,2.638637083018628,3.5555555555555554,2.638637083018628,0.11254053909663428,9.0,2.7303634774249512,3.6666666666666665,2.7303634774249512,0.08194829178208685,43.548456194831545,0.5830810643136084,0.7686284044221148,0.5830810643136084,0.12104281534597135,5.576433333333334,3.6085679534080985,3.97928093385214,3.6085679534080985,0.25252360481049285,11.284,2.334843327825551,2.6793342579750346,2.334843327825551,-0.18990499258783133,113.28679122089892,4.515152590489727,4.929804309098687,4.515152590489727,0.3148939425942573,0.5009285580491455,-0.016590354605852054,0.14699473663706114,-0.016590354605852054,-0.13518741222215222,"{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9061}",0.9061,1.1045864727978716,0.6037043612048051,1.1045864727978716,-0.21481405250539345,0.013141025641025638,-0.4240431118398791,-0.31190296631473113,-0.4240431118398791,-0.18021393919653175,0.18506344331544528,0.05584604713104811,0.2532314842177291,0.05584604713104811,-0.25149141808298986,60.61235552394661,-0.9518,-0.9636868374362754,-0.15201620138942296,-0.9636868374362754,0.05621464562414488

concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence
of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of
her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but
his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself
could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been
deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his
vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had
most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour
grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.
Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned
by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;

1103,1103,36,"Lady Catherine seemed resigned. Mrs. Collins, you must send a
servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have
the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young
women should always be properly guarded and attended, according
to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two
men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,
of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to

heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its
writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the
style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when
she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,
her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed
feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited
gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not
approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own
past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and
regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of
yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,
contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to
restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her
mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely
insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;
but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence, what
chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydias guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,
would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and
vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt
with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they

1145,1145,38,"How nicely we are all crammed in, cried Lydia. I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk
and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear
what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen
any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes
that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost
three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being
married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you cant think. She says Lizzy had better have
taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any
fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of
you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear
me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel
Forsters. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the
bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked
the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was

1228,1228,40,"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to
assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that
direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,
for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have
suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which
you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his
visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands
much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when

comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had
brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the
unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the

principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise

1233,1233,41,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhams departure she found
little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home
she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the
dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their
domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her
natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were
removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil
might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly
and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,
what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she
had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking
place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It
was consequently necessary to name some other period for the
commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which
her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the
pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and
prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now
the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation

range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the
stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole
park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant
smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the
matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought
them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to
the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They
crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air
of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet
visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed
room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough
coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its
windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived
their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great
walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,
obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on
the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but
their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to
indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in
the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced
but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were
again surprised, and Elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to
what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching
them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more
prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and
to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a
few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into
some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk
concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was
immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost
none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she
began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she
had not got beyond the words delightful, and charming, when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise
of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her
colour changed, and she said no more.",they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more,2746,487,12.15,3.8441753507268506,5.066666666666666,3.8441753507268506,0.1271086483168466,11.15,3.5014529894051276,4.622222222222222,3.5014529894051276,0.04123887748117727,152.98355328120442,2.716662906472657,2.7001532255307215,2.716662906472657,0.3152021979562889,1.0541666666666665,0.4401764526752525,0.6007782101167309,0.4401764526752525,-0.1396017697519507,17.146,3.9099977596103312,4.305409153952843,3.9099977596103312,-0.12863571716829458,61.76531926230903,2.2057157049636698,2.5273608114846104,2.2057157049636698,-0.11407940386224112,5.882057991173455,4.046613578975511,4.109478012064367,4.046613578975511,0.25874695720678376,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.9918}",0.9918,1.2596777204150509,0.7051304810935558,1.2596777204150509,-0.2437916803403157,0.055939716312056735,-0.2397156392099928,-0.1356730635516619,-0.2397156392099928,-0.1649293388910486,0.9858369453640616,2.995817114505736,2.8820283285112103,2.995817114505736,0.005565826860266378,78.6923974494827,-0.9669,-0.980144302422479,-0.15975800456304953,-0.980144302422479,0.07033441421689751

guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour
which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and
the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the
circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the
preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing

other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter
than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation
of Elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing. She was

have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious

to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she
could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had
been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side
that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that
could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon
satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere
they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.

1339,1339,43,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,
as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.
They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn
his character from their own feelings and his servants report,
without any reference to any other account, the circle in
Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it
for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing
the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority
of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and
whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily
rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably
had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants

1341,1341,43,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening
more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it
seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings
towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours
endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been
ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so
called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable
qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now
heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony
so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in
so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,
above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of
goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;
gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving
her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony
of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would
avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental
meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any
indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his
sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only
astonishment but gratitudefor to love, ardent love, it must be
attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be
encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to
him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted
to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,
and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should
employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,
of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.",as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses,2137,376,6.4,1.8053973979850042,2.5111111111111106,1.8053973979850042,-0.03544887240623583,4.65,1.1702521392325,1.7333333333333332,1.1702521392325,-0.16932624113475178,144.30869988214175,2.547535175165179,2.547042431042704,2.547535175165179,0.3851040834404506,8.00589761904762,5.310699773923872,5.794289271817675,5.310699773923872,0.4250813876248839,18.697000000000006,4.326760728511422,4.735644937586686,4.326760728511422,0.09657929145070873,106.71963882417069,4.2207816534546785,4.623578342068059,4.2207816534546785,0.2461038231430708,3.9803707067355782,2.6106802213786198,2.709139262861902,2.6106802213786198,0.2037663598248877,"{'neg': 0.067, 'neu': 0.677, 'pos': 0.256, 'compound': 0.9981}",0.9981,1.2710788272993945,0.7125865435824604,1.2710788272993945,-0.20596637210609167,0.2388690476190476,0.5481332594600751,0.617565359477124,0.5481332594600751,-0.06355224579259829,1.106858665738213,3.4401379561840266,3.2793210908174504,3.4401379561840266,0.16192040895783405,63.022536189979974,0.9901,1.152786755723239,0.8436001948268348,1.152786755723239,0.1704881046067717

other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended
a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than

whole party were awakened against them, and that there was
scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first
came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so
strongly marked as in Miss Bingleys, in spite of the smiles
which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her
attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her
brothers entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and
Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to
get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt

the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a
tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance
showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking
at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to
lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then
giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained
from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she
believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which
might injure her in Darcys opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the
latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of
her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had
ever reached her of Miss Darcys meditated elopement. To no
creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except
to Elizabeth; and from all Bingleys connections her brother was
particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which
Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and

1368,1368,45,"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,
for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to
Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton
the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydias
short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were
going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing
his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia
at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking
the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did
trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering
that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the
chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this
is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not
what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side
London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and
Hatfield, but without any successno such people had been seen to
pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,
and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to
his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one
can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very
great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think
so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for
them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first
plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young
woman of Lydias connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,
that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he
shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.
was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and
keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but
this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my
life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having
concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,
one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have
been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as
the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have
just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I
cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as
possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not
afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to
ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I
am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him
to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel
Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In

1387,1387,45,"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,
Elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor
faulty. But if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is
unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often
described as arising on a first interview with its object, and
even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in
her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the
latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill
success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less
interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydias infamy
must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that
wretched business. Never, since reading Janes second letter, had
she entertained a hope of Wickhams meaning to marry her. No one
but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an
expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this
development. While the contents of the first letter remained in
her mind, she was all surpriseall astonishment that Wickham
should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an
attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though
she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an

temptation is not adequate to the risk!",i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,652,120,1.4,0.032547004296441674,0.2888888888888889,0.032547004296441674,-0.14524948232093518,1.4,0.0046517141461863845,0.2888888888888889,0.0046517141461863845,-0.18333333333333332,-34.55728472518909,-0.9396935759264292,-0.6099346094072384,-0.9396935759264292,-0.2889560685503671,0.6875,0.18328236926530134,0.3268482490272373,0.18328236926530134,-0.03436974138956723,2.263000000000001,-0.08915328239800667,0.17697642163661606,-0.08915328239800667,-0.38224386577041214,20.287416231115305,0.34647924387220597,0.5932483988569139,0.34647924387220597,-0.017189072933009517,0.6138117786961923,0.06864594232189328,0.2301181551404124,0.06864594232189328,0.0021662702593422648,"{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.4321}",0.4321,0.2467889072139408,0.042724421563406084,0.2467889072139408,-0.1480436750032233,0.09848484848484848,-0.056480204593688174,0.039512774806892366,-0.056480204593688174,-0.0274335446031596,0.4446768119075953,1.0089942100160167,1.1054959539404177,1.0089942100160167,0.2914752249966048,24.75707507407975,-0.9998,-1.0160019579222204,-0.17662590684201082,-1.0160019579222204,-0.06728107491774132

their marriage be private? Oh, no, nothis is not likely. His
most particular friend, you see by Janes account, was persuaded
of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a
woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims
has Lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good
humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of
benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the
apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I
know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But
as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.

my fathers behaviour, from his indolence and the little

other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you
yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke
of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality

libertywhich it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about
the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss
Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,

without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send
them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it
will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign
my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can
hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not
keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I
hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I
shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you
would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown
before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel

1462,1462,46,"He meant I believe, replied Jane, to go to Epsom, the place
where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if
anything could be made out from them. His principal object must
be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them
from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he
thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing
from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make
enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house
the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make

1472,1472,47,"My dear Sir,
I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are
now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a
letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your
respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of
the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time
can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can
alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you, under a
circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
parents mind. The death of your daughter would have been a
blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be
lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your
daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;
though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and
Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must
be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,
at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to
be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,
but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have
related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this
false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself
condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with
augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for
had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your
sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console
yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of
her own heinous offense.",my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a because which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense,1986,351,1.5,0.06800401217021296,0.3333333333333333,0.06800401217021296,-0.29685226024866823,1.5500000000000005,0.05844865684247792,0.3555555555555557,0.05844865684247792,-0.32834757834757833,-145.755889693766,-3.1076573348210688,-2.5725852698250518,-3.1076573348210688,-0.4166702093550575,-2.398857142857142,-1.9790818742529956,-1.9789127292940516,-1.9790818742529956,-0.4052673787810104,10.960999999999999,2.248051297551501,2.5897364771151183,2.248051297551501,-0.19036566302831187,56.743719215410614,1.9806237591825464,2.293203868336983,1.9806237591825464,-0.03416300188843803,-1.1743417290227682,-1.281559893963396,-1.086618127881711,-1.281559893963396,-0.3096049015738723,"{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': -0.6704}",-0.6704,-1.7484047975461516,-1.262086513994911,-1.7484047975461516,-0.48535384394708203,0.041558441558441565,-0.30165360943682845,-0.19489007724301846,-0.30165360943682845,-0.16424089264880107,0.20683528032959972,0.1357794749248731,0.3247045490617336,0.1357794749248731,-0.23846001286453236,57.87827093040786,-0.9470000000000001,-0.9584553253876807,-0.14955523084416414,-0.9584553253876807,0.05488233377603114

1474,1474,47,"Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer
from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant
nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single
relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was
certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances
had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did
not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any
of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as
likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his
own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in
addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations, for it
had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than
a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at
Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour

there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to
perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your
side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,
her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during
your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying
with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall
send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me
your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,
that Mr. Wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are
generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that
respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,
even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in
addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,
you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole
of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be
the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore
stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write
explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be
married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She
comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more

in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,
both on his account and my nieces. It is Mr. Wickhams intention
to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are
still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He
has the promise of an ensigncy in General s regiment, now
quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from
this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among
different people, where they may each have a character to
preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to
Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and
to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.
Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,
for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the
trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in
Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his
information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he
has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will
be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless
they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.

1613,1613,51,"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had
a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with
him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my
curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have
been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where
your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked
with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can
collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and
came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive
professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that
Wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it
impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in
him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his
private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for
itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and
endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace
him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to
discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which
was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
reason for his resolving to follow us.",on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us,1378,255,0.7500000000000001,-0.1979235468830714,4.934324553889584e-17,-0.1979235468830714,-0.32417272005883435,0.7500000000000001,-0.22846837087107635,4.934324553889584e-17,-0.22846837087107635,-0.357843137254902,-30.575132559523887,-0.8620562568251187,-0.5396497926144773,-0.8620562568251187,-0.12030997117924992,4.791016666666667,3.0582891497401907,3.392510505836575,3.0582891497401907,0.35115938624030685,10.89,2.228973173249775,2.5700416088765605,2.228973173249775,-0.012318428107741657,25.737933008967733,0.590797273102199,0.8474057063599426,0.590797273102199,-0.173486676815346,0.3545305026063684,-0.12713316204737174,0.03919211760392728,-0.12713316204737174,-0.13508784789722816,"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.923, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.8057}",0.8057,0.922892642450558,0.4848807621752766,0.922892642450558,-0.17505059121096953,0.02962962962962963,-0.3530291940596412,-0.24400871459694995,-0.3530291940596412,-0.16467051614263464,0.09607422328173984,-0.27087022349731,-0.03890428226588815,-0.27087022349731,-0.2745975992008839,44.670843328402405,-0.9299,-0.9398180637145628,-0.14078802327667972,-0.9398180637145628,0.0343110466021944
1614,1614,51,"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on
some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She
then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since
maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he
knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for
intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or
three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would
not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,
for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham
indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have
taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind
friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in  street.
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His
first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her
to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found
Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not
hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some
time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were
her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and
expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with
Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He
confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of
some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not
to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydias flight on her own
folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and
as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about
it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew
he should have nothing to live on.",there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some because of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on,2055,371,-2.65,-1.4034618145912938,-1.5111111111111108,-1.4034618145912938,-0.5309539899966954,0.3500000000000002,-0.37192688472785335,-0.1777777777777777,-0.37192688472785335,-0.3977987421383648,-72.20992618249262,-1.673781581159545,-1.2745021338247855,-1.673781581159545,-0.19529739300538426,8.945833333333333,5.96923774788489,6.496498054474706,5.96923774788489,0.508346954555851,15.217,3.3916639317507538,3.7703190013869614,3.3916639317507538,-0.03852936718015925,0.0,-0.5628990323116562,-0.35275274115335625,-0.5628990323116562,-0.4050423918464316,-0.663982429450739,-0.8961958287922481,-0.7108066529589072,-0.8961958287922481,-0.2522682831715586,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9897}",0.9897,1.255877351453603,0.7026451269305877,1.255877351453603,-0.20516247248700525,0.18760930735930734,0.327365328908925,0.4064958407605466,0.327365328908925,-0.08879883561972916,0.938867968315437,2.823374553364697,2.727837538819444,2.823374553364697,0.09166774309953894,60.92038790210529,-0.9982,-1.0142581205726888,-0.17580558332692456,-1.0142581205726888,0.05504365946871023

it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and

what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would
not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour

last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious
manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If
she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not

1628,1628,51,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of
spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure
or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled
suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might
have been doing to forward her sisters match, which she had
feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be
probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain
of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be
true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on
himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman
whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to
meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,
the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name
it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a
girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did
whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection
for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind
of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,
done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a
reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch
of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;
and though she would not place herself as his principal
inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality
for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of
mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly
painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who
could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,
her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she
grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,
every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself
she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of
himself. She read over her aunts commendation of him again and
again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding
how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that
affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.",the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brother in law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a because where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a because of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself,2715,473,8.350000000000001,2.4968090515235444,3.3777777777777787,2.4968090515235444,-0.02248919356915366,7.85,2.3179202500867166,3.1555555555555554,2.3179202500867166,-0.08474277660324174,41.88005249064707,0.5505533292138772,0.7391811498204359,0.5505533292138772,0.08884224638111045,6.704166666666668,4.398680737946779,4.821789883268481,4.398680737946779,0.214928483500944,22.229,5.275830236028282,5.715395284327323,5.275830236028282,0.05422674103743868,49.494797923524104,1.6556927047046517,1.9551870539803144,1.6556927047046517,-0.1649820427614062,3.1931973125662783,2.0162983037256463,2.129491170761246,2.0162983037256463,0.062445444558816926,"{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9884}",0.9884,1.2535247420965159,0.7011065743535121,1.2535247420965159,-0.2405420837459283,0.18217592592592596,0.3039645787516955,0.3841230936819172,0.3039645787516955,-0.11227880283853953,1.0961156010129651,3.400695717665445,3.2440535219287177,3.400695717665445,0.055400979687467614,77.11571509847563,-0.9474,-0.9588912847250638,-0.14976031172293575,-0.9588912847250638,0.06995409134194433

little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the
awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost
for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both
sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and
of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her
dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only
as Mr. Bingleys friend, without being heard by either of them.

suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew
Mrs. Gardiners letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment
towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she
had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own
more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole
family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she
regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at
least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her
astonishment at his comingat his coming to Netherfield, to
Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to

condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it
became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on
the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what
she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give
the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her
noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.
Mr. Collins moreover adds, I am truly rejoiced that my cousin
Lydias sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only
concerned that their living together before the marriage took
place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect
the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement
at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as
soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and
had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously
have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a
Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing. _That_ is his notion of
Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his
dear Charlottes situation, and his expectation of a young
olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.

1935,1935,57,"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the
contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is
much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful
recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be
repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,
though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was
_right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given
good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was
spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,
encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to
care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all
the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of
their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from
eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but
for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.

Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such

from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,

congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family
heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The
reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine
had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her
nephews letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,
was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a
moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to
Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must
sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could
even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on
carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed
