2,in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I have been turning over in my mind ever since 
3, whenever you feel like criticizing any one   he told me   just remember that all the people in this world have not had the advantages that you have had  
4,he did not say any more but we have always been unusually communicative in a reserved way  and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that 
5,in consequence i  inclined to reserve all judgments  a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores 
6,the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person  and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician  because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild  unknown men 
7,most of the confidences were unsought frequently i have feigned sleep  preoccupation  or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions 
8,reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope 
9,i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that  as my father snobbishly suggested  and i snobbishly repeat  a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth 
10,and  after boasting this way of my tolerance  i come to the admission that it has a limit 
11,conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point i do not care what it is founded on 
12,when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever  i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart 
13,only gatsby  the man who gives his name to this book  was exempt from my reaction gatsby who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn 
14,if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures  then there was something gorgeous about him  some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life  as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away 
15,this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the  creative temperament  it was an extraordinary gift for hope  a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again 
16,no gatsby turned out all right at the end  it is what preyed on gatsby  what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short winded elations of men 
17,my family have been prominent  well to do people in this middle western city for three generations 
18,the carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we are descended from the dukes of buccleuch  but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather own brother who came here in fifty one  sent a substitute to the civil war and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today 
19,i never saw this great uncle but i  supposed to look like him with special reference to the rather hard boiled painting that hangs in father own office 
20,i graduated from new haven in   just a quarter of a century after my father  and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war 
21,i enjoyed the counter raid so thoroughly that i came back restless 
22,instead of being the warm center of the world the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe so i decided to go east and learn the bond business 
23,everybody i knew was in the bond business so i supposed it could support one more single man 
24,all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said   why ye es  with very grave  hesitant faces 
25,father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays i came east  permanently  i thought  in the spring of twenty two 
26,the practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees  so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea 
27,he found the house  a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month  but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington and i went out to the country alone 
28,i had a dog  at least i had him for a few days until he ran away  and an old dodge and a finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove 
29,it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man  more recently arrived than i  stopped me on the road 
30, how do you get to west egg village   he asked helplessly 
31,i told him 
32,and as i walked on i was lonely no longer 
33,i was a guide  a pathfinder  an original settler 
34,he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood 
35,and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer 
36,there was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath giving air 
37,i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint  promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew 
38,and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides 
39,i was rather literary in college one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the  yale news  and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists  the  well rounded man  
40,this is not just an epigram life is much more successfully looked at from a single window  after all 
41,it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america 
42,it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york and where there are  among other natural curiosities  two unusual formations of land 
43,twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs  identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay  jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere  the great wet barnyard of long island sound 
44,they are not perfect ovals like the egg in the columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead 
45,to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size 
46,i lived at west egg  the well  the less fashionable of the two  though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them 
47,my house was at the very tip of the egg  only fifty yards from the sound  and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season 
48,the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard it was a factual imitation of some h tel de ville in normandy  with a tower on one side  spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy  and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden 
49,it was gatsby own mansion 
50,or rather  as i did not know mr  gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name 
51,my own house was an eye sore  but it was a small eye sore  and it had been overlooked  so i had a view of the water  a partial view of my neighbor own lawn  and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month 
52,across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water  and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans 
53,daisy was my second cousin once removed and I would known tom in college 
54,and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago 
55,her husband  among various physical accomplishments  had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven a national figure in a way  one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty one that everything afterward savors of anti climax 
56,his family were enormously wealthy even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach but now he would left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away  for instance he would brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest 
57,it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that 
58,why they came east i do not know 
59,they had spent a year in france  for no particular reason  and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together 
60,this was a permanent move  said daisy over the telephone  but i did not believe it i had no sight into daisy own heart but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game 
61,and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all 
62,their house was even more elaborate than i expected  a cheerful red and white georgian colonial mansion overlooking the bay 
63,the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile  jumping over sun dials and brick walks and burning gardens finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run 
64,the front was broken by a line of french windows  glowing now with reflected gold  and wide open to the warm windy afternoon  and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch 
65,he had changed since his new haven years 
66,now he was a sturdy  straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner 
67,two shining  arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward 
68,not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat 
69,it was a body capable of enormous leverage a cruel body 
70,his speaking voice  a gruff husky tenor  added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed 
71,there was a touch of paternal contempt in it  even toward people he liked and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts 
72, now  do not think my opinion on these matters is final   he seemed to say   just because i  stronger and more of a man than you are  
73,we were in the same senior society  and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh  defiant wistfulness of his own 
74,we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch 
75, I have got a nice place here   he said  his eyes flashing about restlessly 
76,turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista  including in its sweep a sunken italian garden  a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore 
77, it belonged to demaine the oil man  
78,he turned me around again  politely and abruptly 
79, we  go inside  
80,we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy colored space  fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end 
81,the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house 
82,a breeze blew through the room  blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags  twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling and then rippled over the wine colored rug  making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea 
83,the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon 
84,they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house 
85,i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall 
86,then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor 
87,the younger of the two was a stranger to me 
88,she was extended full length at her end of the divan  completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall 
89,if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it indeed  i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in 
90,the other girl  daisy  made an attempt to rise she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then she laughed  an absurd  charming little laugh  and i laughed too and came forward into the room 
91, i  p paralyzed with happiness  
92,she laughed again  as if she said something very witty  and held my hand for a moment  looking up into my face  promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see 
93,that was a way she had 
94,she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker 
95, I have heard it said that daisy own murmur was only to make people lean toward her  an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming  
96,at any rate miss baker own lips fluttered  she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright 
97,again a sort of apology arose to my lips 
98,almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me 
99,i looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low  thrilling voice 
100,it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again 
101,her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it  bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget  a singing compulsion  a whispered  listen   a promise that she had done gay  exciting things just a while since and that there were gay  exciting things hovering in the next hour 
102,i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me 
103, do they miss me   she cried ecstatically 
104, the whole town is desolate  all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there is a persistent wail all night along the north shore  
105, how gorgeous  let us go back  tom  tomorrow  
106,then she added irrelevantly   you ought to see the baby  
107, I would like to  
108, she is asleep  she is two years old  have not you ever seen her  
109, never  
110, well  you ought to see her  she is  
111,tom buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder 
112, what you doing  nick  
113, i  a bond man  
114, who with  
115,i told him 
116, never heard of them   he remarked decisively 
117,this annoyed me 
118, you will   i answered shortly 
119, you will if you stay in the east  
120, oh  i  stay in the east  do not you worry   he said  glancing at daisy and then back at me  as if he were alert for something more 
121, I would be a god damned fool to live anywhere else  
122,at this point miss baker said  absolutely   with such suddenness that i started it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room 
123,evidently it surprised her as much as it did me  for she yawned and with a series of rapid  deft movements stood up into the room 
124, i  stiff   she complained   I have been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember  
125, do not look at me   daisy retorted 
126, I have been trying to get you to new york all afternoon  
127, no  thanks   said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry   i  absolutely in training  
128,her host looked at her incredulously 
129, you are  
130,he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass 
131, how you ever get anything done is beyond me  
132,i looked at miss baker wondering what it was she  got done  
133,i enjoyed looking at her 
134,she was a slender  small breasted girl  with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet 
135,her grey sun strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan  charming discontented face 
136,it occurred to me now that i had seen her  or a picture of her  somewhere before 
137, you live in west egg   she remarked contemptuously 
138, i know somebody there  
139, i do not know a single  
140, you must know gatsby  
141, gatsby   demanded daisy 
142, what gatsby  
143,before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced  wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square 
144,slenderly  languidly  their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind 
145, why candles   objected daisy  frowning 
146,she snapped them out with her fingers 
147, in two weeks it  be the longest day in the year  
148,she looked at us all radiantly 
149, do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it  i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it  
150, we ought to plan something   yawned miss baker  sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed 
151, all right   said daisy 
152, what  we plan  
153,she turned to me helplessly 
154, what do people plan  
155,before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger 
156, look   she complained 
157, i hurt it  
158,we all looked the knuckle was black and blue 
159, you did it  tom   she said accusingly 
160, i know you did not mean to but you did do it  that is what i get for marrying a brute of a man  a great big hulking physical specimen of a  
161, i hate that word hulking   objected tom crossly   even in kidding  
162, hulking   insisted daisy 
163,sometimes she and miss baker talked at once  unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter  that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire 
164,they were here and they accepted tom and me  making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained 
165,they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away 
166,it was sharply different from the west where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself 
167, you make me feel uncivilized  daisy   i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret 
168, cannot you talk about crops or something  
169,i meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way 
170, civilization own going to pieces   broke out tom violently 
171, I have gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things  have you read  the rise of the coloured empires  by this man goddard  
172, why  no   i answered  rather surprised by his tone 
173, well  it is a fine book  and everybody ought to read it  the idea is if we do not look out the white race will be will be utterly submerged  it is all scientific stuff  it is been proved  
174, tom own getting very profound   said daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness 
175, he reads deep books with long words in them  what was that word we  
176, well  these books are all scientific   insisted tom  glancing at her impatiently 
177, this fellow has worked out the whole thing  it is up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things  
178, we have got to beat them down   whispered daisy  winking ferociously toward the fervent sun 
179, you ought to live in california   began miss baker but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair 
180, this idea is that we are nordics  i am  and you are and you are and  
181,after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again 
182,  and we have produced all the things that go to make civilization oh  science and art and all that  do you see  
183,there was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency  more acute than of old  was not enough to him any more 
184,when  almost immediately  the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me 
185, i  tell you a family secret   she whispered enthusiastically 
186, it is about the butler own nose  do you want to hear about the butler own nose  
187, that is why i came over tonight  
188, well  he was not always a butler  he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people  he had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose  
189, things went from bad to worse   suggested miss baker 
190, yes  things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position  
191,for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face  her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened then the glow faded  each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk 
192,the butler came back and murmured something close to tom own ear whereupon tom frowned  pushed back his chair and without a word went inside 
193,as if his absence quickened something within her daisy leaned forward again  her voice glowing and singing 
194, i love to see you at my table  nick  you remind me of a of a rose  an absolute rose  does not he  
195,she turned to miss baker for confirmation 
196, an absolute rose  
197,this was untrue 
198,i am not even faintly like a rose 
199,she was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless  thrilling words 
200,then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house 
201,miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning 
202,i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said  sh   in a warning voice 
203,a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and miss baker leaned forward  unashamed  trying to hear 
204,the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence  sank down  mounted excitedly  and then ceased altogether 
205, this mr  gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor  
206,i said 
207, do not talk  i want to hear what happens  
208, is something happening  
209,i inquired innocently 
210, you mean to say you do not know   said miss baker  honestly surprised 
211, i thought everybody knew  
212, i do not  
213, why   she said hesitantly   tom own got some woman in new york  
214, got some woman  
215,i repeated blankly 
216,miss baker nodded 
217, she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time  do not you think  
218,almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and tom and daisy were back at the table 
219, it could not be helped   cried daisy with tense gayety 
220,she sat down  glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me and continued   i looked outdoors for a minute and it is very romantic outdoors  there is a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line  he is singing away   her voice sang   it is romantic  is not it  tom  
221, very romantic   he said  and then miserably to me   if it is light enough after dinner i want to take you down to the stables  
222,the telephone rang inside  startlingly  and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables  in fact all subjects  vanished into air 
223,among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again  pointlessly  and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes 
224,i could not guess what daisy and tom were thinking but i doubt if even miss baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest own shrill metallic urgency out of mind 
225,to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police 
226,the horses  needless to say  were not mentioned again 
227,tom and miss baker  with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library  as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body  while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front 
228,in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee 
229,daisy took her face in her hands  as if feeling its lovely shape  and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk 
230,i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her  so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl 
231, we do not know each other very well  nick   she said suddenly 
232, even if we are cousins  you did not come to my wedding  
233, i was not back from the war  
234, that is true  
235,she hesitated 
236, well  I have had a very bad time  nick  and i  pretty cynical about everything  
237,evidently she had reason to be 
238,i waited but she did not say any more  and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter 
239, i suppose she talks  and eats  and everything  
240, oh  yes  
241,she looked at me absently 
242, listen  nick  let me tell you what i said when she was born  would you like to hear  
243, very much  
244, it  show you how I have gotten to feel about things  well  she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where  i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl  she told me it was a girl  and so i turned my head away and wept   right   i said   i  glad it is a girl  and i hope she  be a fool that is the best thing a girl can be in this world  a beautiful little fool  
245, you see i think everything own terrible anyhow   she went on in a convinced way 
246, everybody thinks so the most advanced people  and i know  I have been everywhere and seen everything and done everything  
247,her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way  rather like tom own  and she laughed with thrilling scorn 
248, sophisticated god  i  sophisticated  
249,the instant her voice broke off  ceasing to compel my attention  my belief  i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said 
250,it made me uneasy  as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me  i waited  and sure enough  in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged 
251,inside  the crimson room bloomed with light 
252,tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the  saturday evening post  the words  murmurous and uninflected  running together in a soothing tune 
253,the lamp light  bright on his boots and dull on the autumn leaf yellow of her hair  glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms 
254,when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand 
255, to be continued   she said  tossing the magazine on the table   in our very next issue  
256,her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee  and she stood up 
257, ten of the clock   she remarked  apparently finding the time on the ceiling 
258, time for this good girl to go to bed  
259, jordan own going to play in the tournament tomorrow   explained daisy   over at westchester  
260, oh  you are jordan baker  
261,i knew now why her face was familiar its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach 
262,i had heard some story of her too  a critical  unpleasant story  but what it was i had forgotten long ago 
263, good night   she said softly 
264, wake me at eight  will not you  
265, if you  get up  
266, i will  good night  mr  carraway  see you anon  
267, of course you will   confirmed daisy 
268, in fact i think i  arrange a marriage  come over often  nick  and i  sort of oh fling you together  you know lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat  and all that sort of thing  
269, good night   called miss baker from the stairs 
270, i have not heard a word  
271, she is a nice girl   said tom after a moment 
272, they ought not to let her run around the country this way  
273, who ought not to   inquired daisy coldly 
274, her family  
275, her family is one aunt about a thousand years old  besides  nick own going to look after her  are not you  nick  she is going to spend lots of week ends out here this summer  i think the home influence will be very good for her  
276,daisy and tom looked at each other for a moment in silence 
277, is she from new york  
278,i asked quickly 
279, from louisville  our white girlhood was passed together there  our beautiful white  
280, did you give nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda   demanded tom suddenly 
281, did i  
282,she looked at me 
283, i cannot seem to remember  but i think we talked about the nordic race  yes  i  sure we did  it sort of crept up on us and first thing you know  
284, do not believe everything you hear  nick   he advised me 
285,i said lightly that i had heard nothing at all  and a few minutes later i got up to go home 
286,they came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light 
287,as i started my motor daisy peremptorily called  wait 
288, i forgot to ask you something  and it is important  we heard you were engaged to a girl out west  
289, that is right   corroborated tom kindly 
290, we heard that you were engaged  
291, it is libel  i  too poor  
292, but we heard it   insisted daisy  surprising me by opening up again in a flower like way 
293, we heard it from three people so it must be true  
294,of course i knew what they were referring to  but i was not even vaguely engaged 
295,the fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons i had come east 
296,you cannot stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand i had no intention of being rumored into marriage 
297,their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich nevertheless  i was confused and a little disgusted as i drove away 
298,it seemed to me that the thing for daisy to do was to rush out of the house  child in arms but apparently there were no such intentions in her head 
299,as for tom  the fact that he  had some woman in new york  was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book 
300,something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart 
301,already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages  where new red gas pumps sat out in pools of light  and when i reached my estate at west egg i ran the car under its she would and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard 
302,the wind had blown off  leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life 
303,the silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it i saw that i was not alone fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor own mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars 
304,something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was mr  gatsby himself  come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens 
305,i decided to call to him 
306,miss baker had mentioned him at dinner  and that would do for an introduction 
307,but i did not call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way  and far as i was from him i could have sworn he was trembling 
308,involuntarily i glanced seaward and distinguished nothing except a single green light  minute and far away  that might have been the end of a dock 
309,when i looked once more for gatsby he had vanished  and i was alone again in the unquiet darkness 
310,about half way between west egg and new york the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile  so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land 
311,this is a valley of ashes a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally  with a transcendent effort  of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air 
312,occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track  gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest  and immediately the ash grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight 
313,but above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it  you perceive  after a moment  the eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg 
314,the eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg are blue and gigantic their retinas are one yard high 
315,they look out of no face but  instead  from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose 
316,evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of queens  and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away 
317,but his eyes  dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain  brood on over the solemn dumping ground 
318,the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river  and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through  the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour 
319,there is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that i first met tom buchanan own mistress 
320,the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known 
321,his acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and  leaving her at a table  sauntered about  chatting with whomsoever he knew 
322,though i was curious to see her i had no desire to meet her but i did 
323,i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car 
324, we are getting off   he insisted 
325, i want you to meet my girl  
326,i think he would tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence 
327,the supercilious assumption was that on sunday afternoon i had nothing better to do 
328,i followed him over a low white washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under doctor eckleburg own persistent stare 
329,the only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land  a sort of compact main street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing 
330,one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes  the third was a garage repairs 
331,george b  wilson 
332,cars bought and sold and i followed tom inside 
333,the interior was unprosperous and bare  the only car visible was the dust covered wreck of a ford which crouched in a dim corner 
334,it had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office  wiping his hands on a piece of waste 
335,he was a blonde  spiritless man  anaemic  and faintly handsome 
336,when he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes 
337, hello  wilson  old man   said tom  slapping him jovially on the shoulder 
338, how is business  
339, i cannot complain   answered wilson unconvincingly 
340, when are you going to sell me that car  
341, next week  I have got my man working on it now  
342, works pretty slow  do not he  
343, no  he does not   said tom coldly 
344, and if you feel that way about it  maybe I would better sell it somewhere else after all  
345, i do not mean that   explained wilson quickly 
346, i just meant  
347,his voice faded off and tom glanced impatiently around the garage 
348,then i heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door 
349,she was in the middle thirties  and faintly stout  but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can 
350,her face  above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe de chine  contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering 
351,she smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with tom  looking him flush in the eye 
352,then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft  coarse voice 
353, get some chairs  why do not you  so somebody can sit down  
354, oh  sure   agreed wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office  mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls 
355,a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity except his wife  who moved close to tom 
356, i want to see you   said tom intently 
357, get on the next train  
358, all right  
359, i  meet you by the news stand on the lower level  
360,she nodded and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door 
361,we waited for her down the road and out of sight 
362,it was a few days before the fourth of july  and a grey  scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track 
363, terrible place  is not it   said tom  exchanging a frown with doctor eckleburg 
364, awful  
365, it does her good to get away  
366, does not her husband object  
367, wilson  he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york  he is so dumb he does not know he is alive  
368,so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new york or not quite together  for mrs  wilson sat discreetly in another car 
369,tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might be on the train 
370,she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in new york 
371,at the news stand she bought a copy of  town tattle  and a moving picture magazine and  in the station drug store  some cold cream and a small flask of perfume 
372,upstairs  in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one  lavender colored with grey upholstery  and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine 
373,but immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass 
374, i want to get one of those dogs   she said earnestly 
375, i want to get one for the apartment  they are nice to have a dog  
376,we backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john d  rockefeller 
377,in a basket  swung from his neck  cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed 
378, what kind are they   asked mrs  wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi window 
379, all kinds  what kind do you want  lady  
380, I would like to get one of those police dogs  i do not suppose you got that kind  
381,the man peered doubtfully into the basket  plunged in his hand and drew one up  wriggling  by the back of the neck 
382, that is no police dog   said tom 
383, no  it is not exactly a police dog   said the man with disappointment in his voice 
384, it is more of an airedale  
385,he passed his hand over the brown wash rag of a back 
386, look at that coat  some coat  that is a dog that  never bother you with catching cold  
387, i think it is cute   said mrs  wilson enthusiastically 
388, how much is it  
389, that dog  
390,he looked at it admiringly 
391, that dog will cost you ten dollars  
392,the airedale undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly white changed hands and settled down into mrs  wilson own lap  where she fondled the weather proof coat with rapture 
393, is it a boy or a girl   she asked delicately 
394, that dog  that dog own a boy  
395, it is a bitch   said tom decisively 
396, here is your money  go and buy ten more dogs with it  
397,we drove over to fifth avenue  so warm and soft  almost pastoral  on the summer sunday afternoon that i would not have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner 
398, hold on   i said   i have to leave you here  
399, no  you do not   interposed tom quickly 
400, myrtle  be hurt if you do not come up to the apartment  will not you  myrtle  
401, come on   she urged 
402, i  telephone my sister catherine  she is said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know  
403, well  I would like to  but  
404,we went on  cutting back again over the park toward the west hundreds 
405,at th street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses 
406,throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood  mrs  wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in 
407, i  going to have the mckees come up   she announced as we rose in the elevator 
408, and of course i got to call up my sister  too  
409,the apartment was on the top floor a small living room  a small dining room  a small bedroom and a bath 
410,the living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of versailles 
411,the only picture was an over enlarged photograph  apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock 
412,looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room 
413,several old copies of  town tattle  lay on the table together with a copy of  simon called peter  and some of the small scandal magazines of broadway 
414,mrs  wilson was first concerned with the dog 
415,a reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon 
416,meanwhile tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door 
417,i have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight of the clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun 
418,sitting on tom own lap mrs  wilson called up several people on the telephone  then there were no cigarettes and i went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner 
419,when i came back they had disappeared so i sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of  simon called peter  either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it did not make any sense to me 
420,just as tom and myrtle after the first drink mrs  wilson and i called each other by our first names reappeared  company commenced to arrive at the apartment door 
421,the sister  catherine  was a slender  worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white 
422,her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face 
423,when she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms 
424,she came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that i wondered if she lived here 
425,but when i asked her she laughed immoderately  repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel 
426,mr  mckee was a pale feminine man from the flat below 
427,he had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room 
428,he informed me that he was in the  artistic game  and i gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of mrs  wilson own mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall 
429,his wife was shrill  languid  handsome and horrible 
430,she told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty seven times since they had been married 
431,mrs  wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon  which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room 
432,with the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change 
433,the intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur 
434,her laughter  her gestures  her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy  creaking pivot through the smoky air 
435, my dear   she told her sister in a high mincing shout   most of these fellas will cheat you every time  all they think of is money  i had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you would of thought she had my appendicitus out  
436, what was the name of the woman   asked mrs  mckee 
437, mrs  eberhardt  she goes around looking at people own feet in their own homes  
438, i like your dress   remarked mrs  mckee   i think it is adorable  
439,mrs  wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain 
440, it is just a crazy old thing   she said 
441, i just slip it on sometimes when i do not care what i look like  
442, but it looks wonderful on you  if you know what i mean   pursued mrs  mckee 
443, if chester could only get you in that pose i think he could make something of it  
444,we all looked in silence at mrs  wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile 
445,mr  mckee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face 
446, i should change the light   he said after a moment 
447, I would like to bring out the modelling of the features  and I would try to get hold of all the back hair  
448, i would not think of changing the light   cried mrs  mckee 
449, i think it is  
450,her husband said  sh    and we all looked at the subject again whereupon tom buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet 
451, you mckees have something to drink   he said 
452, get some more ice and mineral water  myrtle  before everybody goes to sleep  
453, i told that boy about the ice  
454,myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders 
455, these people  you have to keep after them all the time  
456,she looked at me and laughed pointlessly 
457,then she flounced over to the dog  kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen  implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there 
458, I have done some nice things out on long island   asserted mr  mckee 
459,tom looked at him blankly 
460, two of them we have framed downstairs  
461, two what   demanded tom 
462, two studies  one of them i call  montauk point the gulls   and the other i call  montauk point the sea    
463,the sister catherine sat down beside me on the couch 
464, do you live down on long island  too   she inquired 
465, i live at west egg  
466, really  i was down there at a party about a month ago  at a man named gatsby own  do you know him  
467, i live next door to him  
468, well  they say he is a nephew or a cousin of kaiser wilhelm own  that is where all his money comes from  
469, really  
470,she nodded 
471, i  scared of him  I would hate to have him get anything on me  
472,this absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by mrs  mckee own pointing suddenly at catherine 
473, chester  i think you could do something with her   she broke out  but mr  mckee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to tom 
474, I would like to do more work on long island if i could get the entry  all i ask is that they should give me a start  
475, ask myrtle   said tom  breaking into a short shout of laughter as mrs  wilson entered with a tray 
476, she  give you a letter of introduction  will not you  myrtle  
477, do what   she asked  startled 
478, you  give mckee a letter of introduction to your husband  so he can do some studies of him  
479,his lips moved silently for a moment as he invented 
480,   george b  wilson at the gasoline pump   or something like that  
481,catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear   neither of them can stand the person they are married to  
482, cannot they  
483, cannot stand them  
484,she looked at myrtle and then at tom 
485, what i say is  why go on living with them if they cannot stand them  if i was them I would get a divorce and get married to each other right away  
486, does not she like wilson either  
487,the answer to this was unexpected 
488,it came from myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene 
489, you see   cried catherine triumphantly 
490,she lowered her voice again 
491, it is really his wife that is keeping them apart  she is a catholic and they do not believe in divorce  
492,daisy was not a catholic and i was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie 
493, when they do get married   continued catherine   they are going west to live for a while until it blows over  
494, it would be more discreet to go to europe  
495, oh  do you like europe   she exclaimed surprisingly 
496, i just got back from monte carlo  
497, really  
498, just last year  i went over there with another girl  
499, stay long  
500, no  we just went to monte carlo and back  we went by way of marseilles  we had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms  we had an awful time getting back  i can tell you  god  how i hated that town  
501,the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the mediterranean then the shrill voice of mrs  mckee called me back into the room 
502, i almost made a mistake  too   she declared vigorously 
503, i almost married a little kyke who would been after me for years  i knew he was below me  everybody kept saying to me   lucille  that man own way below you   but if i had not met chester  he would of got me sure  
504, yes  but listen   said myrtle wilson  nodding her head up and down   at least you did not marry him  
505, i know i did not  
506, well  i married him   said myrtle  ambiguously 
507, and that is the difference between your case and mine  
508, why did you  myrtle   demanded catherine 
509, nobody forced you to  
510,myrtle considered 
511, i married him because i thought he was a gentleman   she said finally 
512, i thought he knew something about breeding  but he was not fit to lick my shoe  
513, you were crazy about him for a while   said catherine 
514, crazy about him   cried myrtle incredulously 
515, who said i was crazy about him  i never was any more crazy about him than i was about that man there  
516,she pointed suddenly at me  and every one looked at me accusingly 
517,i tried to show by my expression that i had played no part in her past 
518, the only crazy i was was when i married him  i knew right away i made a mistake  he borrowed somebody is best suit to get married in and never even told me about it  and the man came after it one day when he was out  she looked around to see who was listening     oh  is that your suit  
519,i said 
520, this is the first i ever heard about it  
521,but i gave it to him and then i lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon 
522, she really ought to get away from him   resumed catherine to me 
523, they have been living over that garage for eleven years  and tom own the first sweetie she ever had  
524,the bottle of whiskey a second one was now in constant demand by all present  excepting catherine who  felt just as good on nothing at all  
525,tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches  which were a complete supper in themselves 
526,i wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time i tried to go i became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back  as if with ropes  into my chair 
527,yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets  and i was him too  looking up and wondering 
528,i was within and without  simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life 
529,myrtle pulled her chair close to mine  and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with tom 
530, it was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train  i was going up to new york to see my sister and spend the night  he had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and i could not keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me i had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head  when we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirt front pressed against my arm and so i told him I would have to call a policeman  but he knew i lied  i was so excited that when i got into a taxi with him i did not hardly know i was not getting into a subway train  all i kept thinking about  over and over  was  you cannot live forever  you cannot live forever    
531,she turned to mrs  mckee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter 
532, my dear   she cried   i  going to give you this dress as soon as i  through with it  I have got to get another one tomorrow  i  going to make a list of all the things I have got to get  a massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash trays where you touch a spring  and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother own grave that  last all summer  i got to write down a list so i will not forget all the things i got to do  
533,it was nine of the clock almost immediately afterward i looked at my watch and found it was ten 
534,mr  mckee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap  like a photograph of a man of action 
535,taking out my handkerchief i wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon 
536,the little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly 
537,people disappeared  reappeared  made plans to go somewhere  and then lost each other  searched for each other  found each other a few feet away 
538,some time toward midnight tom buchanan and mrs  wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether mrs  wilson had any right to mention daisy own name 
539, daisy  daisy  daisy   shouted mrs  wilson 
540, i  say it whenever i want to  daisy  dai  
541,making a short deft movement tom buchanan broke her nose with his open hand 
542,then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor  and women own voices scolding  and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain 
543,mr  mckee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door 
544,when he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene his wife and catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid  and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of  town tattle  over the tapestry scenes of versailles 
545,then mr  mckee turned and continued on out the door 
546,taking my hat from the chandelier i followed 
547, come to lunch some day   he suggested  as we groaned down in the elevator 
548, where  
549, anywhere  
550, keep your hands off the lever   snapped the elevator boy 
551, i beg your pardon   said mr  mckee with dignity   i did not know i was touching it  
552, all right   i agreed   i  be glad to  
553,i was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets  clad in his underwear  with a great portfolio in his hands 
554, beauty and the beast       loneliness       old grocery horse       brook n bridge         
555,then i was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the pennsylvania station  staring at the morning  tribune  and waiting for the four of the clock train 
556,there was music from my neighbor own house through the summer nights 
557,in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars 
558,at high tide in the afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor boats slit the waters of the sound  drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam 
559,on week ends his rolls royce became an omnibus  bearing parties to and from the city  between nine in the morning and long past midnight  while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains 
560,and on mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing brushes and hammers and garden shears  repairing the ravages of the night before 
561,every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in new york every monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves 
562,there was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour  if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler own thumb 
563,at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a christmas tree of gatsby own enormous garden 
564,on buffet tables  garnished with glistening hors d oeuvre  spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold 
565,in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up  and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another 
566,by seven of the clock the orchestra has arrived no thin five piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums 
567,the last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs  the cars from new york are parked five deep in the drive  and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of castile 
568,the bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other own names 
569,the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher 
570,laughter is easier  minute by minute  spilled with prodigality  tipped out at a cheerful word 
571,the groups change more swiftly  swell with new arrivals  dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers  confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable  become for a sharp  joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light 
572,suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal  seizes a cocktail out of the air  dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform 
573,a momentary hush  the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is gilda gray own understudy from the  follies  
574,the party has begun 
575,i believe that on the first night i went to gatsby own house i was one of the few guests who had actually been invited 
576,people were not invited they went there 
577,they got into automobiles which bore them out to long island and somehow they ended up at gatsby own door 
578,once there they were introduced by somebody who knew gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks 
579,sometimes they came and went without having met gatsby at all  came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission 
580,i had been actually invited 
581,a chauffeur in a uniform of robin own egg blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honor would be entirely gatsby own  it said  if i would attend his  little party  that night 
582,he had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it signed jay gatsby in a majestic hand 
583,dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people i did not know though here and there was a face i had noticed on the commuting train 
584,i was immediately struck by the number of young englishmen dotted about  all well dressed  all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous americans 
585,i was sure that they were selling something  bonds or insurance or automobiles 
586,they were  at least  agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key 
587,as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone 
588,i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps  leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden 
589,welcome or not  i found it necessary to attach myself to someone before i should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers by 
590, hello  
591,i roared  advancing toward her 
592,my voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden 
593, i thought you might be here   she responded absently as i came up 
594, i remembered you lived next door to  
595,she held my hand impersonally  as a promise that she would take care of me in a minute  and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps 
596, hello   they cried together 
597, sorry you did not win  
598,that was for the golf tournament 
599,she had lost in the finals the week before 
600, you do not know who we are   said one of the girls in yellow   but we met you here about a month ago  
601, you have dyed your hair since then   remarked jordan  and i started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon  produced like the supper  no doubt  out of a caterer own basket 
602,with jordan own slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden 
603,a tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men  each one introduced to us as mr  mumble 
604, do you come to these parties often   inquired jordan of the girl beside her 
605, the last one was the one i met you at   answered the girl  in an alert  confident voice 
606,she turned to her companion   was not it for you  lucille  
607,it was for lucille  too 
608, i like to come   lucille said 
609, i never care what i do  so i always have a good time  when i was here last i tore my gown on a chair  and he asked me my name and address inside of a week i got a package from croirier own with a new evening gown in it  
610, did you keep it   asked jordan 
611, sure i did  i was going to wear it tonight  but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered  it was gas blue with lavender beads  two hundred and sixty five dollars  
612, there is something funny about a fellow that  do a thing like that   said the other girl eagerly 
613, he does not want any trouble with anybody  
614, who does not  
615,i inquired 
616, gatsby  somebody told me  
617,the two girls and jordan leaned together confidentially 
618, somebody told me they thought he killed a man once  
619,a thrill passed over all of us 
620,the three mr  mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly 
621, i do not think it is so much that   argued lucille skeptically   it is more that he was a german spy during the war  
622,one of the men nodded in confirmation 
623, i heard that from a man who knew all about him  grew up with him in germany   he assured us positively 
624, oh  no   said the first girl   it could not be that  because he was in the american army during the war  
625,as our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm 
626, you look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody own looking at him  i  bet he killed a man  
627,she narrowed her eyes and shivered 
628,lucille shivered 
629,we all turned and looked around for gatsby 
630,it was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world 
631,the first supper there would be another one after midnight was now being served  and jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden 
632,there were three married couples and jordan own escort  a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree 
633,instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity  and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside east egg condescending to west egg  and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety 
634, let us get out   whispered jordan  after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour 
635, this is much too polite for me  
636,we got up  and she explained that we were going to find the host i had never met him  she said  and it was making me uneasy 
637,the undergraduate nodded in a cynical  melancholy way 
638,the bar  where we glanced first  was crowded but gatsby was not there 
639,she could not find him from the top of the steps  and he was not on the veranda 
640,on a chance we tried an important looking door  and walked into a high gothic library  panelled with carved english oak  and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas 
641,a stout  middle aged man with enormous owl eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table  staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books 
642,as we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined jordan from head to foot 
643, what do you think   he demanded impetuously 
644, about what  
645,he waved his hand toward the book shelves 
646, about that  as a matter of fact you need not bother to ascertain  i ascertained  they are real  
647, the books  
648,he nodded 
649, absolutely real have pages and everything  i thought they would be a nice durable cardboard  matter of fact  they are absolutely real  pages and here  lemme show you  
650,taking our skepticism for granted  he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the  stoddard lectures  
651, see   he cried triumphantly 
652, it is a bona fide piece of printed matter  it fooled me  this fella own a regular belasco  it is a triumph  what thoroughness  what realism  knew when to stop too did not cut the pages  but what do you want  what do you expect  
653,he snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse 
654, who brought you   he demanded 
655, or did you just come  i was brought  most people were brought  
656,jordan looked at him alertly  cheerfully without answering 
657, i was brought by a woman named roosevelt   he continued 
658, mrs  claud roosevelt  do you know her  i met her somewhere last night  I have been drunk for about a week now  and i thought it might sober me up to sit in a library  
659, has it  
660, a little bit  i think  i cannot tell yet  I have only been here an hour  did i tell you about the books  they are real  they are  
661, you told us  
662,we shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors 
663,there was dancing now on the canvas in the garden  old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles  superior couples holding each other tortuously  fashionably and keeping in the corners and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps 
664,by midnight the hilarity had increased 
665,a celebrated tenor had sung in italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing  stunts  all over the garden  while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky 
666,a pair of stage  twins  who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls 
667,the moon had risen higher  and floating in the sound was a triangle of silver scales  trembling a little to the stiff  tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn 
668,i was still with jordan baker 
669,we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter 
670,i was enjoying myself now 
671,i had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant  elemental and profound 
672,at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled 
673, your face is familiar   he said  politely 
674, were not you in the third division during the war  
675, why  yes  i was in the ninth machine gun battalion  
676, i was in the seventh infantry until june nineteen eighteen  i knew I would seen you somewhere before  
677,we talked for a moment about some wet  grey little villages in france 
678,evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning 
679, want to go with me  old sport  just near the shore along the sound  
680, what time  
681, any time that suits you best  
682,it was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when jordan looked around and smiled 
683, having a gay time now   she inquired 
684, much better  
685,i turned again to my new acquaintance 
686, this is an unusual party for me  i have not even seen the host  i live over there  
687,i waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance   and this man gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation  
688,for a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand 
689, i  gatsby   he said suddenly 
690, what  
691,i exclaimed 
692, oh  i beg your pardon  
693, i thought you knew  old sport  i  afraid i  not a very good host  
694,he smiled understandingly much more than understandingly 
695,it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it  that you may come across four or five times in life 
696,it faced or seemed to face the whole external world for an instant  and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor 
697,it understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood  believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that  at your best  you hoped to convey 
698,precisely at that point it vanished and i was looking at an elegant young rough neck  a year or two over thirty  whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd 
699,some time before he introduced himself I would got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care 
700,almost at the moment when mr  gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that chicago was calling him on the wire 
701,he excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn 
702, if you want anything just ask for it  old sport   he urged me 
703, excuse me  i will rejoin you later  
704,when he was gone i turned immediately to jordan constrained to assure her of my surprise 
705,i had expected that mr  gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years 
706, who is he  
707,i demanded 
708, do you know  
709, he is just a man named gatsby  
710, where is he from  i mean  and what does he do  
711, now you are started on the subject   she answered with a wan smile 
712, well  he told me once he was an oxford man  
713,a dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away 
714, however  i do not believe it  
715, why not  
716, i do not know   she insisted   i just do not think he went there  
717,something in her tone reminded me of the other girl own  i think he killed a man   and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity 
718,i would have accepted without question the information that gatsby sprang from the swamps of louisiana or from the lower east side of new york 
719,that was comprehensible 
720,but young men did not at least in my provincial inexperience i believed they did not drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on long island sound 
721, anyhow he gives large parties   said jordan  changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete 
722, and i like large parties  they are so intimate  at small parties there is not any privacy  
723,there was the boom of a bass drum  and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden 
724, ladies and gentlemen   he cried 
725, at the request of mr  gatsby we are going to play for you mr  vladimir tostoff own latest work which attracted so much attention at carnegie hall last may  if you read the papers you know there was a big sensation  
726,he smiled with jovial condescension and added  some sensation   whereupon everybody laughed 
727, the piece is known   he concluded lustily   as  vladimir tostoff own jazz history of the world    
728,the nature of mr  tostoff own composition eluded me  because just as it began my eyes fell on gatsby  standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes 
729,his tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day 
730,i could see nothing sinister about him 
731,i wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests  for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased 
732,when the  jazz history of the world  was over girls were putting their heads on men own shoulders in a puppyish  convivial way  girls were swooning backward playfully into men own arms  even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls but no one swooned backward on gatsby and no french bob touched gatsby own shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with gatsby own head for one link 
733, i beg your pardon  
734,gatsby own butler was suddenly standing beside us 
735, miss baker   he inquired 
736, i beg your pardon but mr  gatsby would like to speak to you alone  
737, with me   she exclaimed in surprise 
738, yes  madame  
739,she got up slowly  raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment  and followed the butler toward the house 
740,i noticed that she wore her evening dress  all her dresses  like sports clothes there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean  crisp mornings 
741,i was alone and it was almost two 
742,for some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many windowed room which overhung the terrace 
743,eluding jordan own undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls  and who implored me to join him  i went inside 
744,the large room was full of people 
745,one of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall  red haired young lady from a famous chorus  engaged in song 
746,she had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad she was not only singing  she was weeping too 
747,whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano 
748,the tears coursed down her cheeks not freely  however  for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color  and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets 
749,a humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands  sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep 
750, she had a fight with a man who says he is her husband   explained a girl at my elbow 
751,i looked around 
752,most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands 
753,even jordan own party  the quartet from east egg  were rent asunder by dissension 
754,one of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress  and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond  and hissed  you promised   into his ear 
755,the reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men 
756,the hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives 
757,the wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices 
758, whenever he sees i  having a good time he wants to go home  
759, never heard anything so selfish in my life  
760, we are always the first ones to leave  
761, so are we  
762, well  we are almost the last tonight   said one of the men sheepishly 
763, the orchestra left half an hour ago  
764,in spite of the wives  agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility  the dispute ended in a short struggle  and both wives were lifted kicking into the night 
765,as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and jordan baker and gatsby came out together 
766,he was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye 
767,jordan own party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands 
768, I have just heard the most amazing thing   she whispered 
769, how long were we in there  
770, why  about an hour  
771, it was simply amazing   she repeated abstractedly 
772, but i swore i would not tell it and here i am tantalizing you  
773,she yawned gracefully in my face 
774, please come and see me        phone book        under the name of mrs  sigourney howard        my aunt        
775,she was hurrying off as she talked her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door 
776,rather ashamed that on my first appearance i had stayed so late  i joined the last of gatsby own guests who were clustered around him 
777,i wanted to explain that I would hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden 
778, do not mention it   he enjoined me eagerly 
779, do not give it another thought  old sport  
780,the familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder 
781, and do not forget we are going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine of the clock  
782,then the butler  behind his shoulder 
783, philadelphia wants you on the phone  sir  
784, all right  in a minute  tell them i  be right there        good night  
785, good night  
786, good night  
787,he smiled and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go  as if he had desired it all the time 
788, good night  old sport        good night  
789,but as i walked down the steps i saw that the evening was not quite over 
790,fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene 
791,in the ditch beside the road  right side up but violently shorn of one wheel  rested a new coup which had left gatsby own drive not two minutes before 
792,the sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs 
793,however  as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene 
794,a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road  looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant  puzzled way 
795, see   he explained 
796, it went in the ditch  
797,the fact was infinitely astonishing to him and i recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man it was the late patron of gatsby own library 
798, how did it happen  
799,he shrugged his shoulders 
800, i know nothing whatever about mechanics   he said decisively 
801, but how did it happen  did you run into the wall  
802, do not ask me   said owl eyes  washing his hands of the whole matter 
803, i know very little about driving next to nothing  it happened  and that is all i know  
804, well  if you are a poor driver you ought not to try driving at night  
805, but i was not even trying   he explained indignantly   i was not even trying  
806,an awed hush fell upon the bystanders 
807, do you want to commit suicide  
808, you are lucky it was just a wheel  a bad driver and not even trying  
809, you do not understand   explained the criminal 
810, i was not driving  there is another man in the car  
811,the shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained  ah h h   as the door of the coup swung slowly open 
812,the crowd it was now a crowd stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause 
813,then  very gradually  part by part  a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck  pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe 
814,blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster 
815, wha own matter   he inquired calmly 
816, did we run outa gas  
817, look  
818,half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky 
819, it came off   some one explained 
820,he nodded 
821, at first i din  notice we would stopped  
822,a pause 
823,then  taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice 
824, wonder ff tell me where there is a gas line station  
825,at least a dozen men  some of them little better off than he was  explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond 
826, back out   he suggested after a moment 
827, put her in reverse  
828, but the wheel own off  
829,he hesitated 
830, no harm in trying   he said 
831,the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and i turned away and cut across the lawn toward home 
832,i glanced back once 
833,a wafer of a moon was shining over gatsby own house  making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden 
834,a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors  endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch  his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell 
835,reading over what i have written so far i see i have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me 
836,on the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and  until much later  they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs 
837,most of the time i worked 
838,in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust 
839,i knew the other clerks and young bond salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee 
840,i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department  but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away 
841,i took dinner usually at the yale club for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day and then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour 
842,there were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work 
843,after that  if the night was mellow i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel and over thirty third street to the pennsylvania station 
844,i began to like new york  the racy  adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye 
845,i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives  and no one would ever know or disapprove 
846,sometimes  in my mind  i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets  and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness 
847,at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes  and felt it in others poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner young clerks in the dusk  wasting the most poignant moments of night and life 
848,again at eight of the clock  when the dark lanes of the forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs  bound for the theatre district  i felt a sinking in my heart 
849,forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited  and voices sang  and there was laughter from unheard jokes  and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside 
850,imagining that i  too  was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement  i wished them well 
851,for a while i lost sight of jordan baker  and then in midsummer i found her again 
852,at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name 
853,then it was something more 
854,i was not actually in love  but i felt a sort of tender curiosity 
855,the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something most affectations conceal something eventually  even though they do not in the beginning and one day i found what it was 
856,when we were on a house party together up in warwick  she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down  and then lied about it and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisy own 
857,at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi final round 
858,the thing approached the proportions of a scandal then died away 
859,a caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken 
860,the incident and the name had remained together in my mind 
861,jordan baker instinctively avoided clever  shrewd men  and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible 
862,she was incurably dishonest 
863,she was not able to endure being at a disadvantage  and given this unwillingness  i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool  insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body 
864,it made no difference to me 
865,dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply i was casually sorry  and then i forgot 
866,it was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car 
867,it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man own coat 
868, you are a rotten driver   i protested 
869, either you ought to be more careful or you ought not to drive at all  
870, i am careful  
871, no  you are not  
872, well  other people are   she said lightly 
873, what is that got to do with it  
874, they  keep out of my way   she insisted 
875, it takes two to make an accident  
876, suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself  
877, i hope i never will   she answered 
878, i hate careless people  that is why i like you  
879,her grey  sun strained eyes stared straight ahead  but she had deliberately shifted our relations  and for a moment i thought i loved her 
880,but i am slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires  and i knew that first i had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home 
881,I would been writing letters once a week and signing them   love  nick   and all i could think of was how  when that certain girl played tennis  a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip 
882,nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before i was free 
883,every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues  and this is mine  i am one of the few honest people that i have ever known 
884,on sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to gatsby own house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn 
885, he is a bootlegger   said the young ladies  moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers 
886, one time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von hindenburg and second cousin to the devil  reach me a rose  honey  and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass  
887,once i wrote down on the empty spaces of a time table the names of those who came to gatsby own house that summer 
888,it is an old time table now  disintegrating at its folds and headed  this schedule in effect july th    
889,but i can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted gatsby own hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him 
890,from east egg  then  came the chester beckers and the leeches and a man named bunsen whom i knew at yale and doctor webster civet who was drowned last summer up in maine 
891,and the hornbeams and the willie voltaires and a whole clan named blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near 
892,and the ismays and the chrysties  or rather hubert auerbach and mr  chrystie own wife  and edgar beaver  whose hair they say turned cotton white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all 
893,clarence endive was from east egg  as i remember 
894,he came only once  in white knickerbockers  and had a fight with a bum named etty in the garden 
895,from farther out on the island came the cheadles and the o  r  p  schraeders and the stonewall jackson abrams of georgia and the fishguards and the ripley snells 
896,snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary  so drunk out on the gravel drive that mrs  ulysses swett own automobile ran over his right hand 
897,the dancies came too and s  b  whitebait  who was well over sixty  and maurice a  flink and the hammerheads and beluga the tobacco importer and beluga own girls 
898,from west egg came the poles and the mulreadys and cecil roebuck and cecil schoen and gulick the state senator and newton orchid who controlled films par excellence and eckhaust and clyde cohen and don s  schwartze  the son  and arthur mccarty  all connected with the movies in one way or another 
899,and the catlips and the bembergs and g  earl muldoon  brother to that muldoon who afterward strangled his wife 
900,da fontano the promoter came there  and ed legros and james b    rot gut   ferret and the de jongs and ernest lilly they came to gamble and when ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and associated traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day 
901,a man named klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as  the boarder  i doubt if he had any other home 
902,of theatrical people there were gus waize and horace o donavan and lester meyer and george duckweed and francis bull 
903,also from new york were the chromes and the backhyssons and the dennickers and russel betty and the corrigans and the kellehers and the dewars and the scullys and s  w  belcher and the smirkes and the young quinns  divorced now  and henry l  palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in times square 
904,benny mcclenahan arrived always with four girls 
905,they were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before 
906,i have forgotten their names jaqueline  i think  or else consuela or gloria or judy or june  and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great american capitalists whose cousins  if pressed  they would confess themselves to be 
907,in addition to all these i can remember that faustina o brien came there at least once and the baedeker girls and young brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and mr  albrucksburger and miss haag  his fianc e  and ardita fitz peters  and mr  p  jewett  once head of the american legion  and miss claudia hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur  and a prince of something whom we called duke and whose name  if i ever knew it  i have forgotten 
908,all these people came to gatsby own house in the summer 
909,at nine of the clock  one morning late in july gatsby own gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn 
910,it was the first time he had called on me though i had gone to two of his parties  mounted in his hydroplane  and  at his urgent invitation  made frequent use of his beach 
911, good morning  old sport  you are having lunch with me today and i thought we would ride up together  
912,he was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly american that comes  i suppose  with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and  even more  with the formless grace of our nervous  sporadic games 
913,this quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness 
914,he was never quite still  there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand 
915,he saw me looking with admiration at his car 
916, it is pretty  is not it  old sport  
917,he jumped off to give me a better view 
918, have not you ever seen it before  
919,I would seen it 
920,everybody had seen it 
921,it was a rich cream color  bright with nickel  swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper boxes and tool boxes  and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns 
922,sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town 
923,i had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found  to my disappointment  that he had little to say 
924,so my first impression  that he was a person of some undefined consequence  had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door 
925,and then came that disconcerting ride 
926,we had not reached west egg village before gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel colored suit 
927, look here  old sport   he broke out surprisingly 
928, what is your opinion of me  anyhow  
929,a little overwhelmed  i began the generalized evasions which that question deserves 
930, well  i  going to tell you something about my life   he interrupted 
931, i do not want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear  
932,so he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls 
933, i  tell you god own truth  
934,his right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by 
935, i am the son of some wealthy people in the middle west all dead now  i was brought up in america but educated at oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years  it is a family tradition  
936,he looked at me sideways and i knew why jordan baker had believed he was lying 
937,he hurried the phrase  educated at oxford   or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before 
938,and with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and i wondered if there was not something a little sinister about him after all 
939, what part of the middle west  
940,i inquired casually 
941, san francisco  
942, i see  
943, my family all died and i came into a good deal of money  
944,his voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him 
945,for a moment i suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise 
946, after that i lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of europe paris  venice  rome collecting jewels  chiefly rubies  hunting big game  painting a little  things for myself only  and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago  
947,with an effort i managed to restrain my incredulous laughter 
948,the very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned  character  leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the bois de boulogne 
949, then came the war  old sport  it was a great relief and i tried very hard to die but i seemed to bear an enchanted life  i accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began  in the argonne forest i took two machine gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry could not advance  we stayed there two days and two nights  a hundred and thirty men with sixteen lewis guns  and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three german divisions among the piles of dead  i was promoted to be a major and every allied government gave me a decoration even montenegro  little montenegro down on the adriatic sea  
950,little montenegro 
951,he lifted up the words and nodded at them with his smile 
952,the smile comprehended montenegro own troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the montenegrin people 
953,it appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from montenegro own warm little heart 
954,my incredulity was submerged in fascination now  it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines 
955,he reached in his pocket and a piece of metal  slung on a ribbon  fell into my palm 
956, that is the one from montenegro  
957,to my astonishment  the thing had an authentic look 
958,orderi di danilo  ran the circular legend  montenegro  nicolas rex 
959, turn it  
960,major jay gatsby  i read  for valour extraordinary 
961, here is another thing i always carry  a souvenir of oxford days  it was taken in trinity quad the man on my left is now the earl of dorcaster  
962,it was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires 
963,there was gatsby  looking a little  not much  younger with a cricket bat in his hand 
964,then it was all true 
965,i saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the grand canal  i saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease  with their crimson lighted depths  the gnawings of his broken heart 
966, i  going to make a big request of you today   he said  pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction   so i thought you ought to know something about me  i did not want you to think i was just some nobody  you see  i usually find myself among strangers because i drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me  
967,he hesitated 
968, you  hear about it this afternoon  
969, at lunch  
970, no  this afternoon  i happened to find out that you are taking miss baker to tea  
971, do you mean you are in love with miss baker  
972, no  old sport  i  not  but miss baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter  
973,i had not the faintest idea what  this matter  was  but i was more annoyed than interested 
974,i had not asked jordan to tea in order to discuss mr  jay gatsby 
975,i was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment i was sorry I would ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn 
976,he would not say another word 
977,his correctness grew on him as we neared the city 
978,we passed port roosevelt  where there was a glimpse of red belted ocean going ships  and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark  undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen hundreds 
979,then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us  and i had a glimpse of mrs  wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by 
980,with fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half astoria only half  for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated i heard the familiar  jug jug spat   of a motor cycle  and a frantic policeman rode alongside 
981, all right  old sport   called gatsby 
982,we slowed down 
983,taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the man own eyes 
984, right you are   agreed the policeman  tipping his cap 
985, know you next time  mr  gatsby  excuse me  
986, what was that  
987,i inquired 
988, the picture of oxford  
989, i was able to do the commissioner a favor once  and he sends me a christmas card every year  
990,over the great bridge  with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars  with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non olfactory money 
991,the city seen from the queensboro bridge is always the city seen for the first time  in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world 
992,a dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms  followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends 
993,the friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south eastern europe  and i was glad that the sight of gatsby own splendid car was included in their somber holiday 
994,as we crossed blackwell own island a limousine passed us  driven by a white chauffeur  in which sat three modish negroes  two bucks and a girl 
995,i laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry 
996, anything can happen now that we have slid over this bridge   i thought   anything at all        
997,even gatsby could happen  without any particular wonder 
998,roaring noon 
999,in a well fanned forty second street cellar i met gatsby for lunch 
1000,blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom  talking to another man 
1001, mr  carraway this is my friend mr  wolfshiem  
1002,a small  flat nosed jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril 
1003,after a moment i discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness 
1004,  so i took one look at him   said mr  wolfshiem  shaking my hand earnestly    and what do you think i did  
1005, what  
1006,i inquired politely 
1007,but evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered gatsby with his expressive nose 
1008, i handed the money to katspaugh and i sid   right  katspaugh  do not pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth   he shut it then and there  
1009,gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon mr  wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction 
1010, highballs   asked the head waiter 
1011, this is a nice restaurant here   said mr  wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling 
1012, but i like across the street better  
1013, yes  highballs   agreed gatsby  and then to mr  wolfshiem   it is too hot over there  
1014, hot and small yes   said mr  wolfshiem   but full of memories  
1015, what place is that  
1016,i asked 
1017, the old metropole 
1018, the old metropole   brooded mr  wolfshiem gloomily 
1019, filled with faces dead and gone 
1020,filled with friends gone now forever 
1021,i cannot forget so long as i live the night they shot rosy rosenthal there 
1022,it was six of us at the table and rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening 
1023,when it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside 
1024, right   says rosy and begins to get up and i pulled him down in his chair 
1025,   let the bastards come in here if they want you  rosy  but do not you  so help me  move outside this room 
1026, it was four of the clock in the morning then  and if we would of raised the blinds we would of seen daylight  
1027, did he go  
1028,i asked innocently 
1029, sure he went   mr  wolfshiem own nose flashed at me indignantly  he turned around in the door and says   do not let that waiter take away my coffee   then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away  
1030, four of them were electrocuted   i said  remembering 
1031, five with becker  
1032,his nostrils turned to me in an interested way 
1033, i understand you are looking for a business gonnegtion  
1034,the juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling 
1035,gatsby answered for me 
1036, oh  no   he exclaimed   this is not the man  
1037,mr  wolfshiem seemed disappointed 
1038, this is just a friend  i told you we would talk about that some other time  
1039, i beg your pardon   said mr  wolfshiem   i had a wrong man  
1040,a succulent hash arrived  and mr  wolfshiem  forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old metropole  began to eat with ferocious delicacy 
1041,his eyes  meanwhile  roved very slowly all around the room he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind 
1042,i think that  except for my presence  he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table 
1043, look here  old sport   said gatsby  leaning toward me   i  afraid i made you a little angry this morning in the car  
1044,there was the smile again  but this time i held out against it 
1045, i do not like mysteries   i answered 
1046, and i do not understand why you will not come out frankly and tell me what you want  why has it all got to come through miss baker  
1047, oh  it is nothing underhand   he assured me 
1048, miss baker own a great sportswoman  you know  and she would never do anything that was not all right  
1049,suddenly he looked at his watch  jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with mr  wolfshiem at the table 
1050, he has to telephone   said mr  wolfshiem  following him with his eyes 
1051, fine fellow  is not he  handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman  
1052, yes  
1053, he is an oggsford man  
1054, he went to oggsford college in england  you know oggsford college  
1055, I have heard of it  
1056, it is one of the most famous colleges in the world  
1057, have you known gatsby for a long time  
1058,i inquired 
1059, several years   he answered in a gratified way 
1060, i made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war  but i knew i had discovered a man of fine breeding after i talked with him an hour  i said to myself   there is the kind of man you would like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister    
1061,he paused 
1062, i see you are looking at my cuff buttons  
1063,i had not been looking at them  but i did now 
1064,they were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory 
1065, finest specimens of human molars   he informed me 
1066, well  
1067,i inspected them 
1068, that is a very interesting idea  
1069, yeah  
1070,he flipped his sleeves up under his coat 
1071, yeah  gatsby own very careful about women  he would never so much as look at a friend own wife  
1072,when the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down mr  wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet 
1073, i have enjoyed my lunch   he said   and i  going to run off from you two young men before i outstay my welcome  
1074, do not hurry  meyer   said gatsby  without enthusiasm 
1075,mr  wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction 
1076, you are very polite but i belong to another generation   he announced solemnly 
1077, you sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your  
1078,he supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand  as for me  i am fifty years old  and i will not impose myself on you any longer  
1079,as he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling 
1080,i wondered if i had said anything to offend him 
1081, he becomes very sentimental sometimes   explained gatsby 
1082, this is one of his sentimental days  he is quite a character around new york a denizen of broadway  
1083, who is he anyhow an actor  
1084, a dentist  
1085, meyer wolfshiem  no  he is a gambler  
1086,gatsby hesitated  then added coolly   he is the man who fixed the world own series back in   
1087, fixed the world own series  
1088,i repeated 
1089,the idea staggered me  i remembered of course that the world own series had been fixed in but if i had thought of it at all i would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened  the end of some inevitable chain 
1090,it never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people with the single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe 
1091, how did he happen to do that  
1092,i asked after a minute 
1093, he just saw the opportunity  
1094, why is not he in jail  
1095, they cannot get him  old sport  he is a smart man  
1096,i insisted on paying the check 
1097,as the waiter brought my change i caught sight of tom buchanan across the crowded room 
1098, come along with me for a minute   i said 
1099, I have got to say hello to someone  
1100,when he saw us tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction 
1101, where have you been   he demanded eagerly 
1102, daisy own furious because you have not called up  
1103, this is mr  gatsby  mr  buchanan  
1104,they shook hands briefly and a strained  unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over gatsby own face 
1105, how ve you been  anyhow   demanded tom of me 
1106, how did you happen to come up this far to eat  
1107, I have been having lunch with mr  gatsby  
1108,i turned toward mr  gatsby  but he was no longer there 
1109,one october day in nineteen seventeen  said jordan baker that afternoon  sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea garden at the plaza hotel  i was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns 
1110,i was happier on the lawns because i had on shoes from england with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground 
1111,i had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red  white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut tut tut tut in a disapproving way 
1112,the largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to daisy fay own house 
1113,she was just eighteen  two years older than me  and by far the most popular of all the young girls in louisville 
1114,she dressed in white  and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from camp taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night   anyways  for an hour  
1115,when i came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb  and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant i had never seen before 
1116,they were so engrossed in each other that she did not see me until i was five feet away 
1117, hello jordan   she called unexpectedly 
1118, please come here  
1119,i was flattered that she wanted to speak to me  because of all the older girls i admired her most 
1120,she asked me if i was going to the red cross and make bandages 
1121,i was 
1122,well  then  would i tell them that she could not come that day 
1123,the officer looked at daisy while she was speaking  in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime  and because it seemed romantic to me i have remembered the incident ever since 
1124,his name was jay gatsby and i did not lay eyes on him again for over four years even after I would met him on long island i did not realize it was the same man 
1125,that was nineteen seventeen 
1126,by the next year i had a few beaux myself  and i began to play in tournaments  so i did not see daisy very often 
1127,she went with a slightly older crowd when she went with anyone at all 
1128,wild rumors were circulating about her how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to new york and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas 
1129,she was effectually prevented  but she was not on speaking terms with her family for several weeks 
1130,after that she did not play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat footed  short sighted young men in town who could not get into the army at all 
1131,by the next autumn she was gay again  gay as ever 
1132,she had a debut after the armistice  and in february she was presumably engaged to a man from new orleans 
1133,in june she married tom buchanan of chicago with more pomp and circumstance than louisville ever knew before 
1134,he came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the seelbach hotel  and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
1135,i was bridesmaid 
1136,i came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner  and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the june night in her flowered dress and as drunk as a monkey 
1137,she had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other 
1138,   gratulate me   she muttered 
1139, never had a drink before but oh  how i do enjoy it  
1140, what is the matter  daisy  
1141,i was scared  i can tell you  I would never seen a girl like that before 
1142, here  dearis  
1143,she groped around in a waste basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls 
1144, take  them downstairs and give  them back to whoever they belong to  tell  them all daisy own change  her mine  say  daisy own change  her mine    
1145,she began to cry she cried and cried 
1146,i rushed out and found her mother own maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath 
1147,she would not let go of the letter 
1148,she took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball  and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow 
1149,but she did not say another word 
1150,we gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over 
1151,next day at five of the clock she married tom buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months  trip to the south seas 
1152,i saw them in santa barbara when they came back and i thought I would never seen a girl so mad about her husband 
1153,if he left the room for a minute she would look around uneasily and say  where is tom gone   and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door 
1154,she used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight 
1155,it was touching to see them together it made you laugh in a hushed  fascinated way 
1156,that was in august 
1157,a week after i left santa barbara tom ran into a wagon on the ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car 
1158,the girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken she was one of the chambermaids in the santa barbara hotel 
1159,the next april daisy had her little girl and they went to france for a year 
1160,i saw them one spring in cannes and later in deauville and then they came back to chicago to settle down 
1161,daisy was popular in chicago  as you know 
1162,they moved with a fast crowd  all of them young and rich and wild  but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation 
1163,perhaps because she does not drink 
1164,it is a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people 
1165,you can hold your tongue and  moreover  you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they do not see or care 
1166,perhaps daisy never went in for amour at all and yet there is something in that voice of hers       
1167,well  about six weeks ago  she heard the name gatsby for the first time in years 
1168,it was when i asked you do you remember 
1169,if you knew gatsby in west egg 
1170,after you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up  and said  what gatsby   and when i described him i was half asleep she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know 
1171,it was not until then that i connected this gatsby with the officer in her white car 
1172,when jordan baker had finished telling all this we had left the plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through central park 
1173,the sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the west fifties and the clear voices of girls  already gathered like crickets on the grass  rose through the hot twilight 
1174,i  the sheik of araby  your love belongs to me 
1175,at night when you are asleep  into your tent i  creep
1176, it was a strange coincidence   i said 
1177, but it was not a coincidence at all  
1178, why not  
1179, gatsby bought that house so that daisy would be just across the bay  
1180,then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that june night 
1181,he came alive to me  delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor 
1182, he wants to know   continued jordan   if you  invite daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over  
1183,the modesty of the demand shook me 
1184,he had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could  come over  some afternoon to a stranger own garden 
1185, did i have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing  
1186, he is afraid  he is waited so long  he thought you might be offended  you see he is a regular tough underneath it all  
1187,something worried me 
1188, why did not he ask you to arrange a meeting  
1189, he wants her to see his house   she explained 
1190, and your house is right next door  
1191, i think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties  some night   went on jordan   but she never did 
1192,then he began asking people casually if they knew her  and i was the first one he found 
1193,it was that night he sent for me at his dance  and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it 
1194,of course  i immediately suggested a luncheon in new york and i thought he would go mad 
1195,   i do not want to do anything out of the way   he kept saying 
1196, i want to see her right next door  
1197, when i said you were a particular friend of tom own he started to abandon the whole idea  he does not know very much about tom  though he says he is read a chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of daisy own name  
1198,it was dark now  and as we dipped under a little bridge i put my arm around jordan own golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner 
1199,suddenly i was not thinking of daisy and gatsby any more but of this clean  hard  limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm 
1200,a phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement   there are only the pursued  the pursuing  the busy and the tired  
1201, and daisy ought to have something in her life   murmured jordan to me 
1202, does she want to see gatsby  
1203, she is not to know about it  gatsby does not want her to know  you are just supposed to invite her to tea  
1204,we passed a barrier of dark trees  and then the facade of fifty ninth street  a block of delicate pale light  beamed down into the park 
1205,unlike gatsby and tom buchanan i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so i drew up the girl beside me  tightening my arms 
1206,her wan  scornful mouth smiled and so i drew her up again  closer  this time to my face 
1207,when i came home to west egg that night i was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire 
1208,two of the clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires 
1209,turning a corner i saw that it was gatsby own house  lit from tower to cellar 
1210,at first i thought it was another party  a wild rout that had resolved itself into  hide and go seek  or  sardines in the box  with all the house thrown open to the game 
1211,but there was not a sound 
1212,only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness 
1213,as my taxi groaned away i saw gatsby walking toward me across his lawn 
1214, your place looks like the world own fair   i said 
1215, does it  
1216,he turned his eyes toward it absently 
1217, i have been glancing into some of the rooms  let us go to coney island  old sport  in my car  
1218, it is too late  
1219, well  suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool  i have not made use of it all summer  
1220, I have got to go to bed  
1221, all right  
1222,he waited  looking at me with suppressed eagerness 
1223, i talked with miss baker   i said after a moment 
1224, i  going to call up daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea  
1225, oh  that is all right   he said carelessly 
1226, i do not want to put you to any trouble  
1227, what day would suit you  
1228, what day would suit you   he corrected me quickly 
1229, i do not want to put you to any trouble  you see  
1230, how about the day after tomorrow  
1231,he considered for a moment 
1232,then  with reluctance 
1233, i want to get the grass cut   he said 
1234,we both looked at the grass there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker  well kept expanse of his began 
1235,i suspected that he meant my grass 
1236, there is another little thing   he said uncertainly  and hesitated 
1237, would you rather put it off for a few days  
1238,i asked 
1239, oh  it is not about that  at least  
1240,he fumbled with a series of beginnings 
1241, why  i thought why  look here  old sport  you do not make much money  do you  
1242, not very much  
1243,this seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently 
1244, i thought you did not  if you  pardon my you see  i carry on a little business on the side  a sort of sideline  you understand  and i thought that if you do not make very much you are selling bonds  are not you  old sport  
1245, trying to  
1246, well  this would interest you  it would not take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money  it happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing  
1247,i realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life 
1248,but  because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered  i had no choice except to cut him off there 
1249, I have got my hands full   i said 
1250, i  much obliged but i could not take on any more work  
1251, you would not have to do any business with wolfshiem  
1252,evidently he thought that i was shying away from the  gonnegtion  mentioned at lunch  but i assured him he was wrong 
1253,he waited a moment longer  hoping I would begin a conversation  but i was too absorbed to be responsive  so he went unwillingly home 
1254,the evening had made me light headed and happy  i think i walked into a deep sleep as i entered my front door 
1255,so i did not know whether or not gatsby went to coney island or for how many hours he  glanced into rooms  while his house blazed gaudily on 
1256,i called up daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea 
1257, do not bring tom   i warned her 
1258, what  
1259, do not bring tom  
1260, who is  tom    she asked innocently 
1261,the day agreed upon was pouring rain 
1262,at eleven of the clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn mower tapped at my front door and said that mr  gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass 
1263,this reminded me that i had forgotten to tell my finn to come back so i drove into west egg village to search for her among soggy white washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers 
1264,the flowers were unnecessary  for at two of the clock a greenhouse arrived from gatsby own  with innumerable receptacles to contain it 
1265,an hour later the front door opened nervously  and gatsby in a white flannel suit  silver shirt and gold colored tie hurried in 
1266,he was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes 
1267, is everything all right   he asked immediately 
1268, the grass looks fine  if that is what you mean  
1269, what grass   he inquired blankly 
1270, oh  the grass in the yard  
1271,he looked out the window at it  but judging from his expression i do not believe he saw a thing 
1272, looks very good   he remarked vaguely 
1273, one of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four  i think it was  the journal   have you got everything you need in the shape of of tea  
1274,i took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the finn 
1275,together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop 
1276, will they do  
1277,i asked 
1278, of course  of course  they are fine   and he added hollowly        old sport  
1279,the rain cooled about half past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew 
1280,gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of clay own  economics   starting at the finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside 
1281,finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home 
1282, why is that  
1283, nobody own coming to tea  it is too late  
1284,he looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere 
1285, i cannot wait all day  
1286, do not be silly  it is just two minutes to four  
1287,he sat down  miserably  as if i had pushed him  and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane 
1288,we both jumped up and  a little harrowed myself  i went out into the yard 
1289,under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive 
1290,it stopped 
1291,daisy own face  tipped sideways beneath a three cornered lavender hat  looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile 
1292, is this absolutely where you live  my dearest one  
1293,the exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain 
1294,i had to follow the sound of it for a moment  up and down  with my ear alone before any words came through 
1295,a damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as i took it to help her from the car 
1296, are you in love with me   she said low in my ear 
1297, or why did i have to come alone  
1298, that is the secret of castle rackrent  tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour  
1299, come back in an hour  ferdie  
1300,then in a grave murmur   his name is ferdie  
1301, does the gasoline affect his nose  
1302, i do not think so   she said innocently 
1303, why  
1304,we went in 
1305,to my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted 
1306, well  that is funny  
1307,i exclaimed 
1308, what is funny  
1309,she turned her head as there was a light  dignified knocking at the front door 
1310,i went out and opened it 
1311,gatsby  pale as death  with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets  was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes 
1312,with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall  turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room 
1313,it was not a bit funny 
1314,aware of the loud beating of my own heart i pulled the door to against the increasing rain 
1315,for half a minute there was not a sound 
1316,then from the living room i heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by daisy own voice on a clear artificial note 
1317, i certainly am awfully glad to see you again  
1318,a pause  it endured horribly 
1319,i had nothing to do in the hall so i went into the room 
1320,gatsby  his hands still in his pockets  was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease  even of boredom 
1321,his head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair 
1322, we have met before   muttered gatsby 
1323,his eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh 
1324,luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head  whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place 
1325,then he sat down  rigidly  his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand 
1326, i  sorry about the clock   he said 
1327,my own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn 
1328,i could not muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head 
1329, it is an old clock   i told them idiotically 
1330,i think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor 
1331, we have not met for many years   said daisy  her voice as matter of fact as it could ever be 
1332, five years next november  
1333,the automatic quality of gatsby own answer set us all back at least another minute 
1334,i had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac finn brought it in on a tray 
1335,amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself 
1336,gatsby got himself into a shadow and while daisy and i talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes 
1337,however  as calmness was not an end in itself i made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet 
1338, where are you going   demanded gatsby in immediate alarm 
1339, i  be back  
1340, I have got to speak to you about something before you go  
1341,he followed me wildly into the kitchen  closed the door and whispered   oh  god   in a miserable way 
1342, what is the matter  
1343, this is a terrible mistake   he said  shaking his head from side to side   a terrible  terrible mistake  
1344, you are just embarrassed  that is all   and luckily i added   daisy own embarrassed too  
1345, she is embarrassed   he repeated incredulously 
1346, just as much as you are  
1347, do not talk so loud  
1348, you are acting like a little boy   i broke out impatiently 
1349, not only that but you are rude  daisy own sitting in there all alone  
1350,he raised his hand to stop my words  looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room 
1351,i walked out the back way just as gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain 
1352,once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn  well shaved by gatsby own gardener  abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes 
1353,there was nothing to look at from under the tree except gatsby own enormous house  so i stared at it  like kant at his church steeple  for half an hour 
1354,a brewer had built it early in the  period  craze  a decade before  and there was a story that he would agreed to pay five years  taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw 
1355,perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to found a family he went into an immediate decline 
1356,his children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door 
1357,americans  while occasionally willing to be serfs  have always been obstinate about being peasantry 
1358,after half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer own automobile rounded gatsby own drive with the raw material for his servants  dinner i felt sure he would not eat a spoonful 
1359,a maid began opening the upper windows of his house  appeared momentarily in each  and  leaning from a large central bay  spat meditatively into the garden 
1360,it was time i went back 
1361,while the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices  rising and swelling a little  now and then  with gusts of emotion 
1362,but in the new silence i felt that silence had fallen within the house too 
1363,i went in after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove but i do not believe they heard a sound 
1364,they were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air  and every vestige of embarrassment was gone 
1365,daisy own face was smeared with tears and when i came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror 
1366,but there was a change in gatsby that was simply confounding 
1367,he literally glowed  without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well being radiated from him and filled the little room 
1368, oh  hello  old sport   he said  as if he had not seen me for years 
1369,i thought for a moment he was going to shake hands 
1370, it is stopped raining  
1371, has it  
1372,when he realized what i was talking about  that there were twinkle bells of sunshine in the room  he smiled like a weather man  like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light  and repeated the news to daisy 
1373, what do you think of that  it is stopped raining  
1374, i  glad  jay  
1375,her throat  full of aching  grieving beauty  told only of her unexpected joy 
1376, i want you and daisy to come over to my house   he said   I would like to show her around  
1377, you are sure you want me to come  
1378, absolutely  old sport  
1379,daisy went upstairs to wash her face too late i thought with humiliation of my towels while gatsby and i waited on the lawn 
1380, my house looks well  does not it   he demanded 
1381, see how the whole front of it catches the light  
1382,i agreed that it was splendid 
1383, yes  
1384,his eyes went over it  every arched door and square tower 
1385, it took me just three years to earn the money that bought it  
1386, i thought you inherited your money  
1387, i did  old sport   he said automatically   but i lost most of it in the big panic the panic of the war  
1388,i think he hardly knew what he was saying  for when i asked him what business he was in he answered  that is my affair   before he realized that it was not the appropriate reply 
1389, oh  I have been in several things   he corrected himself 
1390, i was in the drug business and then i was in the oil business  but i  not in either one now  
1391,he looked at me with more attention 
1392, do you mean you have been thinking over what i proposed the other night  
1393,before i could answer  daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight 
1394, that huge place there   she cried pointing 
1395, do you like it  
1396, i love it  but i do not see how you live there all alone  
1397, i keep it always full of interesting people  night and day  people who do interesting things  celebrated people  
1398,instead of taking the short cut along the sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern 
1399,with enchanting murmurs daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky  admired the gardens  the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss me at the gate 
1400,it was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door  and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees 
1401,and inside as we wandered through marie antoinette music rooms and restoration salons i felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table  under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through 
1402,as gatsby closed the door of  the merton college library  i could have sworn i heard the owl eyed man break into ghostly laughter 
1403,we went upstairs  through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers  through dressing rooms and poolrooms  and bathrooms with sunken baths intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor 
1404,it was mr  klipspringer  the  boarder  
1405,i had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning 
1406,finally we came to gatsby own own apartment  a bedroom and a bath and an adam study  where we sat down and drank a glass of some chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall 
1407,he had not once ceased looking at daisy and i think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well loved eyes 
1408,sometimes  too  he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real 
1409,once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs 
1410,his bedroom was the simplest room of all except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold 
1411,daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair  whereupon gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh 
1412, it is the funniest thing  old sport   he said hilariously 
1413, i cannot when i try to  
1414,he had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third 
1415,after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence 
1416,he had been full of the idea so long  dreamed it right through to the end  waited with his teeth set  so to speak  at an inconceivable pitch of intensity 
1417,now  in the reaction  he was running down like an overwound clock 
1418,recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing gowns and ties  and his shirts  piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high 
1419, I have got a man in england who buys me clothes  he sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season  spring and fall  
1420,he took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them  one by one before us  shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many colored disarray 
1421,while we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue 
1422,suddenly with a strained sound  daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily 
1423, they are such beautiful shirts   she sobbed  her voice muffled in the thick folds 
1424, it makes me sad because I have never seen such such beautiful shirts before  
1425,after the house  we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool  and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers but outside gatsby own window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the sound 
1426, if it was not for the mist we could see your home across the bay   said gatsby 
1427, you always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock  
1428,daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said 
1429,possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever 
1430,compared to the great distance that had separated him from daisy it had seemed very near to her  almost touching her 
1431,it had seemed as close as a star to the moon 
1432,now it was again a green light on a dock 
1433,his count of enchanted objects had diminished by one 
1434,i began to walk about the room  examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness 
1435,a large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me  hung on the wall over his desk 
1436, who is this  
1437, that  that is mr  dan cody  old sport  
1438,the name sounded faintly familiar 
1439, he is dead now  he used to be my best friend years ago  
1440,there was a small picture of gatsby  also in yachting costume  on the bureau gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly taken apparently when he was about eighteen 
1441, i adore it   exclaimed daisy 
1442, the pompadour  you never told me you had a pompadour or a yacht  
1443, look at this   said gatsby quickly 
1444, here is a lot of clippings about you  
1445,they stood side by side examining it 
1446,i was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and gatsby took up the receiver 
1447, yes        well  i cannot talk now        i cannot talk now  old sport        i said a small town        he must know what a small town is        well  he is no use to us if detroit is his idea of a small town        
1448,he rang off 
1449, come here quick   cried daisy at the window 
1450,the rain was still falling  but the darkness had parted in the west  and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea 
1451, look at that   she whispered  and then after a moment   I would like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around  
1452,i tried to go then  but they would not hear of it  perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone 
1453, i know what we  do   said gatsby   we  have klipspringer play the piano  
1454,he went out of the room calling  ewing   and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed  slightly worn young man with she will rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair 
1455,he was now decently clothed in a  sport shirt  open at the neck  sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue 
1456, did we interrupt your exercises   inquired daisy politely 
1457, i was asleep   cried mr  klipspringer  in a spasm of embarrassment 
1458, that is  I would been asleep  then i got up        
1459, klipspringer plays the piano   said gatsby  cutting him off 
1460, do not you  ewing  old sport  
1461, i do not play well  i do not i hardly play at all  i  all out of prac  
1462, we  go downstairs   interrupted gatsby 
1463,he flipped a switch 
1464,the grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light 
1465,in the music room gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano 
1466,he lit daisy own cigarette from a trembling match  and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall 
1467,when klipspringer had played  the love nest  he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for gatsby in the gloom 
1468, i  all out of practice  you see  i told you i could not play  i  all out of prac  
1469, do not talk so much  old sport   commanded gatsby 
1470, play  
1471,in the morning  in the evening  are not we got fun
1472,outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the sound 
1473,all the lights were going on in west egg now  the electric trains  men carrying  were plunging home through the rain from new york 
1474,it was the hour of a profound human change  and excitement was generating on the air 
1475,one thing own sure and nothing own surer the rich get richer and the poor get children 
1476,in the meantime  in between time
1477,as i went over to say goodbye i saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into gatsby own face  as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness 
1478,almost five years 
1479,there must have been moments even that afternoon when daisy tumbled short of his dreams not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion 
1480,it had gone beyond her  beyond everything 
1481,he had thrown himself into it with a creative passion  adding to it all the time  decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way 
1482,no amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart 
1483,as i watched him he adjusted himself a little  visibly 
1484,his hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion 
1485,i think that voice held him most with its fluctuating  feverish warmth because it could not be over dreamed that voice was a deathless song 
1486,they had forgotten me  but daisy glanced up and held out her hand  gatsby did not know me now at all 
1487,i looked once more at them and they looked back at me  remotely  possessed by intense life 
1488,then i went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain  leaving them there together 
1489,about this time an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one morning at gatsby own door and asked him if he had anything to say 
1490, anything to say about what   inquired gatsby politely 
1491, why  any statement to give out  
1492,it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard gatsby own name around his office in a connection which he either would not reveal or did not fully understand 
1493,this was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out  to see  
1494,it was a random shot  and yet the reporter own instinct was right 
1495,gatsby own notoriety  spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past  had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news 
1496,contemporary legends such as the  underground pipe line to canada  attached themselves to him  and there was one persistent story that he did not live in a house at all  but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the long island shore 
1497,just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota  is not easy to say 
1498,james gatz that was really  or at least legally  his name 
1499,he had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career when he saw dan cody own yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior 
1500,it was james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants  but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a row boat  pulled out to the tuolomee and informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour 
1501,i suppose he would had the name ready for a long time  even then 
1502,his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all 
1503,the truth was that jay gatsby  of west egg  long island  sprang from his platonic conception of himself 
1504,he was a son of god a phrase which  if it means anything  means just that and he must be about his father own business  the service of a vast  vulgar and meretricious beauty 
1505,so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen year old boy would be likely to invent  and to this conception he was faithful to the end 
1506,for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of lake superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed 
1507,his brown  hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce  half lazy work of the bracing days 
1508,he knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them  of young virgins because they were ignorant  of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self absorption he took for granted 
1509,but his heart was in a constant  turbulent riot 
1510,the most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night 
1511,a universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor 
1512,each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace 
1513,for a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination  they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality  a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy own wing 
1514,an instinct toward his future glory had led him  some months before  to the small lutheran college of st  olaf in southern minnesota 
1515,he stayed there two weeks  dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny  to destiny itself  and despising the janitor own work with which he was to pay his way through 
1516,then he drifted back to lake superior  and he was still searching for something to do on the day that dan cody own yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore 
1517,cody was fifty years old then  a product of the nevada silver fields  of the yukon  of every rush for metal since seventy five 
1518,the transactions in montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft mindedness  and  suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money 
1519,the none too savory ramifications by which ella kaye  the newspaper woman  played madame de maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht  were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of  
1520,he had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as james gatz own destiny at little girl bay 
1521,to the young gatz  resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck  the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world 
1522,i suppose he smiled at cody he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled 
1523,at any rate cody asked him a few questions  one of them elicited the brand new name  and found that he was quick  and extravagantly ambitious 
1524,a few days later he took him to duluth and bought him a blue coat  six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap 
1525,and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the barbary coast gatsby left too 
1526,he was employed in a vague personal capacity while he remained with cody he was in turn steward  mate  skipper  secretary  and even jailor  for dan cody sober knew what lavish doings dan cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in gatsby 
1527,the arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent 
1528,it might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that ella kaye came on board one night in boston and a week later dan cody inhospitably died 
1529,i remember the portrait of him up in gatsby own bedroom  a grey  florid man with a hard empty face the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon 
1530,it was indirectly due to cody that gatsby drank so little 
1531,sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair  for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone 
1532,and it was from cody that he inherited money a legacy of twenty five thousand dollars 
1533,he did not get it 
1534,he never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to ella kaye 
1535,he was left with his singularly appropriate education  the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man 
1536,he told me all this very much later  but I have put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents  which were not even faintly true 
1537,moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion  when i had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him 
1538,so i take advantage of this short halt  while gatsby  so to speak  caught his breath  to clear this set of misconceptions away 
1539,it was a halt  too  in my association with his affairs 
1540,for several weeks i did not see him or hear his voice on the phone mostly i was in new york  trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt but finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon 
1541,i had not been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink 
1542,i was startled  naturally  but the really surprising thing was that it had not happened before 
1543,they were a party of three on horseback tom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously 
1544, i  delighted to see you   said gatsby standing on his porch 
1545, i  delighted that you dropped in  
1546,as though they cared 
1547, sit right down  have a cigarette or a cigar  
1548,he walked around the room quickly  ringing bells 
1549, i  have something to drink for you in just a minute  
1550,he was profoundly affected by the fact that tom was there 
1551,but he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something  realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for 
1552,mr  sloane wanted nothing 
1553,a lemonade 
1554,no  thanks 
1555,a little champagne 
1556,nothing at all  thanks 
1557,      i  sorry
1558, did you have a nice ride  
1559, very good roads around here  
1560, i suppose the automobiles  
1561, yeah  
1562,moved by an irresistible impulse  gatsby turned to tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger 
1563, i believe we have met somewhere before  mr  buchanan  
1564, oh  yes   said tom  gruffly polite but obviously not remembering 
1565, so we did  i remember very well  
1566, about two weeks ago  
1567, that is right  you were with nick here  
1568, i know your wife   continued gatsby  almost aggressively 
1569, that so  
1570,tom turned to me 
1571, you live near here  nick  
1572, next door  
1573, that so  
1574,mr  sloane did not enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair  the woman said nothing either until unexpectedly  after two highballs  she became cordial 
1575, we  all come over to your next party  mr  gatsby   she suggested 
1576, what do you say  
1577, certainly  I would be delighted to have you  
1578, be ver  nice   said mr  sloane  without gratitude 
1579, well think ought to be starting home  
1580, please do not hurry   gatsby urged them 
1581,he had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of tom 
1582, why do not you why do not you stay for supper  i would not be surprised if some other people dropped in from new york  
1583, you come to supper with me   said the lady enthusiastically 
1584, both of you  
1585,this included me 
1586,mr  sloane got to his feet 
1587, come along   he said but to her only 
1588, i mean it   she insisted 
1589, I would love to have you  lots of room  
1590,gatsby looked at me questioningly 
1591,he wanted to go and he did not see that mr  sloane had determined he should not 
1592, i  afraid i will not be able to   i said 
1593, well  you come   she urged  concentrating on gatsby 
1594,mr  sloane murmured something close to her ear 
1595, we will not be late if we start now   she insisted aloud 
1596, i have not got a horse   said gatsby 
1597, i used to ride in the army but I have never bought a horse  i  have to follow you in my car  excuse me for just a minute  
1598,the rest of us walked out on the porch  where sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside 
1599, my god  i believe the man own coming   said tom 
1600, does not he know she does not want him  
1601, she says she does want him  
1602, she has a big dinner party and he will not know a soul there  
1603,he frowned 
1604, i wonder where in the devil he met daisy  by god  i may be old fashioned in my ideas  but women run around too much these days to suit me  they meet all kinds of crazy fish  
1605,suddenly mr  sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses 
1606, come on   said mr  sloane to tom   we are late  we have got to go  
1607,and then to me   tell him we could not wait  will you  
1608,tom and i shook hands  the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive  disappearing under the august foliage just as gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door 
1609,tom was evidently perturbed at daisy own running around alone  for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsby own party 
1610,perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness it stands out in my memory from gatsby own other parties that summer 
1611,there were the same people  or at least the same sort of people  the same profusion of champagne  the same many colored  many keyed commotion  but i felt an unpleasantness in the air  a pervading harshness that had not been there before 
1612,or perhaps i had merely grown used to it  grown to accept west egg as a world complete in itself  with its own standards and its own great figures  second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so  and now i was looking at it again  through daisy own eyes 
1613,it is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment 
1614,they arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds daisy own voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat 
1615, these things excite me so   she whispered 
1616, if you want to kiss me any time during the evening  nick  just let me know and i  be glad to arrange it for you  just mention my name  or present a green card  i  giving out green  
1617, look around   suggested gatsby 
1618, i  looking around  i  having a marvelous  
1619, you must see the faces of many people you have heard about  
1620,tom own arrogant eyes roamed the crowd 
1621, we do not go around very much   he said 
1622, in fact i was just thinking i do not know a soul here  
1623, perhaps you know that lady  
1624,gatsby indicated a gorgeous  scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree 
1625,tom and daisy stared  with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies 
1626, she is lovely   said daisy 
1627, the man bending over her is her director  
1628,he took them ceremoniously from group to group 
1629, mrs  buchanan       and mr  buchanan  
1630,after an instant own hesitation he added   the polo player  
1631, oh no   objected tom quickly   not me  
1632,but evidently the sound of it pleased gatsby for tom remained  the polo player  for the rest of the evening 
1633, I have never met so many celebrities  
1634,daisy exclaimed 
1635, i liked that man what was his name  with the sort of blue nose  
1636,gatsby identified him  adding that he was a small producer 
1637, well  i liked him anyhow  
1638, I would a little rather not be the polo player   said tom pleasantly   I would rather look at all these famous people in in oblivion  
1639,daisy and gatsby danced 
1640,i remember being surprised by his graceful  conservative fox trot i had never seen him dance before 
1641,then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request i remained watchfully in the garden   in case there is a fire or a flood   she explained   or any act of god  
1642,tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together 
1643, do you mind if i eat with some people over here   he said 
1644, a fellow own getting off some funny stuff  
1645, go ahead   answered daisy genially   and if you want to take down any addresses here is my little gold pencil        
1646,she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was  common but pretty   and i knew that except for the half hour she would been alone with gatsby she was not having a good time 
1647,we were at a particularly tipsy table 
1648,that was my fault gatsby had been called to the phone and I would enjoyed these same people only two weeks before 
1649,but what had amused me then turned septic on the air now 
1650, how do you feel  miss baedeker  
1651,the girl addressed was trying  unsuccessfully  to slump against my shoulder 
1652,at this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes 
1653, wha  
1654,a massive and lethargic woman  who had been urging daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow  spoke in miss baedeker own defence 
1655, oh  she is all right now  when she is had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that  i tell her she ought to leave it alone  
1656, i do leave it alone   affirmed the accused hollowly 
1657, we heard you yelling  so i said to doc civet here   there is somebody that needs your help  doc    
1658, she is much obliged  i  sure   said another friend  without gratitude 
1659, but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool  
1660, anything i hate is to get my head stuck in a pool   mumbled miss baedeker 
1661, they almost drowned me once over in new jersey  
1662, then you ought to leave it alone   countered doctor civet 
1663, speak for yourself   cried miss baedeker violently 
1664, your hand shakes  i would not let you operate on me  
1665,it was like that 
1666,almost the last thing i remember was standing with daisy and watching the moving picture director and his star 
1667,they were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between 
1668,it occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity  and even while i watched i saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek 
1669, i like her   said daisy   i think she is lovely  
1670,but the rest offended her and inarguably  because it was not a gesture but an emotion 
1671,she was appalled by west egg  this unprecedented  place  that broadway had begotten upon a long island fishing village appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing 
1672,she saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand 
1673,i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car 
1674,it was dark here in front  only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning 
1675,sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing room blind above  gave way to another shadow  an indefinite procession of shadows  who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass 
1676, who is this gatsby anyhow   demanded tom suddenly 
1677, some big bootlegger  
1678, where did you hear that  
1679,i inquired 
1680, i did not hear it  i imagined it  a lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers  you know  
1681, not gatsby   i said shortly 
1682,he was silent for a moment 
1683,the pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet 
1684, well  he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together  
1685,a breeze stirred the grey haze of daisy own fur collar 
1686, at least they are more interesting than the people we know   she said with an effort 
1687, you did not look so interested  
1688, well  i was  
1689,tom laughed and turned to me 
1690, did you notice daisy own face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower  
1691,daisy began to sing with the music in a husky  rhythmic whisper  bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again 
1692,when the melody rose  her voice broke up sweetly  following it  in a way contralto voices have  and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air 
1693, lots of people come who have not been invited   she said suddenly 
1694, that girl had not been invited  they simply force their way in and he is too polite to object  
1695, I would like to know who he is and what he does   insisted tom 
1696, and i think i  make a point of finding out  
1697, i can tell you right now   she answered 
1698, he owned some drug stores  a lot of drug stores  he built them up himself  
1699,the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive 
1700, good night  nick   said daisy 
1701,her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where  three of the clock in the morning   a neat  sad little waltz of that year  was drifting out the open door 
1702,after all  in the very casualness of gatsby own party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world 
1703,what was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside 
1704,what would happen now in the dim incalculable hours 
1705,perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive  a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at  some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at gatsby  one moment of magical encounter  would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion 
1706,i stayed late that night 
1707,gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up  chilled and exalted  from the black beach  until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead 
1708,when he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face  and his eyes were bright and tired 
1709, she did not like it   he said immediately 
1710, of course she did  
1711, she did not like it   he insisted 
1712, she did not have a good time  
1713,he was silent and i guessed at his unutterable depression 
1714, i feel far away from her   he said 
1715, it is hard to make her understand  
1716, you mean about the dance  
1717, the dance  
1718,he dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers 
1719, old sport  the dance is unimportant  
1720,he wanted nothing less of daisy than that she should go to tom and say   i never loved you  
1721,after she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken 
1722,one of them was that  after she was free  they were to go back to louisville and be married from her house just as if it were five years ago 
1723, and she does not understand   he said 
1724, she used to be able to understand  we would sit for hours  
1725,he broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers 
1726, i would not ask too much of her   i ventured 
1727, you cannot repeat the past  
1728, cannot repeat the past   he cried incredulously 
1729, why of course you can  
1730,he looked around him wildly  as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house  just out of reach of his hand 
1731, i  going to fix everything just the way it was before   he said  nodding determinedly 
1732, she  see  
1733,he talked a lot about the past and i gathered that he wanted to recover something  some idea of himself perhaps  that had gone into loving daisy 
1734,his life had been confused and disordered since then  but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly  he could find out what that thing was       
1735,one autumn night  five years before  they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling  and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight 
1736,they stopped here and turned toward each other 
1737,now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year 
1738,the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars 
1739,out of the corner of his eye gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees he could climb to it  if he climbed alone  and once there he could suck on the pap of life  gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder 
1740,his heart beat faster and faster as daisy own white face came up to his own 
1741,he knew that when he kissed this girl  and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath  his mind would never romp again like the mind of god 
1742,so he waited  listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star 
1743,then he kissed her 
1744,at his lips  touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete 
1745,through all he said  even through his appalling sentimentality  i was reminded of something an elusive rhythm  a fragment of lost words  that i had heard somewhere a long time ago 
1746,for a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man own  as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air 
1747,but they made no sound and what i had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever 
1748,it was when curiosity about gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one saturday night and  as obscurely as it had begun  his career as trimalchio was over 
1749,only gradually did i become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away 
1750,wondering if he were sick i went over to find out an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door 
1751, is mr  gatsby sick  
1752, nope  
1753,after a pause he added  sir  in a dilatory  grudging way 
1754, i had not seen him around  and i was rather worried  tell him mr  carraway came over  
1755, who   he demanded rudely 
1756, carraway  
1757, carraway  all right  i  tell him  
1758,abruptly he slammed the door 
1759,my finn informed me that gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others  who never went into west egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen  but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone 
1760,the grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty  and the general opinion in the village was that the new people were not servants at all 
1761,next day gatsby called me on the phone 
1762, going away  
1763,i inquired 
1764, no  old sport  
1765, i hear you fired all your servants  
1766, i wanted somebody who would not gossip  daisy comes over quite often in the afternoons  
1767,so the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes 
1768, they are some people wolfshiem wanted to do something for  they are all brothers and sisters  they used to run a small hotel  
1769, i see  
1770,he was calling up at daisy own request would i come to lunch at her house tomorrow 
1771,miss baker would be there 
1772,half an hour later daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that i was coming 
1773,something was up 
1774,and yet i could not believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene especially for the rather harrowing scene that gatsby had outlined in the garden 
1775,the next day was broiling  almost the last  certainly the warmest  of the summer 
1776,as my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight  only the hot whistles of the national biscuit company broke the simmering hush at noon 
1777,the straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion  the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist  and then  as her newspaper dampened under her fingers  lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry 
1778,her pocket book slapped to the floor 
1779, oh  my   she gasped 
1780,i picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her  holding it at arm own length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that i had no designs upon it but every one near by  including the woman  suspected me just the same 
1781, hot   said the conductor to familiar faces 
1782, some weather  hot  hot  hot  is it hot enough for you  is it hot  is it         
1783,my commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand 
1784,that any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed  whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart 
1785,through the hall of the buchanans  house blew a faint wind  carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to gatsby and me as we waited at the door 
1786, the master own body   roared the butler into the mouthpiece 
1787, i  sorry  madame  but we cannot furnish it it is far too hot to touch this noon  
1788,what he really said was   yes       yes       i  see  
1789,he set down the receiver and came toward us  glistening slightly  to take our stiff straw hats 
1790, madame expects you in the salon   he cried  needlessly indicating the direction 
1791,in this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life 
1792,the room  shadowed well with awnings  was dark and cool 
1793,daisy and jordan lay upon an enormous couch  like silver idols  weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans 
1794, we cannot move   they said together 
1795,jordan own fingers  powdered white over their tan  rested for a moment in mine 
1796, and mr  thomas buchanan  the athlete  
1797,i inquired 
1798,simultaneously i heard his voice  gruff  muffled  husky  at the hall telephone 
1799,gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes 
1800,daisy watched him and laughed  her sweet  exciting laugh  a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air 
1801, the rumor is   whispered jordan   that that is tom own girl on the telephone  
1802,we were silent 
1803,the voice in the hall rose high with annoyance 
1804, very well  then  i will not sell you the car at all        i  under no obligations to you at all        and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time i will not stand that at all  
1805, holding down the receiver   said daisy cynically 
1806, no  he is not   i assured her 
1807, it is a bona fide deal  i happen to know about it  
1808,tom flung open the door  blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body  and hurried into the room 
1809, mr  gatsby  
1810,he put out his broad  flat hand with well concealed dislike 
1811, i  glad to see you  sir        nick        
1812, make us a cold drink   cried daisy 
1813,as he left the room again she got up and went over to gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth 
1814, you know i love you   she murmured 
1815, you forget there is a lady present   said jordan 
1816,daisy looked around doubtfully 
1817, you kiss nick too  
1818, what a low  vulgar girl  
1819, i do not care   cried daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace 
1820,then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room 
1821, bles sed pre cious   she crooned  holding out her arms 
1822, come to your own mother that loves you  
1823,the child  relinquished by the nurse  rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother own dress 
1824, the bles sed pre cious  did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair  stand up now  and say how de do  
1825,gatsby and i in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand 
1826,afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise 
1827,i do not think he had ever really believed in its existence before 
1828, i got dressed before luncheon   said the child  turning eagerly to daisy 
1829, that is because your mother wanted to show you off  
1830,her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck 
1831, you dream  you  you absolute little dream  
1832, yes   admitted the child calmly 
1833, aunt jordan own got on a white dress too  
1834, how do you like mother own friends  
1835,daisy turned her around so that she faced gatsby 
1836, do you think they are pretty  
1837, where is daddy  
1838, she does not look like her father   explained daisy 
1839, she looks like me  she is got my hair and shape of the face  
1840,daisy sat back upon the couch 
1841,the nurse took a step forward and held out her hand 
1842, come  pammy  
1843, goodbye  sweetheart  
1844,with a reluctant backward glance the well disciplined child held to her nurse own hand and was pulled out the door  just as tom came back  preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice 
1845,gatsby took up his drink 
1846, they certainly look cool   he said  with visible tension 
1847,we drank in long greedy swallows 
1848, i read somewhere that the sun own getting hotter every year   said tom genially 
1849, it seems that pretty soon the earth own going to fall into the sun or wait a minute it is just the opposite the sun own getting colder every year 
1850, come outside   he suggested to gatsby   I would like you to have a look at the place  
1851,i went with them out to the veranda 
1852,on the green sound  stagnant in the heat  one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea 
1853,gatsby own eyes followed it momentarily  he raised his hand and pointed across the bay 
1854, i  right across from you  
1855, so you are  
1856,our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore 
1857,slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky 
1858,ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles 
1859, there is sport for you   said tom  nodding 
1860, I would like to be out there with him for about an hour  
1861,we had luncheon in the dining room  darkened  too  against the heat  and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale 
1862, what  we do with ourselves this afternoon   cried daisy   and the day after that  and the next thirty years  
1863, do not be morbid   jordan said 
1864, life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall  
1865, but it is so hot   insisted daisy  on the verge of tears   and everything own so confused  let us all go to town  
1866,her voice struggled on through the heat  beating against it  moulding its senselessness into forms 
1867, I have heard of making a garage out of a stable   tom was saying to gatsby   but i  the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage  
1868, who wants to go to town   demanded daisy insistently 
1869,gatsby own eyes floated toward her 
1870, ah   she cried   you look so cool  
1871,their eyes met  and they stared together at each other  alone in space 
1872,with an effort she glanced down at the table 
1873, you always look so cool   she repeated 
1874,she had told him that she loved him  and tom buchanan saw 
1875,he was astounded 
1876,his mouth opened a little and he looked at gatsby and then back at daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago 
1877, you resemble the advertisement of the man   she went on innocently 
1878, you know the advertisement of the man  
1879, all right   broke in tom quickly   i  perfectly willing to go to town  come on we are all going to town  
1880,he got up  his eyes still flashing between gatsby and his wife 
1881,no one moved 
1882, come on  
1883,his temper cracked a little 
1884, what is the matter  anyhow  if we are going to town let us start  
1885,his hand  trembling with his effort at self control  bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale 
1886,daisy own voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive 
1887, are we just going to go   she objected 
1888, like this  are not we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first  
1889, everybody smoked all through lunch  
1890, oh  let us have fun   she begged him 
1891, it is too hot to fuss  
1892,he did not answer 
1893, have it your own way   she said 
1894, come on  jordan  
1895,they went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet 
1896,a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky 
1897,gatsby started to speak  changed his mind  but not before tom wheeled and faced him expectantly 
1898, have you got your stables here   asked gatsby with an effort 
1899, about a quarter of a mile down the road  
1900,a pause 
1901, i do not see the idea of going to town   broke out tom savagely 
1902, women get these notions in their heads  
1903, shall we take anything to drink   called daisy from an upper window 
1904, i  get some whiskey   answered tom 
1905,he went inside 
1906,gatsby turned to me rigidly 
1907, i cannot say anything in his house  old sport  
1908, she is got an indiscreet voice   i remarked 
1909, it is full of  
1910,i hesitated 
1911, her voice is full of money   he said suddenly 
1912,that was it 
1913,I would never understood before 
1914,it was full of money that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it  the jingle of it  the cymbals  song of it 
1915,      high in a white palace the king own daughter  the golden girl       
1916,tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel  followed by daisy and jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms 
1917, shall we all go in my car   suggested gatsby 
1918,he felt the hot  green leather of the seat 
1919, i ought to have left it in the shade  
1920, is it standard shift   demanded tom 
1921, yes  
1922, well  you take my coup and let me drive your car to town  
1923,the suggestion was distasteful to gatsby 
1924, i do not think there is much gas   he objected 
1925, plenty of gas   said tom boisterously 
1926,he looked at the gauge 
1927, and if it runs out i can stop at a drug store  you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays  
1928,a pause followed this apparently pointless remark 
1929,daisy looked at tom frowning and an indefinable expression  at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable  as if i had only heard it described in words  passed over gatsby own face 
1930, come on  daisy   said tom  pressing her with his hand toward gatsby own car 
1931, i  take you in this circus wagon  
1932,he opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm 
1933, you take nick and jordan  we  follow you in the coup   
1934,she walked close to gatsby  touching his coat with her hand 
1935,jordan and tom and i got into the front seat of gatsby own car  tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind 
1936, did you see that   demanded tom 
1937, see what  
1938,he looked at me keenly  realizing that jordan and i must have known all along 
1939, you think i  pretty dumb  do not you   he suggested 
1940, perhaps i am  but i have a almost a second sight  sometimes  that tells me what to do  maybe you do not believe that  but science  
1941,he paused 
1942,the immediate contingency overtook him  pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss 
1943, I have made a small investigation of this fellow   he continued 
1944, i could have gone deeper if I would known  
1945, do you mean you have been to a medium   inquired jordan humorously 
1946, what  
1947,confused  he stared at us as we laughed 
1948, a medium  
1949, about gatsby  
1950, about gatsby  no  i have not  i said I would been making a small investigation of his past  
1951, and you found he was an oxford man   said jordan helpfully 
1952, an oxford man  
1953,he was incredulous 
1954, like hell he is  he wears a pink suit  
1955, nevertheless he is an oxford man  
1956, oxford  new mexico   snorted tom contemptuously   or something like that  
1957, listen  tom  if you are such a snob  why did you invite him to lunch   demanded jordan crossly 
1958, daisy invited him  she knew him before we were married god knows where  
1959,we were all irritable now with the fading ale and  aware of it  we drove for a while in silence 
1960,then as doctor t  j  eckleburg own faded eyes came into sight down the road  i remembered gatsby own caution about gasoline 
1961, we have got enough to get us to town   said tom 
1962, but there is a garage right here   objected jordan 
1963, i do not want to get stalled in this baking heat  
1964,tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under wilson own sign 
1965,after a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow eyed at the car 
1966, let us have some gas   cried tom roughly 
1967, what do you think we stopped for to admire the view  
1968, i  sick   said wilson without moving 
1969, i been sick all day  
1970, what is the matter  
1971, i  all run down  
1972, well  shall i help myself  
1973,tom demanded 
1974, you sounded well enough on the phone  
1975,with an effort wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and  breathing hard  unscrewed the cap of the tank 
1976,in the sunlight his face was green 
1977, i did not mean to interrupt your lunch   he said 
1978, but i need money pretty bad and i was wondering what you were going to do with your old car  
1979, how do you like this one   inquired tom 
1980, i bought it last week  
1981, it is a nice yellow one   said wilson  as he strained at the handle 
1982, like to buy it  
1983, big chance   wilson smiled faintly 
1984, no  but i could make some money on the other  
1985, what do you want money for  all of a sudden  
1986, I have been here too long  i want to get away  my wife and i want to go west  
1987, your wife does   exclaimed tom  startled 
1988, she is been talking about it for ten years  
1989,he rested for a moment against the pump  shading his eyes 
1990, and now she is going whether she wants to or not  i  going to get her away  
1991,the coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand 
1992, what do i owe you   demanded tom harshly 
1993, i just got wised up to something funny the last two days   remarked wilson 
1994, that is why i want to get away  that is why i been bothering you about the car  
1995, what do i owe you  
1996, dollar twenty  
1997,the relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and i had a bad moment there before i realized that so far his suspicions had not alighted on tom 
1998,he had discovered that myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick 
1999,i stared at him and then at tom  who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men  in intelligence or race  so profound as the difference between the sick and the well 
2000,wilson was so sick that he looked guilty  unforgivably guilty as if he had just got some poor girl with child 
2001, i  let you have that car   said tom 
2002, i  send it over tomorrow afternoon  
2003,that locality was always vaguely disquieting  even in the broad glare of afternoon  and now i turned my head as though i had been warned of something behind 
2004,over the ashheaps the giant eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg kept their vigil but i perceived  after a moment  that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away 
2005,in one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car 
2006,so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture 
2007,her expression was curiously familiar it was an expression i had often seen on women own faces but on myrtle wilson own face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes  wide with jealous terror  were fixed not on tom  but on jordan baker  whom she took to be his wife 
2008,there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind  and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic 
2009,his wife and his mistress  until an hour ago secure and inviolate  were slipping precipitately from his control 
2010,instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking daisy and leaving wilson behind  and we sped along toward astoria at fifty miles an hour  until  among the spidery girders of the elevated  we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup  
2011, those big movies around fiftieth street are cool   suggested jordan 
2012, i love new york on summer afternoons when every one own away  there is something very sensuous about it overripe  as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands  
2013,the word  sensuous  had the effect of further disquieting tom but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and daisy signalled us to draw up alongside 
2014, where are we going   she cried 
2015, how about the movies  
2016, it is so hot   she complained 
2017, you go  we  ride around and meet you after  
2018,with an effort her wit rose faintly   we  meet you on some corner  i  be the man smoking two cigarettes  
2019, we cannot argue about it here   tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us 
2020, you follow me to the south side of central park  in front of the plaza  
2021,several times he turned his head and looked back for their car  and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight 
2022,i think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever 
2023,but they did not 
2024,and we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the plaza hotel 
2025,the prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me  though i have a sharp physical memory that  in the course of it  my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back 
2026,the notion originated with daisy own suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths  and then assumed more tangible form as  a place to have a mint julep  
2027,each of us said over and over that it was a  crazy idea  we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought  or pretended to think  that we were being very funny       
2028,the room was large and stifling  and  though it was already four of the clock  opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the park 
2029,daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us  fixing her hair 
2030, it is a swell suite   whispered jordan respectfully and every one laughed 
2031, open another window   commanded daisy  without turning around 
2032, there are not any more  
2033, well  we would better telephone for an axe  
2034, the thing to do is to forget about the heat   said tom impatiently 
2035, you make it ten times worse by crabbing about it  
2036,he unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table 
2037, why not let her alone  old sport   remarked gatsby 
2038, you are the one that wanted to come to town  
2039,there was a moment of silence 
2040,the telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor  whereupon jordan whispered  excuse me  but this time no one laughed 
2041, i  pick it up   i offered 
2042, I have got it  
2043,gatsby examined the parted string  muttered  hum   in an interested way  and tossed the book on a chair 
2044, that is a great expression of yours  is not it   said tom sharply 
2045, what is  
2046, all this  old sport  business  where did you pick that up  
2047, now see here  tom   said daisy  turning around from the mirror   if you are going to make personal remarks i will not stay here a minute  call up and order some ice for the mint julep  
2048,as tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of mendelssohn own wedding march from the ballroom below 
2049, imagine marrying anybody in this heat   cried jordan dismally 
2050, still i was married in the middle of june   daisy remembered   louisville in june  somebody fainted  who was it fainted  tom  
2051, biloxi   he answered shortly 
2052, a man named biloxi   blocks  biloxi  and he made boxes that is a fact and he was from biloxi  tennessee  
2053, they carried him into my house   appended jordan   because we lived just two doors from the church  and he stayed three weeks  until daddy told him he had to get out  the day after he left daddy died  
2054,after a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent   there was not any connection  
2055, i used to know a bill biloxi from memphis   i remarked 
2056, that was his cousin  i knew his whole family history before he left  he gave me an aluminum putter that i use today  
2057,the music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window  followed by intermittent cries of  yea ea ea   and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began 
2058, we are getting old   said daisy 
2059, if we were young we would rise and dance  
2060, remember biloxi   jordan warned her 
2061, where did you know him  tom  
2062, biloxi  
2063,he concentrated with an effort 
2064, i did not know him  he was a friend of daisy own  
2065, he was not   she denied 
2066, I would never seen him before  he came down in the private car  
2067, well  he said he knew you  he said he was raised in louisville  asa bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him  
2068,jordan smiled 
2069, he was probably bumming his way home  he told me he was president of your class at yale  
2070,tom and i looked at each other blankly 
2071, biloxi  
2072, first place  we did not have any president  
2073,gatsby own foot beat a short  restless tattoo and tom eyed him suddenly 
2074, by the way  mr  gatsby  i understand you are an oxford man  
2075, not exactly  
2076, oh  yes  i understand you went to oxford  
2077, yes i went there  
2078,a pause 
2079,then tom own voice  incredulous and insulting 
2080, you must have gone there about the time biloxi went to new haven  
2081,another pause 
2082,a waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his  thank you  and the soft closing of the door 
2083,this tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last 
2084, i told you i went there   said gatsby 
2085, i heard you  but I would like to know when  
2086, it was in nineteen nineteen  i only stayed five months  that is why i cannot really call myself an oxford man  
2087,tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief 
2088,but we were all looking at gatsby 
2089, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice   he continued 
2090, we could go to any of the universities in england or france  
2091,i wanted to get up and slap him on the back 
2092,i had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I would experienced before 
2093,daisy rose  smiling faintly  and went to the table 
2094, open the whiskey  tom   she ordered 
2095, and i  make you a mint julep  then you will not seem so stupid to yourself        look at the mint  
2096, wait a minute   snapped tom   i want to ask mr  gatsby one more question  
2097, go on   gatsby said politely 
2098, what kind of a row are you trying to because in my house anyhow  
2099,they were out in the open at last and gatsby was content 
2100, he is not causing a row  
2101,daisy looked desperately from one to the other 
2102, you are causing a row  please have a little self control  
2103, self control   repeated tom incredulously 
2104, i suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let mr  nobody from nowhere make love to your wife  well  if that is the idea you can count me out        nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they  throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white  
2105,flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization 
2106, we are all white here   murmured jordan 
2107, i know i  not very popular  i do not give big parties  i suppose you have got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends in the modern world  
2108,angry as i was  as we all were  i was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth 
2109,the transition from libertine to prig was so complete 
2110, I have got something to tell you  old sport    began gatsby 
2111,but daisy guessed at his intention 
2112, please do not   she interrupted helplessly 
2113, please let us all go home  why do not we all go home  
2114, that is a good idea  
2115,i got up 
2116, come on  tom  nobody wants a drink  
2117, i want to know what mr  gatsby has to tell me  
2118, your wife does not love you   said gatsby 
2119, she is never loved you  she loves me  
2120, you must be crazy   exclaimed tom automatically 
2121,gatsby sprang to his feet  vivid with excitement 
2122, she never loved you  do you hear   he cried 
2123, she only married you because i was poor and she was tired of waiting for me  it was a terrible mistake  but in her heart she never loved any one except me  
2124,at this point jordan and i tried to go but tom and gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions 
2125, sit down daisy  
2126,tom own voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note 
2127, what is been going on  i want to hear all about it  
2128, i told you what is been going on   said gatsby 
2129, going on for five years and you did not know  
2130,tom turned to daisy sharply 
2131, you have been seeing this fellow for five years  
2132, not seeing   said gatsby 
2133, no  we could not meet  but both of us loved each other all that time  old sport  and you did not know  i used to laugh sometimes  but there was no laughter in his eyes   to think that you did not know  
2134, oh that is all  
2135,tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair 
2136, you are crazy   he exploded 
2137, i cannot speak about what happened five years ago  because i did not know daisy then and i  be damned if i see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door  but all the rest of that is a god damned lie  daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now  
2138, no   said gatsby  shaking his head 
2139, she does  though  the trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and does not know what she is doing  
2140,he nodded sagely 
2141, and what is more  i love daisy too  once in a while i go off on a spree and make a fool of myself  but i always come back  and in my heart i love her all the time  
2142, you are revolting   said daisy 
2143,she turned to me  and her voice  dropping an octave lower  filled the room with thrilling scorn   do you know why we left chicago  i  surprised that they did not treat you to the story of that little spree  
2144,gatsby walked over and stood beside her 
2145, daisy  that is all over now   he said earnestly 
2146, it does not matter any more  just tell him the truth that you never loved him and it is all wiped out forever  
2147,she looked at him blindly 
2148, why  how could i love him possibly  
2149, you never loved him  
2150,she hesitated 
2151,her eyes fell on jordan and me with a sort of appeal  as though she realized at last what she was doing and as though she had never  all along  intended doing anything at all 
2152,but it was done now 
2153,it was too late 
2154, i never loved him   she said  with perceptible reluctance 
2155, not at kapiolani   demanded tom suddenly 
2156,from the ballroom beneath  muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air 
2157, not that day i carried you down from the punch bowl to keep your shoes dry  
2158,there was a husky tenderness in his tone 
2159,       daisy  
2160, please do not  
2161,her voice was cold  but the rancour was gone from it 
2162,she looked at gatsby 
2163, there  jay   she said but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling 
2164,suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet 
2165, oh  you want too much   she cried to gatsby 
2166, i love you now is not that enough  i cannot help what is past  
2167,she began to sob helplessly 
2168, i did love him once but i loved you too  
2169,gatsby own eyes opened and closed 
2170, you loved me too   he repeated 
2171, even that is a lie   said tom savagely 
2172, she did not know you were alive  why  there are things between daisy and me that you  never know  things that neither of us can ever forget  
2173,the words seemed to bite physically into gatsby 
2174, i want to speak to daisy alone   he insisted 
2175, she is all excited now  
2176, even alone i cannot say i never loved tom   she admitted in a pitiful voice 
2177, it would not be true  
2178, of course it would not   agreed tom 
2179,she turned to her husband 
2180, as if it mattered to you   she said 
2181, of course it matters  i  going to take better care of you from now on  
2182, you do not understand   said gatsby  with a touch of panic 
2183, you are not going to take care of her any more  
2184, i  not  
2185,tom opened his eyes wide and laughed 
2186,he could afford to control himself now 
2187, why is that  
2188, daisy own leaving you  
2189, nonsense  
2190, i am  though   she said with a visible effort 
2191, she is not leaving me  
2192,tom own words suddenly leaned down over gatsby 
2193, certainly not for a common swindler who would have to steal the ring he put on her finger  
2194, i will not stand this   cried daisy 
2195, oh  please let us get out  
2196, who are you  anyhow   broke out tom 
2197, you are one of that bunch that hangs around with meyer wolfshiem that much i happen to know  I have made a little investigation into your affairs and i  carry it further tomorrow  
2198, you can suit yourself about that  old sport   said gatsby steadily 
2199, i found out what your  drug stores  were  
2200,he turned to us and spoke rapidly 
2201, he and this wolfshiem bought up a lot of side street drug stores here and in chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter  that is one of his little stunts  i picked him for a bootlegger the first time i saw him and i was not far wrong  
2202, what about it   said gatsby politely 
2203, i guess your friend walter chase was not too proud to come in on it  
2204, and you left him in the lurch  did not you  you let him go to jail for a month over in new jersey  god  you ought to hear walter on the subject of you  
2205, he came to us dead broke  he was very glad to pick up some money  old sport  
2206, do not you call me  old sport    cried tom 
2207,gatsby said nothing 
2208, walter could have you up on the betting laws too  but wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth  
2209,that unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in gatsby own face 
2210, that drug store business was just small change   continued tom slowly   but you have got something on now that walter own afraid to tell me about  
2211,i glanced at daisy who was staring terrified between gatsby and her husband and at jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin 
2212,then i turned back to gatsby and was startled at his expression 
2213,he looked and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden as if he had  killed a man  
2214,for a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way 
2215,it passed  and he began to talk excitedly to daisy  denying everything  defending his name against accusations that had not been made 
2216,but with every word she was drawing further and further into herself  so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away  trying to touch what was no longer tangible  struggling unhappily  undespairingly  toward that lost voice across the room 
2217,the voice begged again to go 
2218, please  tom  i cannot stand this any more  
2219,her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions  whatever courage she had had  were definitely gone 
2220, you two start on home  daisy   said tom 
2221, in mr  gatsby own car  
2222,she looked at tom  alarmed now  but he insisted with magnanimous scorn 
2223, go on  he will not annoy you  i think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over  
2224,they were gone  without a word  snapped out  made accidental  isolated  like ghosts even from our pity 
2225,after a moment tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel 
2226, want any of this stuff  jordan        nick  
2227,i did not answer 
2228, nick  
2229,he asked again 
2230, what  
2231, want any  
2232, no       i just remembered that today own my birthday  
2233,i was thirty 
2234,before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade 
2235,it was seven of the clock when we got into the coup with him and started for long island 
2236,tom talked incessantly  exulting and laughing  but his voice was as remote from jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead 
2237,human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind 
2238,thirty the promise of a decade of loneliness  a thinning list of single men to know  a thinning brief case of enthusiasm  thinning hair 
2239,but there was jordan beside me who  unlike daisy  was too wise ever to carry well forgotten dreams from age to age 
2240,as we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat own shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand 
2241,so we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight 
2242,the young greek  michaelis  who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest 
2243,he had slept through the heat until after five  when he strolled over to the garage and found george wilson sick in his office really sick  pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over 
2244,michaelis advised him to go to bed but wilson refused  saying that he would miss a lot of business if he did 
2245,while his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead 
2246, I have got my wife locked in up there   explained wilson calmly 
2247, she is going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we are going to move away  
2248,michaelis was astonished  they had been neighbors for four years and wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement 
2249,generally he was one of these worn out men  when he was not working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road 
2250,when any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable  colorless way 
2251,he was his wife own man and not his own 
2252,so naturally michaelis tried to find out what had happened  but wilson would not say a word instead he began to throw curious  suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he would been doing at certain times on certain days 
2253,just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and michaelis took the opportunity to get away  intending to come back later 
2254,but he did not 
2255,he supposed he forgot to  that is all 
2256,when he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard mrs  wilson own voice  loud and scolding  downstairs in the garage 
2257, beat me   he heard her cry 
2258, throw me down and beat me  you dirty little coward  
2259,a moment later she rushed out into the dusk  waving her hands and shouting  before he could move from his door the business was over 
2260,the  death car  as the newspapers called it  did not stop  it came out of the gathering darkness  wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend 
2261,michaelis was not even sure of its color he told the first policeman that it was light green 
2262,the other car  the one going toward new york  came to rest a hundred yards beyond  and its driver hurried back to where myrtle wilson  her life violently extinguished  knelt in the road and mingled her thick  dark blood with the dust 
2263,michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration  they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath 
2264,the mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long 
2265,we saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away 
2266, wreck   said tom 
2267, that is good  wilson  have a little business at last  
2268,he slowed down  but still without any intention of stopping until  as we came nearer  the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes 
2269, we  take a look   he said doubtfully   just a look  
2270,i became aware now of a hollow  wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage  a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words  oh  my god   uttered over and over in a gasping moan 
2271, there is some bad trouble here   said tom excitedly 
2272,he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead 
2273,then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through 
2274,the circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation  it was a minute before i could see anything at all 
2275,then new arrivals disarranged the line and jordan and i were pushed suddenly inside 
2276,myrtle wilson own body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and tom  with his back to us  was bending over it  motionless 
2277,next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book 
2278,at first i could not find the source of the high  groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage then i saw wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office  swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands 
2279,some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder  but wilson neither heard nor saw 
2280,his eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call 
2281, o  my ga od  o  my ga od  oh  ga od  oh  my ga od  
2282,presently tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman 
2283, m a    the policeman was saying    o  
2284, no  are   corrected the man   m a  r o  
2285, listen to me   muttered tom fiercely 
2286, are   said the policeman   o  
2287,he looked up as tom own broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder 
2288, what you want  fella  
2289, what happened that is what i want to know  
2290, auto hit her  ins antly killed  
2291, instantly killed   repeated tom  staring 
2292, she ran out ina road  son of a bitch did not even stopus car  
2293, there was two cars   said michaelis   one comin   one going  see  
2294, going where   asked the policeman keenly 
2295, one going each way  well  she  
2296,his hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side    she ran out there an  the one comin  from n york knock right into her going thirty or forty miles an hour  
2297, what is the name of this place here   demanded the officer 
2298, has not got any name  
2299,a pale  well dressed negro stepped near 
2300, it was a yellow car   he said   big yellow car  new  
2301, see the accident   asked the policeman 
2302, no  but the car passed me down the road  going faster n forty  going fifty  sixty  
2303, come here and let us have your name  look out now  i want to get his name  
2304,some words of this conversation must have reached wilson swaying in the office door  for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries 
2305, you do not have to tell me what kind of car it was  i know what kind of car it was  
2306,watching tom i saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat 
2307,he walked quickly over to wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms 
2308, you have got to pull yourself together   he said with soothing gruffness 
2309,wilson own eyes fell upon tom  he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not tom held him upright 
2310, listen   said tom  shaking him a little 
2311, i just got here a minute ago  from new york  i was bringing you that coup we have been talking about  that yellow car i was driving this afternoon was not mine  do you hear  i have not seen it all afternoon  
2312,only the negro and i were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes 
2313, what is all that   he demanded 
2314, i  a friend of his  
2315,tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on wilson own body 
2316, he says he knows the car that did it        it was a yellow car  
2317,some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at tom 
2318, and what color own your car  
2319, it is a blue car  a coup   
2320, we have come straight from new york   i said 
2321,some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away 
2322, now  if you  let me have that name again correct  
2323,picking up wilson like a doll tom carried him into the office  set him down in a chair and came back 
2324, if somebody  come here and sit with him   he snapped authoritatively 
2325,he watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room 
2326,then tom shut the door on them and came down the single step  his eyes avoiding the table 
2327,as he passed close to me he whispered  let us get out  
2328,self consciously  with his authoritative arms breaking the way  we pushed through the still gathering crowd  passing a hurried doctor  case in hand  who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago 
2329,tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend then his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night 
2330,in a little while i heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face 
2331, the god damn coward   he whimpered 
2332, he did not even stop his car  
2333,the buchanans  house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees 
2334,tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines 
2335, daisy own home   he said 
2336,as we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly 
2337, i ought to have dropped you in west egg  nick  there is nothing we can do tonight  
2338,a change had come over him and he spoke gravely  and with decision 
2339,as we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases 
2340, i  telephone for a taxi to take you home  and while you are waiting you and jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper if you want any  
2341,he opened the door 
2342, come in  
2343, no thanks  but I would be glad if you would order me the taxi  i  wait outside  
2344,jordan put her hand on my arm 
2345, will not you come in  nick  
2346, no thanks  
2347,i was feeling a little sick and i wanted to be alone 
2348,but jordan lingered for a moment more 
2349, it is only half past nine   she said 
2350,I would be damned if I would go in  I would had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included jordan too 
2351,she must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house 
2352,i sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands  until i heard the phone taken up inside and the butler own voice calling a taxi 
2353,then i walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate 
2354,i had not gone twenty yards when i heard my name and gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path 
2355,i must have felt pretty weird by that time because i could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon 
2356, what are you doing  
2357,i inquired 
2358, just standing here  old sport  
2359,somehow  that seemed a despicable occupation 
2360,for all i knew he was going to rob the house in a moment  i would not have been surprised to see sinister faces  the faces of  wolfshiem own people   behind him in the dark shrubbery 
2361, did you see any trouble on the road   he asked after a minute 
2362, yes  
2363,he hesitated 
2364, was she killed  
2365, yes  
2366, i thought so  i told daisy i thought so  it is better that the shock should all come at once  she stood it pretty well  
2367,he spoke as if daisy own reaction was the only thing that mattered 
2368, i got to west egg by a side road   he went on   and left the car in my garage  i do not think anybody saw us but of course i cannot be sure  
2369,i disliked him so much by this time that i did not find it necessary to tell him he was wrong 
2370, who was the woman   he inquired 
2371, her name was wilson  her husband owns the garage  how the devil did it happen  
2372, well  i tried to swing the wheel  
2373,he broke off  and suddenly i guessed at the truth 
2374, was daisy driving  
2375, yes   he said after a moment   but of course i  say i was  you see  when we left new york she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way  it all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us  thought we were somebody she knew  well  first daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car  and then she lost her nerve and turned back  the second my hand reached the wheel i felt the shock it must have killed her instantly  
2376, it ripped her open  
2377, do not tell me  old sport  
2378,he winced 
2379, anyhow daisy stepped on it 
2380,i tried to make her stop  but she could not so i pulled on the emergency brake 
2381,then she fell over into my lap and i drove on 
2382, she  be all right tomorrow   he said presently 
2383, i  just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon  she is locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality she is going to turn the light out and on again  
2384, he will not touch her   i said 
2385, he is not thinking about her  
2386, i do not trust him  old sport  
2387, how long are you going to wait  
2388, all night if necessary  anyhow till they all go to bed  
2389,a new point of view occurred to me 
2390,suppose tom found out that daisy had been driving 
2391,he might think he saw a connection in it he might think anything 
2392,i looked at the house  there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from daisy own room on the second floor 
2393, you wait here   i said 
2394, i  see if there is any sign of a commotion  
2395,i walked back along the border of the lawn  traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps 
2396,the drawing room curtains were open  and i saw that the room was empty 
2397,crossing the porch where we had dined that june night three months before i came to a small rectangle of light which i guessed was the pantry window 
2398,the blind was drawn but i found a rift at the sill 
2399,daisy and tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale 
2400,he was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own 
2401,once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement 
2402,they were not happy  and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale and yet they were not unhappy either 
2403,there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together 
2404,as i tiptoed from the porch i heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house 
2405,gatsby was waiting where i had left him in the drive 
2406, is it all quiet up there   he asked anxiously 
2407, yes  it is all quiet  
2408,i hesitated 
2409, you would better come home and get some sleep  
2410,he shook his head 
2411, i want to wait here till daisy goes to bed  good night  old sport  
2412,he put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house  as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil 
2413,so i walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight watching over nothing 
2414,i could not sleep all night  a fog horn was groaning incessantly on the sound  and i tossed half sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams 
2415,toward dawn i heard a taxi go up gatsby own drive and immediately i jumped out of bed and began to dress i felt that i had something to tell him  something to warn him about and morning would be too late 
2416,crossing his lawn i saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall  heavy with dejection or sleep 
2417, nothing happened   he said wanly 
2418, i waited  and about four of the clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light  
2419,his house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes 
2420,we pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches once i tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano 
2421,there was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they had not been aired for many days 
2422,i found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside 
2423,throwing open the french windows of the drawing room we sat smoking out into the darkness 
2424, you ought to go away   i said 
2425, it is pretty certain they  trace your car  
2426, go away now  old sport  
2427, go to atlantic city for a week  or up to montreal  
2428,he would not consider it 
2429,he could not possibly leave daisy until he knew what she was going to do 
2430,he was clutching at some last hope and i could not bear to shake him free 
2431,it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with dan cody told it to me because  jay gatsby  had broken up like glass against tom own hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out 
2432,i think that he would have acknowledged anything  now  without reserve  but he wanted to talk about daisy 
2433,she was the first  nice  girl he had ever known 
2434,in various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between 
2435,he found her excitingly desirable 
2436,he went to her house  at first with other officers from camp taylor  then alone 
2437,it amazed him he had never been in such a beautiful house before 
2438,but what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that daisy lived there it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him 
2439,there was a ripe mystery about it  a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms  of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year own shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered 
2440,it excited him too that many men had already loved daisy it increased her value in his eyes 
2441,he felt their presence all about the house  pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions 
2442,but he knew that he was in daisy own house by a colossal accident 
2443,however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby  he was at present a penniless young man without a past  and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders 
2444,so he made the most of his time 
2445,he took what he could get  ravenously and unscrupulously eventually he took daisy one still october night  took her because he had no real right to touch her hand 
2446,he might have despised himself  for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses 
2447,i do not mean that he had traded on his phantom millions  but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security  he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself that he was fully able to take care of her 
2448,as a matter of fact he had no such facilities he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world 
2449,but he did not despise himself and it did not turn out as he had imagined 
2450,he had intended  probably  to take what he could and go but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail 
2451,he knew that daisy was extraordinary but he did not realize just how extraordinary a  nice  girl could be 
2452,she vanished into her rich house  into her rich  full life  leaving gatsby nothing 
2453,he felt married to her  that was all 
2454,when they met again two days later it was gatsby who was breathless  who was somehow betrayed 
2455,her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star shine  the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth 
2456,she had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves  of the freshness of many clothes and of daisy  gleaming like silver  safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor 
2457, i cannot describe to you how surprised i was to find out i loved her  old sport  i even hoped for a while that she would throw me over  but she did not  because she was in love with me too  she thought i knew a lot because i knew different things from her        well  there i was  way off my ambitions  getting deeper in love every minute  and all of a sudden i did not care  what was the use of doing great things if i could have a better time telling her what i was going to do  
2458,on the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with daisy in his arms for a long  silent time 
2459,it was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed 
2460,now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair 
2461,the afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised 
2462,they had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat own shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers  gently  as though she were asleep 
2463,he did extraordinarily well in the war 
2464,he was a captain before he went to the front and following the argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns 
2465,after the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to oxford instead 
2466,he was worried now there was a quality of nervous despair in daisy own letters 
2467,she did not see why he could not come 
2468,she was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all 
2469,for daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant  cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year  summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes 
2470,all night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the  beale street blues  while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust 
2471,at the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever  while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor 
2472,through this twilight universe daisy began to move again with the season  suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed 
2473,and all the time something within her was crying for a decision 
2474,she wanted her life shaped now  immediately and the decision must be made by some force of love  of money  of unquestionable practicality that was close at hand 
2475,that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom buchanan 
2476,there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and daisy was flattered 
2477,doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief 
2478,the letter reached gatsby while he was still at oxford 
2479,it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs  filling the house with grey turning  gold turning light 
2480,the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves 
2481,there was a slow pleasant movement in the air  scarcely a wind  promising a cool lovely day 
2482, i do not think she ever loved him  
2483,gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly 
2484, you must remember  old sport  she was very excited this afternoon  he told her those things in a way that frightened her that made it look as if i was some kind of cheap sharper  and the result was she hardly knew what she was saying  
2485,he sat down gloomily 
2486, of course she might have loved him  just for a minute  when they were first married and loved me more even then  do you see  
2487,suddenly he came out with a curious remark 
2488, in any case   he said   it was just personal  
2489,what could you make of that  except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that could not be measured 
2490,he came back from france when tom and daisy were still on their wedding trip  and made a miserable but irresistible journey to louisville on the last of his army pay 
2491,he stayed there a week  walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the november night and revisiting the out of the way places to which they had driven in her white car 
2492,just as daisy own house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself  even though she was gone from it  was pervaded with a melancholy beauty 
2493,he left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found her that he was leaving her behind 
2494,the day coach he was penniless now was hot 
2495,he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding chair  and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by 
2496,then out into the spring fields  where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street 
2497,the track curved and now it was going away from the sun which  as it sank lower  seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath 
2498,he stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air  to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him 
2499,but it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it  the freshest and the best  forever 
2500,it was nine of the clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch 
2501,the night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air 
2502,the gardener  the last one of gatsby own former servants  came to the foot of the steps 
2503, i  going to drain the pool today  mr  gatsby  leaves  start falling pretty soon and then there is always trouble with the pipes  
2504, do not do it today   gatsby answered 
2505,he turned to me apologetically 
2506, you know  old sport  I have never used that pool all summer  
2507,i looked at my watch and stood up 
2508, twelve minutes to my train  
2509,i did not want to go to the city 
2510,i was not worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that i did not want to leave gatsby 
2511,i missed that train  and then another  before i could get myself away 
2512, i  call you up   i said finally 
2513, do  old sport  
2514, i  call you about noon  
2515,we walked slowly down the steps 
2516, i suppose daisy  call too  
2517,he looked at me anxiously as if he hoped I would corroborate this 
2518, i suppose so  
2519, well goodbye  
2520,we shook hands and i started away 
2521,just before i reached the hedge i remembered something and turned around 
2522, they are a rotten crowd   i shouted across the lawn 
2523, you are worth the whole damn bunch put together  
2524,I have always been glad i said that 
2525,it was the only compliment i ever gave him  because i disapproved of him from beginning to end 
2526,first he nodded politely  and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile  as if we would been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time 
2527,his gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and i thought of the night when i first came to his ancestral home three months before 
2528,the lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption and he had stood on those steps  concealing his incorruptible dream  as he waved them goodbye 
2529,i thanked him for his hospitality 
2530,we were always thanking him for that i and the others 
2531, goodbye   i called 
2532, i enjoyed breakfast  gatsby  
2533,up in the city i tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock  then i fell asleep in my swivel chair 
2534,just before noon the phone woke me and i started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead 
2535,it was jordan baker  she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way 
2536,usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry 
2537, I have left daisy own house   she said 
2538, i  at hempstead and i  going down to southampton this afternoon  
2539,probably it had been tactful to leave daisy own house  but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid 
2540, you were not so nice to me last night  
2541, how could it have mattered then  
2542,silence for a moment 
2543,then
2544, however i want to see you  
2545, i want to see you too  
2546, suppose i do not go to southampton  and come into town this afternoon  
2547, no i do not think this afternoon  
2548, very well  
2549, it is impossible this afternoon  various  
2550,we talked like that for a while and then abruptly we were not talking any longer 
2551,i do not know which of us hung up with a sharp click but i know i did not care 
2552,i could not have talked to her across a tea table that day if i never talked to her again in this world 
2553,i called gatsby own house a few minutes later  but the line was busy 
2554,i tried four times  finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from detroit 
2555,taking out my time table i drew a small circle around the three fifty train 
2556,then i leaned back in my chair and tried to think 
2557,it was just noon 
2558,when i passed the ashheaps on the train that morning i had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car 
2559,i suppose there would be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and myrtle wilson own tragic achievement was forgotten 
2560,now i want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before 
2561,they had difficulty in locating the sister  catherine 
2562,she must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to flushing 
2563,when they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair 
2564,someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister own body 
2565,until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while george wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside 
2566,for a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it 
2567,finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door 
2568,michaelis and several other men were with him first four or five men  later two or three men 
2569,still later michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee 
2570,after that he stayed there alone with wilson until dawn 
2571,about three of the clock the quality of wilson own incoherent muttering changed he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car 
2572,he announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to  and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen 
2573,but when he heard himself say this  he flinched and began to cry  oh  my god   again in his groaning voice 
2574,michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him 
2575, how long have you been married  george  come on there  try and sit still a minute and answer my question  how long have you been married  
2576, twelve years  
2577, ever had any children  come on  george  sit still i asked you a question  did you ever have any children  
2578,the hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that had not stopped a few hours before 
2579,he did not like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office he knew every object in it before morning and from time to time sat down beside wilson trying to keep him more quiet 
2580, have you got a church you go to sometimes  george  maybe even if you have not been there for a long time  maybe i could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you  see  
2581, do not belong to any  
2582, you ought to have a church  george  for times like this  you must have gone to church once  did not you get married in a church  listen  george  listen to me  did not you get married in a church  
2583, that was a long time ago  
2584,the effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking for a moment he was silent 
2585,then the same half knowing  half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes 
2586, look in the drawer there   he said  pointing at the desk 
2587, which drawer  
2588, that drawer that one  
2589,michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand 
2590,there was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver 
2591,it was apparently new 
2592, this   he inquired  holding it up 
2593,wilson stared and nodded 
2594, i found it yesterday afternoon  she tried to tell me about it but i knew it was something funny  
2595, you mean your wife bought it  
2596, she had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau  
2597,michaelis did not see anything odd in that and he gave wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash 
2598,but conceivably wilson had heard some of these same explanations before  from myrtle  because he began saying  oh  my god   again in a whisper his comforter left several explanations in the air 
2599, then he killed her   said wilson 
2600,his mouth dropped open suddenly 
2601, who did  
2602, i have a way of finding out  
2603, you are morbid  george   said his friend 
2604, this has been a strain to you and you do not know what you are saying  you would better try and sit quiet till morning  
2605, he murdered her  
2606, it was an accident  george  
2607,wilson shook his head 
2608,his eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior  hm  
2609, i know   he said definitely   i  one of these trusting fellas and i do not think any harm to nobody  but when i get to know a thing i know it  it was the man in that car  she ran out to speak to him and he would not stop  
2610,michaelis had seen this too but it had not occurred to him that there was any special significance in it 
2611,he believed that mrs  wilson had been running away from her husband  rather than trying to stop any particular car 
2612, how could she of been like that  
2613, she is a deep one   said wilson  as if that answered the question 
2614, ah h h  
2615,he began to rock again and michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand 
2616, maybe you got some friend that i could telephone for  george  
2617,this was a forlorn hope he was almost sure that wilson had no friend  there was not enough of him for his wife 
2618,he was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room  a blue quickening by the window  and realized that dawn was not far off 
2619,about five of the clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light 
2620,wilson own glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps  where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind 
2621, i spoke to her   he muttered  after a long silence 
2622, i told her she might fool me but she could not fool god  i took her to the window  
2623,with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it    and i said  god knows what you have been doing  everything you have been doing  you may fool me but you cannot fool god    
2624,standing behind him michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of doctor t  j  eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night 
2625, god sees everything   repeated wilson 
2626, that is an advertisement   michaelis assured him 
2627,something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room 
2628,but wilson stood there a long time  his face close to the window pane  nodding into the twilight 
2629,by six of the clock michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside 
2630,it was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together 
2631,wilson was quieter now and michaelis went home to sleep  when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage wilson was gone 
2632,his movements he was on foot all the time were afterward traced to port roosevelt and then to gad own hill where he bought a sandwich that he did not eat and a cup of coffee 
2633,he must have been tired and walking slowly for he did not reach gad own hill until noon 
2634,thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time there were boys who had seen a man  acting sort of crazy  and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road 
2635,then for three hours he disappeared from view 
2636,the police  on the strength of what he said to michaelis  that he  had a way of finding out   supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car 
2637,on the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier  surer way of finding out what he wanted to know 
2638,by half past two he was in west egg where he asked someone the way to gatsby own house 
2639,so by that time he knew gatsby own name 
2640,at two of the clock gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool 
2641,he stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer  and the chauffeur helped him pump it up 
2642,then he gave instructions that the open car was not to be taken out under any circumstances and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair 
2643,gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool 
2644,once he stopped and shifted it a little  and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help  but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees 
2645,no telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four of the clock until long after there was any one to give it to if it came 
2646,i have an idea that gatsby himself did not believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared 
2647,if that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world  paid a high price for living too long with a single dream 
2648,he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass 
2649,a new world  material without being real  where poor ghosts  breathing dreams like air  drifted fortuitously about       like that ashen  fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees 
2650,the chauffeur he was one of wolfshiem own prot g s heard the shots afterward he could only say that he had not thought anything much about them 
2651,i drove from the station directly to gatsby own house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one 
2652,but they knew then  i firmly believe 
2653,with scarcely a word said  four of us  the chauffeur  butler  gardener and i  hurried down to the pool 
2654,there was a faint  barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other 
2655,with little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves  the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool 
2656,a small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden 
2657,the touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly  tracing  like the leg of compass  a thin red circle in the water 
2658,it was after we started with gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw wilson own body a little way off in the grass  and the holocaust was complete 
2659,after two years i remember the rest of that day  and that night and the next day  only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of gatsby own front door 
2660,a rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious  but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open mouthed about the pool 
2661,someone with a positive manner  perhaps a detective  used the expression  mad man  as he bent over wilson own body that afternoon  and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning 
2662,most of those reports were a nightmare grotesque  circumstantial  eager and untrue 
2663,when michaelis own testimony at the inquest brought to light wilson own suspicions of his wife i thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade but catherine  who might have said anything  did not say a word 
2664,she showed a surprising amount of character about it too looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen gatsby  that her sister was completely happy with her husband  that her sister had been into no mischief whatever 
2665,she convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure 
2666,so wilson was reduced to a man  deranged by grief  in order that the case might remain in its simplest form 
2667,and it rested there 
2668,but all this part of it seemed remote and unessential 
2669,i found myself on gatsby own side  and alone 
2670,from the moment i telephoned news of the catastrophe to west egg village  every surmise about him  and every practical question  was referred to me 
2671,at first i was surprised and confused  then  as he lay in his house and did not move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that i was responsible  because no one else was interested interested  i mean  with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end 
2672,i called up daisy half an hour after we found him  called her instinctively and without hesitation 
2673,but she and tom had gone away early that afternoon  and taken baggage with them 
2674, left no address  
2675, say when they would be back  
2676, any idea where they are  how i could reach them  
2677, i do not know  cannot say  
2678,i wanted to get somebody for him 
2679,i wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him   i  get somebody for you  gatsby  do not worry  just trust me and i  get somebody for you  
2680,meyer wolfshiem own name was not in the phone book 
2681,the butler gave me his office address on broadway and i called information  but by the time i had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone 
2682, will you ring again  
2683, I have rung them three times  
2684, it is very important  
2685, sorry  i  afraid no one own there  
2686,i went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors  all these official people who suddenly filled it 
2687,but as they drew back the sheet and looked at gatsby with unmoved eyes  his protest continued in my brain 
2688, look here  old sport  you have got to get somebody for me  you have got to try hard  i cannot go through this alone  
2689,some one started to ask me questions but i broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk he would never told me definitely that his parents were dead 
2690,but there was nothing only the picture of dan cody  a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall 
2691,next morning i sent the butler to new york with a letter to wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train 
2692,that request seemed superfluous when i wrote it 
2693,i was sure he would start when he saw the newspapers  just as i was sure there would be a wire from daisy before noon but neither a wire nor mr  wolfshiem arrived  no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men 
2694,when the butler brought back wolfshiem own answer i began to have a feeling of defiance  of scornful solidarity between gatsby and me against them all 
2695,dear mr  carraway 
2696,this has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me i hardly can believe it that it is true at all 
2697,such a mad act as that man did should make us all think 
2698,i cannot come down now as i am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now 
2699,if there is anything i can do a little later let me know in a letter by edgar 
2700,i hardly know where i am when i hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out 
2701,yours truly
2702,meyer wolfshiem
2703,and then hasty addenda beneath 
2704,let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all 
2705,when the phone rang that afternoon and long distance said chicago was calling i thought this would be daisy at last 
2706,but the connection came through as a man own voice  very thin and far away 
2707, this is slagle speaking        
2708, yes  
2709,the name was unfamiliar 
2710, hell of a note  is not it  get my wire  
2711, there have not been any wires  
2712, young parke own in trouble   he said rapidly 
2713, they picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter  they got a circular from new york giving  them the numbers just five minutes before  what d you know about that  hey  you never can tell in these hick towns  
2714, hello  
2715,i interrupted breathlessly 
2716, look here this is not mr  gatsby  mr  gatsby own dead  
2717,there was a long silence on the other end of the wire  followed by an exclamation       then a quick squawk as the connection was broken 
2718,i think it was on the third day that a telegram signed henry c  gatz arrived from a town in minnesota 
2719,it said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came 
2720,it was gatsby own father  a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed  bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm september day 
2721,his eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when i took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that i had difficulty in getting off his coat 
2722,he was on the point of collapse so i took him into the music room and made him sit down while i sent for something to eat 
2723,but he would not eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand 
2724, i saw it in the chicago newspaper   he said 
2725, it was all in the chicago newspaper  i started right away  
2726, i did not know how to reach you  
2727,his eyes  seeing nothing  moved ceaselessly about the room 
2728, it was a mad man   he said 
2729, he must have been mad  
2730, would not you like some coffee  
2731,i urged him 
2732, i do not want anything  i  all right now  mr   
2733, carraway  
2734, well  i  all right now  where have they got jimmy  
2735,i took him into the drawing room  where his son lay  and left him there 
2736,some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall  when i told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away 
2737,after a little while mr  gatz opened the door and came out  his mouth ajar  his face flushed slightly  his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears 
2738,he had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise  and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride 
2739,i helped him to a bedroom upstairs  while he took off his coat and vest i told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came 
2740, i did not know what you would want  mr  gatsby  
2741, gatz is my name  
2742,  mr  gatz  i thought you might want to take the body west  
2743,he shook his head 
2744, jimmy always liked it better down east  he rose up to his position in the east  were you a friend of my boy own  mr    
2745, we were close friends  
2746, he had a big future before him  you know  he was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here  
2747,he touched his head impressively and i nodded 
2748, if he would of lived he would of been a great man  a man like james j  hill  he would of helped build up the country  
2749, that is true   i said  uncomfortably 
2750,he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet  trying to take it from the bed  and lay down stiffly was instantly asleep 
2751,that night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who i was before he would give his name 
2752, this is mr  carraway   i said 
2753,he sounded relieved 
2754, this is klipspringer  
2755,i was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at gatsby own grave 
2756,i did not want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so I would been calling up a few people myself 
2757,they were hard to find 
2758, the funeral own tomorrow   i said 
2759, three of the clock  here at the house  i wish you would tell anybody who would be interested  
2760, oh  i will   he broke out hastily 
2761, of course i  not likely to see anybody  but if i do  
2762,his tone made me suspicious 
2763, of course you  be there yourself  
2764, well  i  certainly try  what i called up about is  
2765, wait a minute   i interrupted 
2766, how about saying you  come  
2767, well  the fact is the truth of the matter is that i  staying with some people up here in greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow  in fact there is a sort of picnic or something  of course i  do my very best to get away  
2768,i ejaculated an unrestrained  huh   and he must have heard me for he went on nervously 
2769, what i called up about was a pair of shoes i left there  i wonder if it would be too much trouble to have the butler send them on  you see they are tennis shoes and i  sort of helpless without them  my address is care of b  f   
2770,i did not hear the rest of the name because i hung up the receiver 
2771,after that i felt a certain shame for gatsby one gentleman to whom i telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved 
2772,however  that was my fault  for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at gatsby on the courage of gatsby own liquor and i should have known better than to call him 
2773,the morning of the funeral i went up to new york to see meyer wolfshiem  i could not seem to reach him any other way 
2774,the door that i pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked  the swastika holding company  and at first there did not seem to be any one inside 
2775,but when I would shouted  hello  several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes 
2776, nobody own in   she said 
2777, mr  wolfshiem own gone to chicago  
2778,the first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle  the rosary   tunelessly  inside 
2779, please say that mr  carraway wants to see him  
2780, i cannot get him back from chicago  can i  
2781,at this moment a voice  unmistakably wolfshiem own called  stella   from the other side of the door 
2782, leave your name on the desk   she said quickly 
2783, i  give it to him when he gets back  
2784, but i know he is there  
2785,she took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips 
2786, you young men think you can force your way in here any time   she scolded 
2787, we are getting sickantired of it  when i say he is in chicago  he is in chicago  
2788,i mentioned gatsby 
2789, oh h  
2790,she looked at me over again 
2791, will you just what was your name  
2792,she vanished 
2793,in a moment meyer wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway  holding out both hands 
2794,he drew me into his office  remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us  and offered me a cigar 
2795, my memory goes back to when i first met him   he said 
2796, a young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war  he was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he could not buy some regular clothes  first time i saw him was when he come into winebrenner own poolroom at forty third street and asked for a job  he had not eat anything for a couple of days   come on have some lunch with me   i sid  he ate more than four dollars  worth of food in half an hour  
2797, did you start him in business  
2798,i inquired 
2799, start him  i made him  
2800, i raised him up out of nothing  right out of the gutter  i saw right away he was a fine appearing  gentlemanly young man  and when he told me he was an oggsford i knew i could use him good  i got him to join up in the american legion and he used to stand high there  right off he did some work for a client of mine up to albany  we were so thick like that in everything  
2801,he held up two bulbous fingers   always together  
2802,i wondered if this partnership had included the world own series transaction in  
2803, now he is dead   i said after a moment 
2804, you were his closest friend  so i know you  want to come to his funeral this afternoon  
2805, I would like to come  
2806, well  come then  
2807,the hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears 
2808, i cannot do it i cannot get mixed up in it   he said 
2809, there is nothing to get mixed up in  it is all over now  
2810, when a man gets killed i never like to get mixed up in it in any way  i keep out  when i was a young man it was different if a friend of mine died  no matter how  i stuck with them to the end  you may think that is sentimental but i mean it to the bitter end  
2811,i saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come  so i stood up 
2812, are you a college man   he inquired suddenly 
2813,for a moment i thought he was going to suggest a  gonnegtion  but he only nodded and shook my hand 
2814, let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead   he suggested 
2815, after that my own rule is to let everything alone  
2816,when i left his office the sky had turned dark and i got back to west egg in a drizzle 
2817,after changing my clothes i went next door and found mr  gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall 
2818,his pride in his son and in his son own possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me 
2819, jimmy sent me this picture  
2820,he took out his wallet with trembling fingers 
2821, look there  
2822,it was a photograph of the house  cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands 
2823,he pointed out every detail to me eagerly 
2824, look there   and then sought admiration from my eyes 
2825,he had shown it so often that i think it was more real to him now than the house itself 
2826, jimmy sent it to me  i think it is a very pretty picture  it shows up well  
2827, very well  had you seen him lately  
2828, he come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house i live in now  of course we was broke up when he run off from home but i see now there was a reason for it  he knew he had a big future in front of him  and ever since he made a success he was very generous with me  
2829,he seemed reluctant to put away the picture  held it for another minute  lingeringly  before my eyes 
2830,then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called  hopalong cassidy  
2831, look here  this is a book he had when he was a boy  it just shows you  
2832,he opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see 
2833,on the last fly leaf was printed the word schedule  and the date september th   
2834,and underneath 
2835,rise from bed        
2836,dumbbell exercise and wall scaling        
2837,  study electricity  etc                                
2838,work        
2839,baseball and sports        
2840,  practice elocution  poise and how to attain it        
2841,study needed inventions        
2842,general resolves
2843,no wasting time at shafters or   no more smokeing or chewing bath every other day read one improving book or magazine per week save    
2844,per week be better to parents
2845, i come across this book by accident   said the old man 
2846, it just shows you  do not it  
2847, it just shows you  
2848, jimmy was bound to get ahead  he always had some resolves like this or something  do you notice what he is got about improving his mind  he was always great for that  he told me i et like a hog once and i beat him for it  
2849,he was reluctant to close the book  reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me  i think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use 
2850,a little before three the lutheran minister arrived from flushing and i began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars 
2851,so did gatsby own father 
2852,and as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall  his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way 
2853,the minister glanced several times at his watch so i took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour 
2854,but it was not any use 
2855,nobody came 
2856,about five of the clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate first a motor hearse  horribly black and wet  then mr  gatz and the minister and i in the limousine  and  a little later  four or five servants and the postman from west egg in gatsby own station wagon  all wet to the skin 
2857,as we started through the gate into the cemetery i heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground 
2858,i looked around 
2859,it was the man with owl eyed glasses whom i had found marvelling over gatsby own books in the library one night three months before 
2860,I would never seen him since then 
2861,i do not know how he knew about the funeral or even his name 
2862,the rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from gatsby own grave 
2863,i tried to think about gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and i could only remember  without resentment  that daisy had not sent a message or a flower 
2864,dimly i heard someone murmur  blessed are the dead that the rain falls on   and then the owl eyed man said  amen to that   in a brave voice 
2865,we straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars 
2866,owl eyes spoke to me by the gate 
2867, i could not get to the house   he remarked 
2868, neither could anybody else  
2869, go on  
2870,he started 
2871, why  my god  they used to go there by the hundreds  
2872,he took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in 
2873, the poor son of a bitch   he said 
2874,one of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at christmas time 
2875,those who went farther than chicago would gather in the old dim union station at six of the clock of a december evening with a few chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye 
2876,i remember the fur coats of the girls returning from miss this or that is and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations   are you going to the ordways   the herseys   the schultzes    and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands 
2877,and last the murky yellow cars of the chicago milwaukee and st  paul railroad looking cheerful as christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate 
2878,when we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow  our snow  began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows  and the dim lights of small wisconsin stations moved by  a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air 
2879,we drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules  unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again 
2880,that is my middle west not the wheat or the prairies or the lost swede towns but the thrilling  returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow 
2881,i am part of that  a little solemn with the feel of those long winters  a little complacent from growing up in the carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family own name 
2882,i see now that this has been a story of the west  after all tom and gatsby  daisy and jordan and i  were all westerners  and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to eastern life 
2883,even when the east excited me most  even when i was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored  sprawling  swollen towns beyond the ohio  with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old even then it had always for me a quality of distortion 
2884,west egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams 
2885,i see it as a night scene by el greco  a hundred houses  at once conventional and grotesque  crouching under a sullen  overhanging sky and a lustreless moon 
2886,in the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress 
2887,her hand  which dangles over the side  sparkles cold with jewels 
2888,gravely the men turn in at a house the wrong house 
2889,but no one knows the woman own name  and no one cares 
2890,after gatsby own death the east was haunted for me like that  distorted beyond my eyes  power of correction 
2891,so when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line i decided to come back home 
2892,there was one thing to be done before i left  an awkward  unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone 
2893,but i wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away 
2894,i saw jordan baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me  and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair 
2895,she was dressed to play golf and i remember thinking she looked like a good illustration  her chin raised a little  jauntily  her hair the color of an autumn leaf  her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee 
2896,when i had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man  i doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but i pretended to be surprised 
2897,for just a minute i wondered if i was not making a mistake  then i thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye 
2898, nevertheless you did throw me over   said jordan suddenly 
2899, you threw me over on the telephone  i do not give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and i felt a little dizzy for a while  
2900,we shook hands 
2901, oh  and do you remember   she added    a conversation we had once about driving a car  
2902, why not exactly  
2903, you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver  well  i met another bad driver  did not i  i mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess  i thought you were rather an honest  straightforward person  i thought it was your secret pride  
2904, i  thirty   i said 
2905, i  five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor  
2906,she did not answer 
2907,angry  and half in love with her  and tremendously sorry  i turned away 
2908,one afternoon late in october i saw tom buchanan 
2909,he was walking ahead of me along fifth avenue in his alert  aggressive way  his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference  his head moving sharply here and there  adapting itself to his restless eyes 
2910,just as i slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store 
2911,suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand 
2912, what is the matter  nick  do you object to shaking hands with me  
2913, yes  you know what i think of you  
2914, you are crazy  nick   he said quickly 
2915, crazy as hell  i do not know what is the matter with you  
2916, tom   i inquired   what did you say to wilson that afternoon  
2917,he stared at me without a word and i knew i had guessed right about those missing hours 
2918,i started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm 
2919, i told him the truth   he said 
2920, he came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when i sent down word that we were not in he tried to force his way upstairs  he was crazy enough to kill me if i had not told him who owned the car  his hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house  
2921,he broke off defiantly 
2922, what if i did tell him  that fellow had it coming to him  he threw dust into your eyes just like he did in daisy own but he was a tough one  he ran over myrtle like you would run over a dog and never even stopped his car  
2923,there was nothing i could say  except the one unutterable fact that it was not true 
2924, and if you think i did not have my share of suffering look here  when i went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard i sat down and cried like a baby  by god it was awful  
2925,i could not forgive him or like him but i saw that what he had done was  to him  entirely justified 
2926,it was all very careless and confused 
2927,they were careless people  tom and daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together  and let other people clean up the mess they had made       
2928,i shook hands with him  it seemed silly not to  for i felt suddenly as though i were talking to a child 
2929,then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons rid of my provincial squeamishness forever 
2930,gatsby own house was still empty when i left the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine 
2931,one of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside  perhaps it was he who drove daisy and gatsby over to east egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own 
2932,i did not want to hear it and i avoided him when i got off the train 
2933,i spent my saturday nights in new york because those gleaming  dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that i could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive 
2934,one night i did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps 
2935,but i did not investigate 
2936,probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and did not know that the party was over 
2937,on the last night  with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer  i went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more 
2938,on the white steps an obscene word  scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick  stood out clearly in the moonlight and i erased it  drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone 
2939,then i wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand 
2940,most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy  moving glow of a ferryboat across the sound 
2941,and as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that flowered once for dutch sailors  eyes a fresh  green breast of the new world 
2942,its vanished trees  the trees that had made way for gatsby own house  had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams  for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent  compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired  face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder 
2943,and as i sat there brooding on the old  unknown world  i thought of gatsby own wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of daisy own dock 
2944,he had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it 
2945,he did not know that it was already behind him  somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city  where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night 
2946,gatsby believed in the green light  the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us 
2947,it eluded us then  but that is no matter tomorrow we will run faster  stretch out our arms farther 
2948,      and one fine morning
2949,so we beat on  boats against the current  borne back ceaselessly into the past
