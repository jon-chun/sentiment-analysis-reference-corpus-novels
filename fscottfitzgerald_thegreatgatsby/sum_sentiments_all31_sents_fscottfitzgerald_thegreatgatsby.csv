1,1,THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,2,In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,3,"""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,4,"He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,5,"In consequence I' inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,6,"The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,7,"Most of the confidences were unsought frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,8,Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,9,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,10,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,11,Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,12,When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,14,"If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,15,"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament"" it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,16,"No Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,17,"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,18,"The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,19,I never saw this great-uncle but I' supposed to look like him with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,20,"I graduated from New Haven in , just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,21,I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,22,Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe so I decided to go east and learn the bond business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,23,Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,24,"All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ""Why ye-es"" with very grave, hesitant faces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,25,"Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,26,"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,27,"He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,28,"I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,29,"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,30,"""How do you get to West Egg village?"" he asked helplessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,31,I told him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,32,And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,33,"I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,34,He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,35,And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,36,There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,37,"I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,38,And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,"I was rather literary in college one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ""Yale News"" and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ""well-rounded man.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,40,"This isn't just an epigram life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,41,It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,42,"It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,43,"Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,44,They are not perfect ovals like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,45,To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,46,"I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,47,"My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,48,"The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard it was a factual imitation of some H tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,49,It was Gatsby's mansion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,50,"Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,51,"My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,52,"Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,53,Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,54,And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,55,"Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,56,His family were enormously wealthy even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,57,It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,58,Why they came east I don't know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,59,"They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,60,"This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it I had no sight into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,61,And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,62,"Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,63,"The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,64,"The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,65,He had changed since his New Haven years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,66,"Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,67,"Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,68,Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,69,It was a body capable of enormous leverage a cruel body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,70,"His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,71,"There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,72,"""Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,"" he seemed to say, ""just because I' stronger and more of a man than you are.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,73,"We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,74,We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,75,"""I've got a nice place here,"" he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,76,"Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,77,"""It belonged to Demaine the oil man.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,78,"He turned me around again, politely and abruptly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,79,"""We' go inside.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,80,"We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,81,The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,82,"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,83,The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,84,They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,85,I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,86,Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,87,The younger of the two was a stranger to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,88,"She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,89,"If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,90,"The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,91,"""I' p-paralyzed with happiness.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,92,"She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,93,That was a way she had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,94,She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,95,(I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,96,"At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,97,Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,98,Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,99,"I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,100,It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,101,"Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ""Listen,"" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,102,I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,103,"""Do they miss me?"" she cried ecstatically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,"""The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,105,"""How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,106,"Then she added irrelevantly, ""You ought to see the baby.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,107,"""I'd like to.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,108,"""She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,109,"""Never.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,110,"""Well, you ought to see her. She's """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,111,Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,112,"""What you doing, Nick?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,113,"""I' a bond man.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
114,114,"""Who with?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,115,I told him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,"""Never heard of them,"" he remarked decisively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,117,This annoyed me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,118,"""You will,"" I answered shortly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,119,"""You will if you stay in the East.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,120,"""Oh, I' stay in the East, don't you worry,"" he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,121,"""I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,122,"At this point Miss Baker said ""Absolutely!"" with such suddenness that I started it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,123,"Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,124,"""I' stiff,"" she complained, ""I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,"""Don't look at me,"" Daisy retorted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126,126,"""I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,127,"""No, thanks,"" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ""I' absolutely in training.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,128,Her host looked at her incredulously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,129,"""You are!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,130,He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
131,131,"""How you ever get anything done is beyond me.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
132,132,"I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she ""got done.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,133,I enjoyed looking at her.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,134,"She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,135,"Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,136,"It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,137,"""You live in West Egg,"" she remarked contemptuously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,138,"""I know somebody there.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,139,"""I don't know a single """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
140,140,"""You must know Gatsby.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,141,"""Gatsby?"" demanded Daisy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,142,"""What Gatsby?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,143,Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,144,"Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
145,145,"""Why candles?"" objected Daisy, frowning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
146,146,She snapped them out with her fingers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2816,2816,When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2817,2817,After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2818,2818,His pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2824,2824,"""Look there!"" and then sought admiration from my eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2825,2825,He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2849,2849,"He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2850,2850,A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2851,2851,So did Gatsby's father.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2852,2852,"And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2853,2853,The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2854,2854,But it wasn't any use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2855,2855,Nobody came.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2856,2856,"About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2857,2857,As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2858,2858,I looked around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2859,2859,It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2860,2860,I'd never seen him since then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2861,2861,I don't know how he knew about the funeral or even his name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2862,2862,The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2863,2863,"I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2864,2864,"Dimly I heard someone murmur ""Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,"" and then the owl-eyed man said ""Amen to that,"" in a brave voice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2865,2865,We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2866,2866,Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2867,2867,"""I couldn't get to the house,"" he remarked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2868,2868,"""Neither could anybody else.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2869,2869,"""Go on!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2870,2870,He started.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2871,2871,"""Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2872,2872,He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2873,2873,"""The poor son-of-a-bitch,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2874,2874,One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2875,2875,Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2876,2876,"I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations: ""Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?"" and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2877,2877,And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2878,2878,"When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2879,2879,"We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2880,2880,"That's my middle west not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2881,2881,"I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2882,2882,"I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2883,2883,"Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old even then it had always for me a quality of distortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2884,2884,West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2885,2885,"I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2886,2886,In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2887,2887,"Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2888,2888,Gravely the men turn in at a house the wrong house.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2889,2889,"But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2890,2890,"After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2891,2891,So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2892,2892,"There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2893,2893,But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2894,2894,"I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2895,2895,"She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2896,2896,When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2897,2897,"For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2898,2898,"""Nevertheless you did throw me over,"" said Jordan suddenly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2899,2899,"""You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2900,2900,We shook hands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2901,2901,"""Oh, and do you remember "" she added, "" a conversation we had once about driving a car?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2902,2902,"""Why not exactly.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2903,2903,"""You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2904,2904,"""I' thirty,"" I said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2905,2905,"""I' five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2906,2906,She didn't answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2907,2907,"Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2908,2908,One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2909,2909,"He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2910,2910,Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2911,2911,Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2912,2912,"""What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2913,2913,"""Yes. You know what I think of you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2914,2914,"""You're crazy, Nick,"" he said quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2915,2915,"""Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2916,2916,"""Tom,"" I inquired, ""what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2917,2917,He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2918,2918,I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2919,2919,"""I told him the truth,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2920,2920,"""He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2921,2921,He broke off defiantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2922,2922,"""What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2923,2923,"There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2924,2924,"""And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2925,2925,"I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2926,2926,It was all very careless and confused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2927,2927,"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2928,2928,"I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2929,2929,Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2930,2930,Gatsby's house was still empty when I left the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2931,2931,One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2932,2932,I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2933,2933,"I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2934,2934,One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2935,2935,But I didn't investigate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2936,2936,Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2937,2937,"On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2938,2938,"On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2939,2939,Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2940,2940,"Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
